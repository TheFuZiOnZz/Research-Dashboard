## 1960 U.S Exports Embargo on Cuba
- On October 19, 1960, almost two years after the Cuban Revolution had led to the deposition of the Batista regime, the U.S. placed an embargo on exports to Cuba except for food and medicine after Cuba nationalized American-owned Cuban oil refineries without compensation.

- President Eisenhower banned exports to Cuba, partly to assist Richard M. Nixon's presidential bid; Kennedy, in response, promises `to do something about Fidel Castro.` Initial purpose of sanctions thus is `to destabilize the Castro regime, causing its overthrow, or, at a minimum, to make an example of the regime by inflicting as much damage on it as possible.` [link](https://www.piie.com/publications/papers/sanctions-cuba-60-3.pdf)
- On February 7, 1962, the embargo was extended to include almost all exports. Since the year 2000, the embargo no longer prohibits the trade of food and humanitarian supplies. [link](https://www.piie.com/publications/papers/sanctions-cuba-60-3.pdf)
- The embargo is enforced mainly through the `Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917`, the `Foreign Assistance Act of 1961`, the `Cuban Assets Control Regulations of 1963`, the `Cuban Democracy Act of 1992`, the `Helms–Burton Act of 1996`, and the `Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000`.

- The U.S’s stated purpose of the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 was `to maintain sanctions on the Castro regime so long as it continues to refuse to move toward democratization and greater respect for human rights` [link](https://1997-2001.state.gov/www/regions/wha/cuba/democ_act_1992.html) As democracy is good, this seems valid as Cuba is not a democratic country.

    - A 2014 Paper found that `there is an economically and statistically significant positive correlation between democracy and future GDP per capita` [link](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w20004/w20004.pdf)
    - A data set found that `discounting "major democratic transitions" in political instability analyses tends to bias findings toward over-emphasizing the volatility and risk associated with democratic transitions and under-estimating the volatility and risk associated with autocratic regimes.` [link](http://www.systemicpeace.org/polity/PTfig03.htm)
    - A 1995 Paper found that `Among a variety of social diversity (e.g., race, ethnicity, religion, language), Socioeconomic, cultural, geographic, and other indicators, the best way to account for and predict democide is by the degree to which a regime is totalitarian along a democratic-totalitarian scale. That is, the extent to which a regime controls absolutely all social, economic, and cultural groups and institutions, the degree to which its elite can rule arbitrarily, largely accounts for the magnitude and intensity of genocide and mass murder.`
- `U.S. economic sanctions initially were prompted by the seizure of U.S. property in Cuba. The Cuban Government effectively took into state ownership most U.S.-owned property, with the exception of the United States Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay.` [link](https://www.usitc.gov/publications/332/pub3398.pdf) [p41]
- Cuba has since been allowed to buy food and medical devices from the US since 2000, because Bill Clinton signed a bill allowing this. [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20091225074635/http://www.fas.usda.gov/itp/cuba/title_ix.html)
- The embargo is not a blockade, It does not ban all trade to Cuba from the U.S. or the international community.
- Cuba and the U.S still trade with each other. Cuban Exports [link](https://oec.world/en/visualize/tree_map/hs92/import/usa/cub/show/2019/) are lower and minimal compared to Cuban Imports [link](https://oec.world/en/visualize/tree_map/hs92/import/cub/usa/show/2019/) but this is a loss for the U.S, not Cuba.
    - `The letter pegs the cost to the U.S. economy at $1.2 billion per year. The CPF’s estimates are much higher: up to $4.84 billion annually in lost sales and exports. The Cuban government estimates the loss to Cuba at about $685 million annually. Thus the blockade costs the United States up to $4.155 billion more a year than it costs Cuba.` [link](http://www.dollarsandsense.org/archives/2009/0309pepper.html)
- Cuba is a member of The World Trade Organisation (WTO) and The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)
    - `Cuba has been a member of WTO since 20 April 1995 and a member of GATT since 1 January 1948` [link](https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/countries_e/cuba_e.htm)
