## Wakefield’s Paper
- The `Vaccines Cause Autism` claim can be traced back to a, now retracted, 1998 study by Andrew Wakefield and 11 co-authors published in The Lancet titled `Ileal-lymphoid-nodular hyperplasia, non-specific colitis, and pervasive developmental disorder in children` [link](https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0140-6736%2897%2911096-0) claiming to find a correlation between the MMR vaccine and autism.
    - `In eight children, the onset of behavioural problems had been linked, either by the parents or by the child's physician, with measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination. Five had had an early adverse reaction to immunisation (rash, fever, delirium; and, in three cases, convulsions). In these eight children the average interval from exposure to first behavioural symptoms was 6·3 days (range 1–14). Parents were less clear about the timing of onset of abdominal symptoms because children were not toilet trained at the time or because behavioural features made children unable to communicate symptoms.`
    - `Fudenberg noted that for 15 of 20 autistic children, the first symptoms developed within a week of vaccination.`
        - The paper mentioned in Wakefield’s paper was authored by H. H. Fudenberg. In 1996, the time that Fudenberg study was published, Fudenberg didn't have a medical license. It was revoked in November 1995 because he was caught stealing controlled substances from his job for personal use.
            - `In November 1995, the South Carolina medical board found Fudenberg “guilty of engaging in dishonorable, unethical, or unprofessional conduct,” fined him $10,000, ordered him to surrender his license to prescribe controlled substances (narcotic drugs), and placed his license on indefinite suspension.  
                  
                ...  
                  
                The Respondent admitted that he has on numerous occasions obtained controlled substances and legend drugs, namely, prosom, ambien, lasix, and potassium from a member of his office staff and others, and that he has unlawfully obtained these controlled substances for his own use, and has, in fact, used these medications. The Respondent has admitted this conduct in sworn statements dated February 23, 1995 and March 1995, copies of which were incorporated into the Memorandum of Agreement and Stipulations.`

        - The Fudenberg paper was published in the journal Biotherapy, a journal now no longer receiving submissions as of 1998. [link](https://link.springer.com/journal/10537;;)

- On 28 January 2010, The Lancet then retracted the study after an inquiry by the British General Medical Council concluded that Wakefield had been dishonest in his research, had acted against his patients' best interests and mistreated developmentally delayed children,

- On 24 May 2010, Wakefield was struck off the UK medical register, in part for his deliberate falsification of research published in The Lancet and was barred from practising medicine in the UK.
    - `Accordingly the Panel has determined that Dr Wakefield’s name should be erased from the medical register. The Panel concluded that it is the only sanction that is appropriate to protect patients and is in the wider public interest, including the maintenance of public trust and confidence in the profession and is proportionate to the serious and wide-ranging findings made against him.` [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20110809092833/http://www.gmc-uk.org/Wakefield_SPM_and_SANCTION.pdf_32595267.pdf)
- On January 11 2011, an article by The Washington Post reporter Brian Deer identified further undisclosed financial conflicts of interest that Wakefield reportedly stood to earn up to $43 million per year selling test kits.

## Current Research
- A 2014 paper found that
    - `Eleven of the 12 identified reviews shared the current conclusion that there was no evidence for a link between vaccination and autistic spectrum disorder, advocating continuation of current immunisation practices` [link](https://sci-hub.ee/10.1016/j.vaccine.2014.04.085)
- A 2014 paper found that
    - `MMR vaccination and increased thimerosal exposure did not elevate the risk for ASD onset in this Japanese population. Therefore, there is no need to avoid these vaccinations due to concern of inducing ASD.` [link](https://sci-hub.ee/10.1016/j.vaccine.2014.12.036)
- A 2015 paper found that
    - `In this large sample of privately insured children with older siblings, receipt of the MMR vaccine was not associated with increased risk of ASD, regardless of whether older siblings had ASD. These findings indicate no harmful association between MMR vaccine receipt and ASD even among children already at higher risk for ASD.` [link](https://sci-hub.ee/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25898051)
