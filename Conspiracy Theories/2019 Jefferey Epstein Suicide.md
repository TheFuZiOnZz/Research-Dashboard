## OIG Report
- On
	- `We further noted that Epstein had previously been placed on suicide watch and psychological observation due to the events of July 23, 2019; that numerous nooses made from prison bed sheets were found in his
cell on the morning of August 10; and that he had signed a new Last Will and Testament on August 8, 2 days
before he died. No weapons were recovered from Epstein’s cell after his death. Additionally, the inmates
who were interviewed consistently reported that on the evening Epstein died the SHU staff did not
systematically conduct the required rounds and counts, which was one of the primary mechanisms for the
SHU staff to ensure the safety and security of inmates housed in the SHU. As a result, Epstein was
unmonitored and locked alone in his cell for hours with an excess amount of linens, which provided an
opportunity for him to commit suicide.` - [Investigation and Review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Custody, Care, and Supervision of Jeffrey Epstein at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York, New York, U.S. Office of the Inspector General, 2023](https://oig.justice.gov/sites/default/files/reports/23-085.pdf)
