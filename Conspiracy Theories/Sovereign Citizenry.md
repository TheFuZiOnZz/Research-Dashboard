## The United States is a Corporation
- Act of 1871
	- 
This is the how dumb people are in reading law.
If one read this and think this made them a corporation..

"28 U.S. Code § 3002 - Definitions 
Definition 
(15) “United States” means—
(A) a Federal corporation;
(B) an agency, department, commission, board, or other entity of the United States; or
(C) an instrumentality of the United States."

Their incompetence is incredulous..!  
You can't pull things out of context as you please. Cant read over the beginning

 "As used in this chapter:"

So the definition is only used in the chapter.  Well whats the use for defining it as such??
You'd know if you didn't skip that part, being incompetent, and cherry picking to make it fit a narrative!

"28 U.S. Code Subchapter A - DEFINITIONS AND GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 3001. Applicability of chapter
(a) In General.—Except as provided in subsection (b), the chapter provides the exclusive civil procedures for the United States—
(1) to recover a judgment on a debt; or
(2) to obtain, before judgment on a claim for a debt, a remedy in connection with such claim.

(b) Limitation.—
To the extent that another Federal law specifies procedures for recovering on a claim or a judgment for a debt arising under such law, those procedures shall apply to such claim or judgment to the extent those procedures are inconsistent with this chapter.


(c) Amounts Owing Other Than Debts.—
This chapter shall not apply with respect to an amount owing that is not a debt or to a claim for an amount owing that is not a debt."

The reason for the Defining it in the context as

"(15) “United States” means—

(A) a Federal corporation"

is to make it so that all political subdivisions ie. 

"(B) an agency, department, commission, board, or other entity of the United States; or

(C) an instrumentality of the United States" 

can be sued for being libelous in the same manner as a physical man/women. It makes the intangible fictitious collective called Government or States real per se in the court. 


THAT'S IT! only for that purpose! Not a conspicuous conspiracy..  context context context!  Read and learn how to read and interpret Legislative acts.  You'll find other actual conspiracies, like Statutes aren't law, they're only evidence of a law.. chew on that!
## There are Two U.S. Constitutions
