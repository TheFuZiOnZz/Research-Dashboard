Should we subsidize contraception in the United States?

1) Money is saved by the state.  
   1) A 2009 study, “Cost Savings From the Provision of Specific Methods of Contraception in a Publicly Funded Program,” “examined the cost-effectiveness of contraceptive methods dispensed in 2003 to 955 000 women in Family PACT (Planning, Access, Care and Treatment), California's publicly funded family planning program...The implant and intrauterine contraceptives were the most cost-effective, with cost savings of more than $7.00 for every $1.00 spent in services and supplies. Per $1.00 spent, injectable contraceptives yielded savings of $5.60; oral contraceptives, $4.07; the patch, $2.99; the vaginal ring, $2.55; barrier methods, $1.34; and emergency contraceptives, $1.43...All contraceptive methods were cost-effective—they saved more in public expenditures for unintended pregnancies than they cost to provide.” \[[source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2661445/)\] A similar study in 2014 in Colorado found the same, ”programs that increase LARC use among young, low-income women may contribute to declines in fertility rates, abortion rates and births among high-risk women.” \[[source](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1363/46e1714/full)\]  
   2) A study published in the National Bureau of Economic Research in October of 2017, “Our estimates suggest that due to the price hike, the weekly birth rate increased by 4%. We show large effects on the number of children born to unmarried mothers, from mothers in their early 20's, and to primiparae women. Moreover, we find evidence of significant deterioration of newborn health as measured by the incidence of low birthweight and infant mortality. We suggest that the “extra” conceptions faced dire conditions during gestation as a result of mothers' unhealthy behaviors. In addition, we document a disproportional increase of 27% in the weekly miscarriage and stillbirth rates, which we interpret as manifestations of active efforts of termination in a country where abortion was illegal. As the “extra” children reached school age, we find lower school enrollment rates and higher participation in programs for students with special needs. Our results suggest that access to contraceptives may prevent conceptions that will turn out to be in relatively poor health, and thereby may improve the average health of children conceived.” \[[source](http://www.nber.org/papers/w23911)\]  
2) Contributes to a reduced number of abortions.  
   1) Abortion rates have been falling since the 80’s, according to numbers from the CDC. \[[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_statistics_in_the_United_States)\]  
3) Less teen pregnancy.  
   1) According to a 2014 National Vital Statistics report teen pregnancy has fallen 57% between 1991 and 2013\. An analysis of data from two cycles of NSFG concluded that improved contraceptive use may have been the key factor behind the declines in teen birth rates. \[[source](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr63/nvsr63_04.pdf)\]  
   2) A study posted in the Quarterly Journal of Economics in 2006 asserts “The results suggest that legal access to the pill before age 21 significantly reduced the likelihood of a first birth before age 22, increased the number of women in the paid labor force, and raised the number of annual hours worked." Access to the pill before the age of 21 reduced the likelihood of being a mother before age 22 by 14-18%, and increased later employment between the ages of 26-30 by 8%.” \[[source](http://sci-hub.cc/10.1093/qje/121.1.289)\]  
   3) A study published by Harvard University and National Bureau of Economic Research presents evidence “establishing the “power of the pill” in lowering the costs of long-duration professional education for women and raising the age at first marriage." \[[source](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/2624453/goldin_powerpill.pdf?sequence=4)\]  
   4) In a study titled The Impact of Subsidized Birth Control for College Women: Evidence from the Deficit Reduction Act posted in 2013 (revised 2014\) shows “With the passage of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, Congress inadvertently and unexpectedly increased the effective price of birth control pills (“the Pill”) at college health centers more than three-fold, from $5 to $10 a month to between $30 to $50 a month. Using two different data sets, we employ multiple empirical strategies — including interrupted time-series, quasi-difference-in-differences, and fixed effects — for identification, and we find consistent results across data sets and methodologies. Our benchmark estimates show that this policy change reduced use of the Pill by at least 1.5 percentage points, or 3 to 4 percent, among all college women. For college women who lacked health insurance or carried large credit card balances, the decline was two to three times as large.” \[[source](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2269828)\]  
4) Health impact to women.  
   1) A 2005 study from the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology states “notable effects on the reproductive system include relief from troublesome symptoms associated with menstruation such as heavy periods, painful periods and irregular bleeding. Many women also have improvement in acne and hirsutism. Moreover, OCs may be used to treat menorrhagia or symptomatic endometriosis.” \[[source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16006440)\]  
   2) A large cohort study published in 2006 in the British Journal of Cancer shows “Uterine body cancer...and ovarian cancer...showed strong negative associations with duration of OC use...This apparent protective effect for both cancers persisted more than 20 years after stopping OCs. Combining data for cancers of the cervix, uterine body and ovary, the age adjusted RR for women ever using OCs compared with those never doing so was 0.7 (95%CI, 0.5–0.8). Beneficial effects of OCs on the gynaecological cancers thus outweighed adverse effects.” \[[source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2360655/)\]  
   3) A 2002 New England Journal of Medicine report shows a slightly increased risk of breast cancer. \[[source](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa013202#t=article)\]  
   4) A 2000 review published in JAMA shows Ischemic stroke risk is not elevated from BC. \[[source](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002937804001437)\]  
   5) Oral contraception is a standard treatment for PCOS (Polycystic ovary syndrome). \[[source](http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pcos/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20353443)\]  
5) Abstinence only education is ineffective.  
   1) A study published in the Journal of Adolescent Health in 2007 found that “Adolescents who received comprehensive sex education were significantly less likely to report teen pregnancy...than those who received no formal sex education, whereas there was no significant effect of abstinence-only education...teaching about contraception was not associated with increased risk of adolescent sexual activity or STD. Adolescents who received comprehensive sex education had a lower risk of pregnancy than adolescents who received abstinence-only or no sex education.” \[[source](http://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X\(07\)00426-0/fulltext?cc=y=)\]
