# Alpha/Beta
## What is an Alpha Male?
- (Personal note: It feels as though there is no consistent definition of what an “alpha male” or “high value male” actually is. It’s essential to nail this down, because an “alpha male” is going to be playing the “alpha” side of the “Alpha Fucks, Beta Bucks” dual-mating strategy that Rollo claims women employ. It’s also reasonable to assume that men are going to want to strive to become an “alpha male” and avoid being a “beta male” in the Red Pill space.)
- Alphas are not “bad boys” in any kingdom that has an actual alpha hierarchy. They display lots of prosocial behavior, almost necessarily, in wolves and in primates.
    - “Interestingly, while advocates for acting dominant often point to chimps as proof of the exclusivity of this route to male status, recent research has shown that even among primates, alpha male status can be achieved not only through size and strength but through adept sociability and the grooming of others as well.” - Scott Barry Kaufman [article](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/the_myth_of_the_alpha_male) from 2015 from the Greater Good Science Center.
    - “With most mammals, the biggest and most aggressive male claims the alpha male role and gets his choice of food and females. But a new study suggests that at least among chimpanzees, smaller, more mild-mannered males can also use political behavior to secure the top position.” - Mark Foster, [Small Male Chimps Use Politics, Rather Than Aggression, To Lead The Pack](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/02/090202174958.htm) (2009), American Journal of Primatology
    - “I conclude that the typical wolf pack is a family, with the adult parents guiding the activities of the group in a division-of-labor system in which the female predominates primarily in such activities as pup care and defense and the male primarily during foraging and food-provisioning and the travels associated with them.” By David Mech, [Alpha status, dominance, and division of labor in wolf packs](https://web.archive.org/web/20051214072331/http://www.npwrc.usgs.gov/resource/2000/alstat/alstat.htm) (1999), Canadian Journal of Zoology.
    - “They identified one chimp, Foudouko, as the alpha leader. Two years later he fell from power, overthrown by a group of younger males. He lived on the outskirts of the group for years before attempting to return in mid-2013. He was killed by his former followers, a rare instance in which a chimp was killed within its own community.” By Michael Greshko, “[In Rare Killing, Chimpanzees Cannibalize Former Leader](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/chimpanzees-murder-cannibalism-senegal)”(2017), National Geographic.
## If “Alpha Fucks, and Beta Bucks,” then how is the alpha an actual alpha?
- If a man is the “beta bucks,” it sounds as though he’s able to procure enough resources to be considered a “provider.” He’s also probably displaying lots of prosocial behavior, which is also “alpha” in nature. What kind of evolutionary model of the world associates someone who can adapt to an environment and provide resources as a “beta”? Why would women be drawn to anti-social men who provide fewer resources?
    - No one seems to be utilizing this strategy, as evidenced from studying extra-partner pairings.
        1. “A common urban myth is that many fathers are cuckolded into raising children that genetically are not their own. This fear is fuelled not just by the paternity tests that have become a standard staple of gossip magazines, talk shows, and TV series but also by the biological fact that in many socially monogamous species, females appear to regularly engage in mating outside the long-term pair bond…The surprising result of these new studies is that human EPP rates have stayed near-constant at around 1% across several human societies over the past several hundred years. This poses an immediate puzzle for behavioural scientists, who estimated that without the availability of modern contraceptives the historical EPP rates should have been much higher, in the range of 10–20%, based on present behavioural measures of EPCs and observed kin investments of matri- and patrilineal family members, which are known to be inversely related to EPP [13].” Maarten H.D. Larmuseau, Koen Matthijs, Tom Wenseleers (2016), [Cuckolded Fathers Rare in Human Populations,](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534716000707) Trends in Ecology & Evolution
        2. “Using patrilineal genealogies from the Low Countries spanning a period of over 500 years and Y chromosome genotyping of living descendants, our analysis reveals that historical EPP rates, while low overall, were strongly impacted by socioeconomic and demographic factors. Specifically, we observe that estimated EPP rates among married couples varied by more than an order of magnitude, from 0.4% to 5.9%, and peaked among families with a low socioeconomic background living in densely populated cities of the late 19th century.” Maarten H.D. Larmuseau, Pieter van den Berg, Sofie Claerhout, ..., Kelly Nivelle, Ronny Decorte, Tom Wenseleers.(2019) [A Historical-Genetic Reconstruction of Human Extra-Pair Paternity.](https://www.cell.com/current-biology/pdfExtended/S0960-9822(19)31305-3) Current Biology, 29, 4102–4107
            - 1%-6% at its highest shows that monogamy is the dominant mating strategy.
        3. Population-wide research of modern Europeans shows very low rates of extra-pair paternity, between 1-2% (Anderson, 2006 & Wolf et al., 2012, as cited in Larmuseau). Y-chromosome research indicating historical trends shows a similarly low rate between 1-2% for non-Western populations (Strassmann et al., 2012, as cited in Larmuseau) and for historical Western populations (Larmuseau, 2012; Greef & Erasmus, 2015; Boattini et al., 2015; Solé-Morata et al., 2015, as cited in Larmuseau 2016).
- If he’s married, he’s probably already at the top of society and passes a ton of markers for being an “alpha.”
    - They make more money.
        1. “Using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel, it is found that married men enjoy a wage premium even after controlling for self-selection into marriage. In contrast to the popular household specialization hypothesis, men do not substantially reduce their housework time following marriage; neither does the housework time significantly affect the wage rate. This finding contrasts the prevailing view that the wage differential between married and single men results from the division of labour within the household. However, men married to non-working partners receive a larger wage premium than men married to full-time working wives. It is further shown that married men feel less satisfied with their financial situation as compared to their single counterparts. These results indicate that a lower level of pay satisfaction induce married men to put more effort into their work, which leads to higher wages.” Matthias Pollmann-Schult, [Marriage and Earnings: Why Do Married Men Earn More than Single Men?](https://academic.oup.com/esr/article-abstract/27/2/147/424307) (2011), European Sociological Review.
    - They live longer and enjoy better physical health.
        1. “A major survey of 127,545 American adults found that married men are healthier than men who were never married or whose marriages ended in divorce or widowhood. Men who have marital partners also live longer than men without spouses; men who marry after age 25 get more protection than those who tie the knot at a younger age, and the longer a man stays married, the greater his survival advantage over his unmarried peers.” Harvard medical school article, [Marriage and men’s health](https://www.health.harvard.edu/mens-health/marriage-and-mens-health), June 5th, 2019
    - They have more children.
        1. “The present findings from a nationally representative sample of Americans living in the late 20th century support the hypothesis that serial monogamy is positively associated with reproductive success in men.” Jokela, M., Rotkirch, A., Rickard, I. J., Pettay, J., & Lummaa, V. (2010). [Serial monogamy increases reproductive success in men but not in women.](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2010-18254-004) Behavioral Ecology, 21(5), 906–912.
        2. Serial monogamy is the primary reproductive strategy, not polygamy or “alpha fucks” everyone.
- Rollo regularly has referenced “the pool boy” in various [tweets](https://twitter.com/RationalMale/status/1527693786146557952) and [writings](https://therationalmale.com/2012/04/23/relationship-game-wife-sex/) for over a decade. What makes the Pool Boy an alpha male? He provides no resources, is not at the top of any social hierarchy, does not engage in prosocial behavior, etc…
Random Factoid
- Rollo has [claimed](https://www.youtube.com/live/HozT-YdG2QQ?feature=share&t=7021) that “a woman’s female ovum will select between competing male’s sperm at the site of conception, meaning that adaptation had to have become useful because there were multiple men’s sperm at the site of conception.”
    - Why does Rollo believe multiple men’s sperm are necessary for ovum to engage in discriminatory behavior of different sperm? Does he believe every single male sperm is identical?
    - Actual answer: women's eggs release a chemoattractant that is selecting for major histocompatibility complex, or a set of genetic factors that are responsible for immune system response and fighting infections. It has nothing to do with selecting for “alpha” or “beta” partners and only attempts to ensure a strong immune profile, especially in cases of preventing low genetic diversity among people who may be attempting to inbreed.
## Do you still believe in Pair Bonding? Why would women’s sexual strategy of simultaneously having sex with a beta and an alpha play contrary to their built in desires to pair with only a single person?
- Pair bonding is largely a myth.
    - Pair bonding occurs when two animals form life-long connections with each other, rarely, if ever, cheat, and do not take new partners once the other is dead.
    - No primates found in nature form life-long pair bonds.
    - Less than 3% of mammals form pair bonds.
    - Humans practice “serial monogamy” reproductive strategy, which is advantageous for men, regarding number of offspring.
- Oxytocin time.
    - Oxytocin is released in both men and women during many social activities where bonding occurs. Oxytocin nasal sprays have shown an increase in empathetic responses to perceived “in-group” members. Many different studies around the world show that oxytocin can be administered to increase protective and preferential feelings towards “in-group” members.
## While you eager to initially accept findings from evolutionary psychology, why do you run away from them now that the field is turning away from strategic pluralism, or “alpha fucks, beta bucks”? Do you at least recognize that your position is no longer scientific?
- One of the early proponents of “strategic pluralism,” Steven W. Gangestad, recently did an amazing literature review of the empirical failings of said mating strategy.
- The following comes from [Women's Estrus and Extended Sexuality: Reflections on Empirical Patterns and Fundamental Theoretical Issues](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.900737/full), by Steven W. Gangestad and Tran Dinh, published in Evolutionary Psychology in June of 2022.
    - “Comparatively, the fact that women lack sexual swellings or ritualized behavioral cues overlapping with the conceptive phase is revealing about the potential function of their extended sexuality. It likely has not been shaped to facilitate paternity confusion. Strassmann's (1981) explanation of concealed ovulation, broadened to include extended sexuality, may offer one plausible scenario for the evolution of women's extended sexuality. Strassmann argued that, in a species in which males may potentially engage in true paternal care, males most likely to benefit from caring are non-dominant males. Following successful reproduction, males can choose to invest in care or re-enter the mating market to compete for another fertilization (or some combination of these two). The benefits of engaging in care partly depend on the net benefits (e.g., the rate of success) of competing for mating (e.g., Kokko and Jennions, 2008). Non-dominant males benefit less from competing and, therefore, are most likely to benefit from investment in care. As a result, females evolved to prefer non-dominant males as sires for the benefits of paternal care. Accordingly, concealing their conceptive status prevented dominant males from systematically monopolizing conceptive matings through intrasexual competition against non-dominant males (for a discussion of potential contributions of female-female intrasexual competition to the evolution of undisclosed conceptive status in humans, see Krems et al., 2021). As Kokko and Jennions (2008) emphasize, male benefits to investment in care also crucially depend on paternity assurance. In Strassmann's scenario, the concealment of ovulation permits non-dominant males to become sires but also limits their access to cues to conceptive status. Hence, males do not attain paternity assurance through detection of fertility cues. Rather, paternity assurance is achieved through regular sexual access throughout the cycle of a target female (some portion of which is conceptive), in conjunction with reasonable confidence that other males have not engaged in sex with that female during the cycle.”
        - Since women do not go “in heat” and give no external sexual cues to her fertility, “alpha” men would have no way to swoop in and impregnate the woman during her fertile cycle. Men who engage in such behavior, rather than men who continuously mate for extended periods of time, are less likely to find success reproducing. Men are therefore selected to be non-dominant, and women are therefore selecting non-dominant men as they are more likely to remain as primary caretakers.
    - “In our recently collected dataset of 181 women, we examined moderating impacts of ovarian hormone levels on the association between male partners' attractiveness and women's extra-pair sexual interests (Dinh et al., 2022a). Analyses found that when women's progesterone levels were low—characteristic of the follicular and peri-ovulatory phase—partner attractiveness more strongly predicted extra-pair interest in a negative direction, consistent with previous effects. However, some preregistered effects examined were near-zero. All in all, the null hypothesis that there exist no effects is a very poor explanation of the overall pattern of results, even if we currently do not fully understand the reasons for variable effects (Dinh et al., 2022a,b)10. This moderation effect, if robust, begs a question. This effect assumes that women differentially value sexually attractive features across conceptive versus non-conceptive phases. Yet, as we discussed above, large-scale replication studies have not found strong, compelling evidence for hormonal moderation of mate preferences (e.g., for muscular bodies). Durante et al. (2016) suggested one possible resolution. Perhaps mate preference shifts are moderated. For instance, women who are strongly attached to partners may express relatively little interest in extra-pair men when conceptive. It may make sense that these women also show little evidence of increased interest in, say, muscular men when conceptive. The same may apply for women with attractive partners—or, more generally, women who show relatively little interest in extra-pair men during conceptive phases for other reasons. By contrast, when women do express interest in extra-pair men when conceptive, they may be particularly interested in muscular men. This may be one reason why preference shifts are weak overall and not consistently detected. It also remains untested to date.”
        - Essentially, even if women’s interests are changing slightly due to hormone cycles, no study has shown that a woman is more willing to “cheat” or engage in extra-pair sexual activity.
            - Dixson et al., 2018; Jones et al., 2018c,d; Jünger et al., 2018a,b; Marcinkowska et al., 2018; Stern et al., 2019, 2020, 2021)
                - All failed to find women choosing different mates based on their ovulation cycle.
# Hypergamy
## What is hypergamy?
- Massive discussion paper from the Institute of Labor Economics, “[The Economics of Hypergamy](https://cepr.org/publications/dp17914)”, by Ingvild Almas et al.
    - “Using evidence from more than 33 million marriages and 67 million births in England and Wales 1837-2022 we show that there was never within this era any period of significant hypergamous marriage by women. The average status of women’s fathers was always close to that of their husbands’ fathers. Consistent with this there was no differential tendency in England of men and women to marry by social status. The evidence is of strong symmetry in marital behaviors between men and women throughout. There is also ancillary evidence that physical attraction cannot have been a very significant factor in marriages in any period 1837-2021, based on the correlation observed in underlying social abilities.”
    - “There is good evidence that women value status more, and physical appearance less, than do men in forming marriages. Yet the popular belief that this produces significant female hypergamy in marriage is incorrect. In England all the way from 1837 to 2021 we find that female marital hypergamy was extremely modest. The average difference between men and women in marriage in terms of their family status was modest and at times non-existent. In terms of family status, matching in marriage was nearly symmetrical between men and women. The male preference for physical attraction would be predicted to reduce the correlation between marital partners in family status. But this was the same effect for women as compared to men.”
## If women are hypergamous, why do men cheat more?
- Men still [report](https://today.yougov.com/topics/society/articles-reports/2022/10/04/how-many-americans-have-cheated-their-partner-poll) cheating in a 2022 YouGov poll 2x as much as women in the US, even though they consider fewer things to be “cheating” than women do. A 2018 study by the Institute of Family Studies researcher Wendy Wang [reports](https://ifstudies.org/blog/predicting-infidelity-an-updated-look-at-who-is-most-likely-to-cheat-in-america) similarly that 20% of men and 10% of women have cheated in a marriage.
- Rollo [tweeted](https://twitter.com/RationalMale/status/979589521011482625) in 2018 “Guys will berate other guys for cheating. We tell him, at least be a Man and break up with her first. Girls don’t do this. They believe it’s a woman’s prerogative to cheat and keep their LTR in the dark if it means optimizing Hypergamy. The Sisterhood has no code like men do.”
- Men’s reported rates of cheating is almost 2x as much as women, and this holds true across almost all cultures.
- If women have unprecedented access to “alphas” via Tinder and IG, and social encouragement to cheat, and biological imperative to cheat, shouldn’t women be cheating far, far more than men?
- In 2018, Rollo [wrote](https://therationalmale.com/2018/01/15/hypergamy-the-misconceptions/): “Hypergamy is an evolved social dynamic. That is to say it is the behavioral extension of biological factors; most notably Ovulatory Shift.” Since there is no research supporting this idea of the “dual-mating” hypothesis, is Rollo prepared to walk back the idea of women being hypergamous?
- In a [2021 YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyR6FcT7ozQ&t=837s), Rollo brought up the 17 women for every 1 man hypothesis.
    - This comes from a 2015 study
        - “Researchers discovered a dramatic decline in genetic diversity in male lineages 4,000 to 8,000 years ago – likely the result of the accumulation of material wealth, while in contrast, female genetic diversity was on the rise. This male-specific decline occurred during the mid- to late-Neolithic period. “Instead of ‘survival of the fittest’ in a biological sense, the accumulation of wealth and power may have increased the reproductive success of a limited number of ‘socially fit’ males and their sons,” said Melissa Wilson Sayres, a leading author and assistant professor with ASU’s School of Life Sciences.”
    - Stanford researches [respond](https://news.stanford.edu/press-releases/2018/05/30/war-clan-structubiological-event/) in 2018
        - “Certainly, the researchers point out, social structures were changing. After the onset of farming and herding around 12,000 years ago, societies grew increasingly organized around extended kinship groups, many of them patrilineal clans – a cultural fact with potentially significant biological consequences. The key is how clan members are related to each other. While women may have married into a clan, men in such clans are all related through male ancestors and therefore tend to have the same Y chromosomes. From the point of view of those chromosomes at least, it’s almost as if everyone in a clan has the same father.”
        - Researchers respond on Reddit with even more precision
            - “(A) for the ratio effective population sizes among males and females to have stayed around approximately 1:17 across much of the Old World for approximately 1500 years requires an implausible level of polygamy and hereditary inequality. Extreme polygamy, with more than say 3 wives to a man, or highly transmissible differences in reproductive success due to extreme wealth distributions are characteristic of large-scale complex societies or “civilisations”; they are unlikely to be sustained in a small-scale society that we see just after the Neolithic transition to farming and herding. Such small-scale societies still exist in Amazonia and in Papua New Guinea, and until recently in India, Africa, some parts of Southwest China and Southeast Asia, and the Pacific. From ethnography, we know that rates of polygamous marriage in small-scale societies rarely exceed 15%, and usually with at most two wives.”
            - “(B) In every part of the Old World, the bottleneck lifts approximately 5000-4000 years ago. This is precisely the period when chiefdoms and states first emerge, often associated with extreme inequality. Mass human sacrifice, for example, is commonly seen in the first states. However the emergence of chiefdoms and states is associated with the lifting of the bottleneck, not its intensification.”
            - “Because patrilineal social organisation sorts males into groups with identical or closely related Y-chromosomes, wars and feuds between such groups, even if it leads to a low level of group extinction per generation, strongly depresses diversity over 60 generations (~1500 years). Put differently, entire branches of the Y-chromosomal genetic tree may become extinct when social groups go extinct. Up to twentyfold reductions in diversity are possible with very little or no change in male population size over 60 generations. On the other hand, women tend to marry between kinship groups in patrilineal societies, and so diversity in mtDNA will be spared. These observations are confirmed by our simulation outputs, which can be found in the Supplementary Material. Fig 5 of our paper also shows a series of graphs corresponding to one set of simulations. Our model shows that up to a twenty-fold reduction Y-chromosome diversity can be produced without fluctuations in total male population size provided that the population was organised into patrilineal kinship groups that were, so to speak, the relevant "units of conflict" at the time.”
            - “Our hypothesis regarding the bottleneck also conforms with historical and anthropological data. Before the Neolithic and prior to the bottleneck, i.e. before the spread of farming and herding, all our ancestors were hunter-gatherers, and hunter-gatherers tend not to be organised into purely kinship-based social groups. Most hunter-gatherer bands contain large fractions of nonkin. With the rise of states and chiefdoms after the bottleneck, large political units integrating many kinship groups also comprise a new form of society, and the defeat of political units, i.e. other states or chiefdoms, was less or not associated with the extinction of kinship groups. So the bottleneck took place after the Neolithic but before the rise of states and chiefdoms, when the "units of conflict" among the small scale societies at the time were still kinship-based small-scale societies, commonly patrilineal tribes. Therefore, a Y-chromosome bottleneck at 5k-7k BP.”
## If women are hypergamous, how do you explain their attractions to pool boys and gang members?
- It seems as though “pool boys” and “gangsters” represent the bottom of society in several ways, but, most importantly, they lack the ability to provision resources, which is arguably the key feature of an alpha.
- It’s not clear that having these “alpha traits” even gets men more play, for example:
    - In a [2015 study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1474704915604563) published in Evolutionary Psychology by Frederick and Jenkins, 60,058 heterosexual participants, in which 52% were men, were surveyed on average sexual partners, with height and BMI being two factors they looked at.
        - Height
            - very short (5′2″–5′4″; 1%): 9.4 partners
            - short (5′5″–5′7″; 9%): 11.0 partners
            - average (5′8″–5′10″; 33%): 11.7 partners
            - tall (5′11″–6′1″; 40%): 12.0 partners
            - very tall (6′2″–6′4″; 15%): 12.1 partners
            - extremely tall (6′5″+; 2%): 12.3 partners
        - BMI
            - Underweight: 8.2
            - Normal Weight: 10.9
            - Overweight: 12
            - Obese: 11.7
            - Obese III: 9.3
        - “ Interestingly, however, men’s reported sexual behavior only partially reinforced the preference data. Consistent with the idea that women prefer relatively tall men, the shortest men in the sample reported fewer partners than other men. These findings confirm that height is relevant on the mating market. Across most of the height continuum, however, there was little variation in mean or median number of reported sex partners. Further, men between 5′7″ and 6′3″ (170–191 cm) varied little in whether they had more than 5 partners, had more than 14 partners, engaged in extra-pair sex, or were currently single.”

            - 79.9% of custodial parents in the US are mothers, though that’s down about 3 points from 2014, so the trend is slowly reversing.
            - Only 4% of child custody cases require a trial.
                - These are very, very, very rare things that the manosphere seem to base their entire understanding of “divorce” around!
            - In 2017, full child support payments were received by 46.4% and 43.1% of custodial mothers and fathers, respectively.
    - They win custody if they fight for it.
        - Quoting from an old Massachusetts gender bias study, published in the New England Law Review, Spring of 1990, [Gender Bias Study of the Court System in Massachusetts](https://amptoons.com/blog/files/Massachusetts_Gender_Bias_Study.htm)
            - “We began our investigation of child custody aware of a common perception that there is a bias in favor of women in these decisions. Our research contradicted this perception. Although mothers more frequently get primary physical custody of children following divorce, this practice does not reflect bias but rather the agreement of the parties and the fact that, in most families, mothers have been the primary [748] caretakers of children. Fathers who actively seek custody obtain either primary or joint physical custody over 70% of the time. Reports indicate, however, that in some cases perceptions of gender bias may discourage fathers from seeking custody and stereotypes about fathers may sometimes affect case outcomes. In general, our evidence suggests that the courts hold higher standards for mothers than fathers in custody determinations.”
    - Alimony is rare.
        - Quoting from a [legal blog](https://www.marseelaw.com/gender-and-alimony-who-gets-it-who-pays-it-whats-changing/#:~:text=In%20the%201960s%2C%2025%20percent,is%20closer%20to%2010%20percent.)
            - “Today, it is far less common for anybody, male or female, to receive alimony after divorce than it was in the past. In the 1960s, 25 percent of divorce settlements included alimony orders. Now, this figure is closer to 10 percent. Women are still the primary alimony recipients, but the number of men who receive alimony from their former spouses is increasing. According to the 2000 census, 0.5 percent of alimony recipients in the United States were male. By 2010, 3 percent of the 400,000 alimony recipients in the country were male.
    - The divorce rate has been [falling](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/10/divorce-united-states-dropping-because-millennials/) since the 90’s, from 4.8/1,000 to 3.2/1,000.

## What has the prosecutor been saying in court? (Statement from the prosecutor in the 10th January preventive arrest appeal hearing)
[https://www.docdroid.net/Xctlxsd/motivare-tate-1-pdf](https://www.docdroid.net/Xctlxsd/motivare-tate-1-pdf)
The representative of the Public Prosecutor's Office, having the floor, requests the dismissal of the appeals filed by the four defendants, considering the fact that the judge's decision of rights and liberties within the Bucharest Tribunal, which ordered the preventive arrest, is legal, thoroughly, widely, and convincingly motivated. He emphasizes that it was correctly found that the provisions of art. 202 paragraph 1 of the Penal Procedure Code are applicable, considering that from the evidence administered in this case, a reasonable suspicion arises that the defendants committed the crimes of establishing an organized criminal group and trafficking in persons, for which they are being criminally prosecuted.
In essence, he points out that the evidence, corroborating each other, includes the statements of the injured persons U.A., G. E. A, A S A., P. C – D, the reports of reproducing conversations conducted through the Whatsapp application, online investigation reports, computer search reports, psychological expert reports regarding the injured persons U.A. and G. E. A. From this evidence, the concrete modality of committing the crimes, the hierarchy within the criminal group, and the role of each of its members are revealed.
Thus, the defendants A. T. and T. T. had the role of recruiting victims who were transported and sheltered in residences in Romania, while the defendants N. G. M. and R. A. L. had the role of supervising and coordinating the entire exploitation activity.
From the conversations of the injured person U.A. with the defendant A. T., it resulted that this defendant is the one who leads the organized criminal group.
He states that the recruitment of victims by the defendants A. T. and T. T. was done by the so-called "loverboy" method, the defendants identified vulnerable persons, exploited their need for affection and trust, gave them the impression of a close relationship, after which the victims were sexually exploited by forcing them to perform pornographic acts and subjected to forced labor.
The defendants N. G. M. and R. A. L. had a very important contribution, they carried out constant surveillance of the victims, coordinating their daily activities and exerting physical and psychological pressure for the victims to work as much as possible.
He argues that all the evidence referred to and the factual situation are broadly analyzed in the contested decision, under this aspect the criticisms formulated by the defendants' lawyers being unfounded.
The prosecution cannot fail to note the fact that the defendants' lawyers contradict their own statements when they vehemently argue that there is no evidence or serious indications in support of the accusations, but they request more lenient preventive measures, such as house arrest or judicial control. Article 202 paragraph 1 of the Penal Procedure Code is very clear, all preventive measures can be taken only if there is evidence or serious indications that a person has committed a crime.
If they request more lenient preventive measures, they implicitly acknowledge the existence of evidence or serious indications that the defendants they defend have committed the crimes for which they were arrested and, consequently, in the prosecutor's opinion, they can no longer credibly criticize this aspect.
The defendants' lawyers claimed that the conversations conducted through electronic messaging applications were not legally obtained, these claims are unfounded, because some of the conversations were obtained following computer searches authorized by a judge, and access to computer systems made available by the injured persons were also made, with the authorization or confirmation of the judge.
Also, according to art. 139 paragraph 3 first thesis of the Penal Procedure Code, the recordings made by the parties or by other persons constitute evidence when they concern their own conversations or communications they had with third parties.
Regarding the claims of the defense, in the sense that the extrajudicial psychological expert reports would have certain legality flaws, he believes that these expertises respect the provisions of art. 97 of the Penal Code, and the judge appreciated these pieces of evidence within the overall administered evidence and appreciated them based on art. 103 of the Penal Procedure Code, so there was no misleading of the judge of rights and liberties from the Bucharest Tribunal on the part of the prosecutor's office with regard to these expertises.
He considers that the judge correctly considered that the crimes of establishing an organized criminal group and trafficking in persons fall among the crimes provided by art. 223 paragraph 2 of the Penal Procedure Code and, also correctly, found that the deprivation of liberty of the four defendants is necessary to remove a concrete danger to public order, considering the following: the nature and seriousness of the committed crimes, namely the establishment of an organized criminal group and several human trafficking offenses, the concrete way of committing the acts, namely by physical, psychological and verbal violence, taking advantage of the victims' vulnerability, adopting an insidious behavior with the purpose of misleading the victims, the purpose of committing the crimes which is to profit from the exploitation of the victims seen only as merchandise, the consequences produced towards the victims, especially the irreversible psychological impact on them, as evidenced by the psychological expert reports that were contested by the defendants' lawyers, without having a reasonable argument, in the prosecutor's office opinion.
Psychological and verbal violence exercised to coerce the victims are found in almost all the conversations between the defendants and the victims. Thus, the defendant N. G.-M., whom her lawyer claims to have a too frail physical constitution to be able to coerce the victims in any way, never misses an opportunity to insult, or even threaten with death.
For example, in the conversations reproduced on pages .....-49 of the contested decision, the defendant N. G. tells Iasmina P. : " I, I'll punch you in the mouth, until I get there, because then I'll give you ten more, you incurable lazy, I'll break you when I get there." And in the conversation mentioned on pages 111-112 of the report with the proposal for preventive arrest, the same defendant tells Iasmina P. that she might end up straight in the morgue if she doesn't post enough videos.
The same acts of coercion were also exercised by the defendant R. L., who, as a former policewoman, knew very well what she was doing. For example, from the statement of the injured person P C it results that when she wanted to leave, the defendants R. L. and N. G. opposed, N. G. put her hand in her throat, pushed her under a desk, asking her "where does she think she's going", and R. L. told her that it's useless to try to go to the police because nothing can happen to them, considering that she has relations in the police and in DIICOT.
The victims are seen only as profit-producing commodities, some of them being almost completely depersonalized and dehumanized. For example, P.I (Jasmina). Defendant A.T. repeatedly addresses her only as "whore", all other defendants insult her, but P.I. has no more reaction, she has already been "brainwashed", according to the victim U.A's statement.
The criminal activity of these defendants is a form of slavery, in the prosecutor's opinion. Just like the slave owners from the United States of the 19th century, who marked their slaves with red iron, so do defendants A.T. and T.T. mark their victims with tattoos from which it can be concluded that they are in the defendants' property. For example, tattoos with the message "owned by T." in English.
He believes that the judge from the Bucharest Tribunal correctly appreciated that the arrest of the defendants is necessary for the good progress of the criminal trial, considering that persons who might have knowledge about the criminal activities of the defendants are to be heard, some victims still being under the control and influence of the defendants. For this reason, he asks the judges of rights and freedoms from the Bucharest Court of Appeal not to consider the four notarial declarations, dated 09.01.2023, filed by the defendants' defenders at the trial, statements given by the guards at the scene and two of the victims.
The judge from the Bucharest Tribunal correctly appreciated that the arrest of the defendants is necessary to avoid their eluding criminal prosecution or trial, considering their financial possibilities and the public declarations of defendant A.T., who stated that, in case the risk of going to prison arises, he can leave the country's territory without problems.
The judge from the Bucharest Tribunal correctly appreciated that the arrest of the defendants is necessary to prevent the commission of other crimes.
Defendant A.T. is not just a defendant who committed the crime of human trafficking. In the prosecutor's opinion, he is, to the same extent, a theoretician of the crime of human trafficking, disseminating through social networks, his primitive conceptions about how women can be exploited, having tens of thousands of followers.
Moreover, he publicly stated that Romania has easily corruptible authorities and the laws are very permissive.
Considering these aspects, the lack of a strong response from the judicial bodies towards the acts committed by the defendants would encourage these defendants and other people to commit or continue to commit such acts, especially in Romania.
It should also be taken into account that defendants A.T. and T.T. committed the crimes also through information technology, so if other preventive measures than preventive detention would be taken against them, such as judicial control or home arrest, as requested, these would not prevent them from continuing their criminal activity, considering that the judicial bodies would no longer be able to exercise efficient control over them.
Regarding the proportionality of preventive arrest with the gravity of the accusation, he points out that there is clearly such proportionality. This is the reason why the legislator provided in art. 153 para. 2 letter c of the Criminal Code that the crime of human trafficking is imprescriptible and has placed, under this aspect, the crime of human trafficking alongside murder, genocide, and crimes against humanity and war crimes.
He also points out that the lawyers' statements, claiming that the victims are in friendly relations with the defendants and that they would have only benefited from the defendants and that they voluntarily came to the defendants, are unfounded. These are usual defenses of human traffickers and the legislator anticipated such situations and provided in art. 210 para. 3 of the Criminal Code that the consent of the person victim of human trafficking does not constitute a justifying cause, a legal text that cancels all the defenders' assertions.
The lawyers' claim that preventive arrest is not necessary because nine months have passed since the start of the criminal investigation, during which time the defendants did not evade investigation, is unfounded. In these nine months, the defendants were witnesses, not suspects or defendants, and DIICOT, before requesting preventive arrest, had to administer evidence corroborating the victims' statements. During this period, thousands of pages of conversations between the victims and the defendants were transcribed and translated into Romanian, extracting the parts relevant to the case. Only after it was confirmed that these conversations corroborated the victims' statements, could the proposal for preventive arrest be made.
Thus, the prosecution fully complied with the provisions of art. 305, para. 1 and 3 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which states that when the complaint meets the conditions provided by law, the criminal investigation body orders the start of the criminal investigation regarding the committed or planned act, even if the author is indicated or known. If there is evidence giving rise to reasonable suspicion that a certain person committed the act for which the criminal investigation has begun and none of the cases provided for in art. 16, para. 1, the criminal investigation body orders that the criminal investigation continue against this person, who gains the status of a suspect.
The lawyers' claim that the victims could have left at any time is unfounded and tries to ridicule the victims. The victims' statements show that they were always accompanied, the defendants' conversations show that they were forbidden to leave the house alone, and the victim G. E. A's statement reveals that there were armed guards in the yard. G. E. A also explains that she did not call the police because defendant T. T. scared her, giving her the impression that she was always watched by surveillance cameras placed throughout the house. She noted that once, while she was writing something, T. T. sent her a message saying that he saw her writing.
The defendants' lawyers claimed that there is no evidence, medical-legal documents, to prove physical violence. There are no such medical-legal documents because the defendants acted cunningly, without leaving traces. For example, from the victim A S A's statement, it appears that defendant N. G., to avoid leaving traces of violence on the body of one of the girls who had recently undergone a breast implant, lifted her arm to break the operation, after which she stated that "she is not stupid enough to hit her and leave traces".
Regarding the defendants A. T. and T. T.'s prior encounters with criminal law, he points out that from the report dated 20.07.2022, drafted by the police, it appears that the authorities from the United Kingdom have communicated, through the International Police Cooperation Centre, that defendant A. T. has two offenses against the person and two sexual offenses, and defendant T. T. has committed offenses against the person. He believes that this information proves A. T. and T. T.'s inclination towards physical and sexual abuses, and the criminal records from Romania, submitted by their defenders, in which this data from abroad does not appear, are irrelevant.
The claim by A. T.'s lawyer that, from the video content posted on social networks, the defendant is only playing some characters cannot be accepted, and the judge from the Bucharest Tribunal rightly did not accept it because he shows the same attitude in his relations with the victims, as clearly appears from his conversations with them.
The defendants' statements are insincere and do not corroborate with the rest of the evidence administered in the case. Today, they tried to soften the statements they gave at the Bucharest Tribunal, after they saw that they had been arrested, statements that are still insincere. Contrary to what was argued by the defense of defendants T., he indicates as legal basis art.223, para.2 of the Criminal Procedure Code on which he bases the proposal for preventive arrest, considering that all evidence and defendants' statements prove a risk of evasion, of leaving the territory of Romania and he believes that art.223, para.1, letter a of the Criminal Procedure Code is not incident because this basis would be incident in the case in which preparations or attempts have already been made to leave the territory of Romania.
The fact that the defendant R. L.'s grandfather died does not justify the admission of her appeal, considering that, according to art. 99, para.1, letter e of Law 254/2013, persons under preventive arrest have the right to attend the funeral of close relatives under escort.
Nor do the medical conditions of defendant A. T., invoked by the defense, justify the admission of his appeal, because in the preventive detention section he receives all the medical care he needs.
It was claimed by the defendant A. T. that the case is related to his conversion to Islam. The case has nothing to do with Islam, it is only related to the criminal activities of the defendants. The Romanian authorities have not shown any disrespect for Islam, and the prosecutor, personally, also respects Islam.
In conclusion, considering the reasons presented, under art. 4251, para. 7, point 1, letter b of the Criminal Procedure Code, he requests the rejection of the four appeals as clearly unfounded.

Once they exceeded 1000 followers and could go live on Tik Tok, they invited followers to Instagram and from Instagram, they would go to Onlyfans, where followers paid a monthly subscription.
- According to A.S-A., N.G. used to tell them that they were incapable of making 30,000 – 40,000 euros per month, unlike the girls before them.
- A.S-A. also stated that the two houses in a particular neighborhood belonged to T.A. and T.T.
### Victim 4: P.C-D
- The person named P. C-D, who is a victim, testified during a criminal investigation.
- P. C-D got to know P. I in Timisoara in the winter of 2021 and later met her in Bucharest in the summer.
- P. I informed P. C-D that she was in a relationship with A. T, making significant money (€2000-€3000 per month) on OnlyFans, which she gave to A. T due to his investments in her, including dental and breast implant surgeries.
- P. I proposed P. C-D to do the same (i.e., work on OnlyFans) promising significant earnings and other benefits.
- P. C-D agreed to meet with brothers T. T and A. T. During the meeting, T. T introduced the idea of making money through OnlyFans, citing an example of a girl named Cora who earned up to $40,000 per month.
- P. C-D agreed to live with P. I and T. T. in their house for a week to learn the ropes and potentially move to her own apartment afterwards.
- P. C-D bought a Samsung phone on T. T.'s instruction, to manage her OnlyFans work.
- P. C-D started to live with P. I and others, including N. G. who instructed her about her work.
- N. G. set up P. C-D's OnlyFans account, took control, and started to select and post explicit content created by P. C-D.
- P. C-D, along with other girls, were directed by N. G. on the quantity and content of daily posts.
- P. C-D, P. I, and A.B. G. were doing similar work. P. C-D knew other girls were working for T. T. and A. T, but could not name them or their locations.
- From August to November 2021, P. C-D lived in a location where she couldn't leave without being accompanied by another girl, a rule set by N. G.
- P. C-D got a tattoo with the name of T. T. as a guarantee for a future breast enlargement surgery. Other girls working for T. T. and A. T. also had similar tattoos.
- P. C-D mentioned that she was part of a WhatsApp group where they discussed household chores and a Telegram group where they were given instructions about their TikTok and OnlyFans activities.
- In October 2021, P. C-D expressed her desire to leave due to lack of freedom and payment. T. T. and N. G. initially tried to dissuade her but later accused her of being a prostitute and demanded money for the expenses they had on her.
- Victim P. C-D was assaulted and forcefully evicted from her house by N. G., who was agitated and physical with her.
- The victim was left outside the house, minimally dressed, for about an hour before receiving clothes and her phone from A M A., who empathized with her situation.
- The other girls in the house witnessed the incident.
- P. C-D called her friend Victor for help. He suggested that she go to the police, which she did.
- The victim was initially told by a young, bearded policeman that she should make peace with her assailants.
- The same night, N. G. and R. A. L. came to the police station, bringing a bag of clothes and shoes for the victim. The victim's valuable items like her laptop, jewelry, and designer clothes were not returned.
- The victim later went with the police to recover her belongings, but R. A. L. refused to let them into the house without a search warrant.
- After the incident, N. G. accessed the victim's Facebook and WhatsApp accounts from the victim's laptop, sending messages and posting indecent pictures and videos of the victim.
- P. C-D had multiple conversations with N. G. and R. L., during which R. L. admitted that N. G. posted those pictures and videos. The victim then changed her password and removed all posts that weren't hers.
- Witness A S-A confirmed these events and described an incident where a girl known as C called the police claiming she was being held against her will.
- N. G. reacted violently to C's police call and threatened to harm C to the extent of disrupting her recent breast implant surgery.
- All the girls in the house were instructed by N. G. and R. L. to hide C's belongings in the attic.
- When the police arrived, N. G. and R. L. denied knowing C or having her living with them.
- The next day, N. G. and R. L. were summoned to the police.
- A S-A reported that R. L. frequently mentioned her past employment in the police to intimidate or reassure the girls in the house.
- After the departure of C., N.G. (the defendant), with help from A.B.G. and A.M.A., broke into C.'s accounts using her own laptop, as a form of revenge.
- N.G. and R.L. posted indecent photos and videos on C.'s accounts, threatening that the same would happen to anyone who left.
- The belongings of C. were moved to the house of T.T. and A.T., specifically into T.A.'s room.
- P.C-D., the injured party, has stated that she has not received any earnings from the OnlyFans platform, contrary to what N.G. and R.A.L. told her.
- According to P.C-D., she sent daily photos and videos to be posted on OnlyFans, but the card attached to the account wasn't hers; she suspects it belonged to G.
- The real beneficiaries of the OnlyFans earnings were T.T. and A.T., with N.G. once giving A.B.G. 3000 lei she earned from the platform.
- P.C-D. claimed that they all were promised a 50% share of the earnings from OnlyFans and TikTok, but no contracts were signed.
- P.C-D. has claimed that N.G. played a double role in manipulating the girls while working for T.T. and A.T., pretending to be helpful but maintaining close relationships with them.
- The defendants, T.T. and A.T., had several girlfriends at the same time, using this as a recruitment tactic. T.A. was in a relationship with P.I. and A.B.G. at the same time, sleeping with both.
- P.C-D. has claimed that T.T. and A.T. would maintain sexual relationships with the recruited girls, often asking them to participate in group sex.
- P.C-D. revealed that for platforms like OnlyFans and TikTok, they used American SIM cards and banned them for Romania through a VPN.

[09/02/2022, 00:59:40] A. U.: Web cam?
[09/02/2022, 00:59:45] Andrew: I've been doing this for a long time with a team of girls who were working on video chat. The company was fake.
[09/02/2022, 00:59:46] Andrew: Yes
[09/02/2022, 00:59:52] Andrew: But this is how I washed my dirty money
[09/02/2022, 00:59:55] Andrew: After that
[09/02/2022, 10:00:14] Andrew: Men started getting jealous and started asking me how they can start a video chat business. They will never do that because they are losers.
[09/02/2022, 01:00:17] Andrew: But they like the idea
[09/02/2022, 01:00:24] Andrew: So, I started charging men to 'teach' them
[09/02/2022, 01:00:31] Andrew: That's what those videos are about
[09/02/2022, 01:00:33] Andrew: It's all a cover

[09/02/2022, 01:02:09] Andrew: When I said earlier that I need a woman who I don't have to hide things from, this is what I was referring to

[02/03/2022, 04:25:12] A. U.: I feel a bit weird
[02/03/2022, 04:25:43] A. U.: and G said you'll probably come in 5 days???

[02/03/2022, 04:30:10] A. U.: what exactly do these girls do for work?
[02/03/2022, 04:32:12] A. U.: I thought I would come and we would be together, I understand things are happening but you need to talk to me and tell me, so I don't feel weird afterward
[02/03/2022, 07:07:56] Andrew: you shouldn't feel weird

[02/03/2022, 12:30:41] Andrew: and lingerie
[02/03/2022, 12:30:47] Andrew: and they have a live show on TikTok
[02/03/2022, 12:30:56] Andrew: which makes a lot of money
[02/03/2022, 12:32:00] A. U.: then why do they need to work for G.? They could do this on their own

[02/03/2022, 12:35:32] Andrew: not properly

[02/03/2022, 12:35:56] Andrew: those girls make a lot of money, it's not amateurish"
"[03/03/2022, 00:33:09] A. U.: I want to know why you brought me here, to this house. If you respected me, you would have asked me first if I'm okay with this. I thought I was coming here and living with you. It's a bit strange for me to have to stay with girls who work for you, especially since you had something with one of them. Yasmina. told me there was nothing between you two and that you take care of her like a "brother". I'm not stupid, I know there was something more. I could have stayed in London until you came back to Romania. I know you have a lot on your plate right now, but my sister tells me to go back to London because she thinks I'm not safe here, and I'm very confused. I want to know what your plan is.
[03/03/2022, 02:02:57] A. U.: I love you

_CONTEXT: While Andrew is saying here that he will never ask AU to do OnlyFans, he induces another victim to ask AU to take lewd photos for OnlyFans, the “bitch” referred to here is AU, this is consistent with his online courses where he says “YOU don’t do the selling, your bottom bitch does the selling, a girl has to hear it from a girl”, this is confirmation that his intention was or is to get AU to do sex work/onlyfans:_
_“[09/03/2022 14:47:08(UTC+2)] Andrew: Did you tell the bitch how much money you make?_
_[09/03/2022 14:59:36(UTC+2)] Andrew: Ask her to take pictures with you._
_[09/03/2022 14:59:50(UTC+2)] Iasmina: Okay._
_[09/03/2022 15:16:15(UTC+2)] Iasmina: So, me and her in the pictures?_
_[09/03/2022 15:16:32(UTC+2)] Andrew: Yes._
_[09/03/2022 17:02:57(UTC+2)] Iasmina: What kind of pictures?_
_[09/03/2022 17:03:20(UTC+2)] Andrew: Anything for OnlyFans._
_[09/03/2022 17:04:39(UTC+2)] Iasmina: In lingerie? She won't do it._
_[09/03/2022 17:05:20(UTC+2)] Andrew: We'll see.”_
_Additionally, Andrew says AU can keep all the money from Tiktok, but in reality she is still working for Georgiana and handing her at least 50% of the earnings, according to the witness statements from the file_
“[11/03/2022, 12:37:14] A. U.: Baby, why did G. ask me if I want to make a fake Tik Tok account?
[11/03/2022, 12:37:22] A. U.: I don't want to work for her
[11/03/2022, 12:45:42] Andrew: I don't understand
[11/03/2022, 12:45:43] Andrew: what?
[11/03/2022, 12:50:46] A. U.: yesterday she came home and asked me if I want to go live with B again and I told her I can go in for support, it's not like I would like this. Then she asked me if I have another phone with me, that she can make a fake TikTok account for me and I told her I have another phone, but it's just for calls, and she told me she has a good camera phone /And I was hmmmm, weird
[11/03/2022, 12:51:18] A. U.: I didn't tell her anything clear, I wanted to talk to you first
[11/03/2022, 12:51:38] A. U.: I don't like men talking to me and stuff
[11/03/2022, 12:52:43] Andrew: instead of going live with B, go live alone and keep all the money. I know you don't like men talking to you. /The truth is that I will be very busy with work often, so if you also had something to do it would be good, plus you will make a lot of money. /I will not let you have a normal job, where men see the real you. No way. On screen, I don't care. TikTok is better than in a nightclub, where men really try.”
“[14/03/2022, 17:39:14] Andrew: I have a 3-step plan
[14/03/2022, 17:39:20] A. U.: you know you can
[14/03/2022, 17:39:20] Andrew: and if you're my wife I want you to be involved
[14/03/2022, 17:39:23] A. U.: I trust you
[14/03/2022, 17:39:39] Andrew: you have to listen, think carefully and understand what I'm about to tell you
[14/03/2022, 17:39:52] Andrew: the plan is I want to get this house for free
[14/03/2022, 17:39:56] Andrew: For us. I'll show you.
[14/03/2022, 17:40:19] Andrew: https://www.imobiliare.ro/inchirieri-casevile/bucuresti/P./casa-de-inchiriat-6-carnere-X6ME11012\#rnodal-galerie-mare
[14/03/2022, 17:40:26] Andrew: look how we're going to do it
[14/03/2022, 17:41:02] Andrew: 1] start working with G. and work hard. Like the other girls trying to catch up. /You will make a lot of money and you keep all of it. to be rich. /But it is important for the girls to see you working, so they too will try harder to work.
[14/03/2022, 17:41:58] Andrew: 2] both girls are obsessed with you. G. just called me.. They like you a lot. /So we'll fuck them together. We'll do a threesome and we'll fuck them, make them love you as their girlfriend. /We fuck as a team.
[14/03/2022, 17:42:18] Andrew: I'll tell you the 3rd part in person
[14/03/2022, 17:43:03] A. U.: and what does this have to do with the house?
[14/03/2022, 17:43:23] Andrew: earn a lot of money and they will buy it through G.'s company, from their salaries.
[14/03/2022, 17:44:14] A. U.: so is the house for me or for the girls?
[14/03/2022, 17:44:21] Andrew: actually, it's for me
[14/03/2022, 17:44:29] Andrew: but that means us. Because you're my wife forever. Don't ruin it
[14/03/2022, 17:44:31] A. U.: I meant me and you
[14/03/2022, 17:44:36] Andrew: you keep all the money
[14/03/2022, 17:44:44] Andrew: they buy the house. Can I trust you with this?
[14/03/2022, 18:12:29] A. U.: when you said to work with G., did you mean TikTok or also onlyfans
[14/03/2022, 18:14:28] Andrew: ONLY TikTok
[14/03/2022, 18:15:30] A. U.: and after that will you ask me to do that too? I've heard stories about A. /They didn't sound too good
[14/03/2022, 18:15:38] Andrew: I didn't care about that whore
[14/03/2022, 18:15:45] Andrew: I will never ask you to do OF
[14/03/2022, 18:15:46] Andrew: never
[14/03/2022, 18:15:58] A. U.: and does that mean I will stay in this house for more than 2 weeks?
[14/03/2022, 18:16:03] Andrew: you can do TikTok and we'll fuck a few girls together and you help me with my businesses
[14/03/2022, 18:16:16] Andrew: OF only if YOU want to do it /I will never ask you.”
“[04/04/2022, 15:59:44] Andrew: we talked a bit. I need you on my team to do what G. tells you
[04/04/2022, 15:59:.....] Andrew: we'll talk more later
[04/04/2022, 16:01:32] A. U.: is this how our relationship will be? Or is it just like this now
[04/04/2022, 16:03:36] Andrew: you're starting to complain
[04/04/2022, 16:03:41] Andrew: like I don't have enough stress
[08/04/2022, 14:23:14] Andrew: G. is super excited about you
[08/04/2022, 14:23:15] Andrew: you work hard
[08/04/2022, 14:23:55] A. U.: I've been working almost 8 hours without a break
[08/04/2022, 14:25:23] Andrew: you'll be rich ♥”
TRANSCRIPTS PART 9
[07/02/2022 18:15:37(UTC+0)] Luana: Don't start as well.
[07/02/2022 18:15:44(UTC+0)] Beatrice: No, I said I'll change. I wasn't complaining here, but instead of staying here, I'd better make videos for OnlyFans since I haven't done them for a while.
[07/02/2022 18:15:57(UTC+0)] Beatrice: Actually, however you want.
[07/02/2022 18:16:11(UTC+0)] Beatrice: I can also go live, it's not difficult for me.
[07/02/2022 18:17:06(UTC+0)] Georgiana: For OnlyFans, you already have videos for now, you can do those tomorrow instead.
[07/02/2022 18:17:13(UTC+0)] Luana: I don't mind if you don't go live. I can share the money with G and T from the aviation, and I won't involve you in the equation anymore.
[07/02/2022 18:17:27(UTC+0)] Luana: Because I don't like giving you 50% either.
[07/02/2022 18:17:40(UTC+0)] Luana: Those 10k since December are only from him.
[07/02/2022 18:18:17(UTC+0)] Luana: From which I took 1500, and G might take 20%, T 25%, and I'll take the rest.
[07/02/2022 18:19:44(UTC+0)] Beatrice: I was just asking what's better, so you don't argue with me for spending 7 hours for $20 when I could have made videos instead.
[23/01/2022 11:09:09(UTC+0)] Luana: You're pushing yourself today because it's Sunday and it's going well.
[23/01/2022 11:09:14(UTC+0)] Luana: Go make yourself a coffee.
[23/01/2022 11:09:21(UTC+0)] Beatrice: Okay.
[23/01/2022 11:09:22(UTC+0)] Luana: Save the video and photos for during the week.
[23/01/2022 11:09:35(UTC+0)] Luana: I'll tell G that I told you.
[16/10/2021 02:19:40(UTC+0)] C: What do I have to do?
[16/10/2021 02:19:54(UTC+0)] Georgiana: So, a 2-minute video where instead of using a dildo, you use a shirt or something (like how you did it with the pants), and also tied at the back with handcuffs and a gag.
[07/01/2022 18:53:44(UTC+0)] Luana: After everyone finishes creating a new TikTok account and posting on it, do whatever else you need to do.
[07/01/2022 18:53:54(UTC+0)] Luana: You're free tonight to sleep. Don't waste time.
[07/01/2022 18:54:11(UTC+0)] Luana: So you can be well-rested for tomorrow, Saturday.
[07/01/2022 18:54:20(UTC+0)] Luana: "And Sunday for the weekend. (signed G & L)"
[24/03/2022 00:55:06(UTC+2)] Georgiana: Are you going live tonight?
[24/03/2022 01:03:26(UTC+2)] Iasmina: I want to take pictures, so I'm not 100% sure.
[24/03/2022 01:03:35(UTC+2)] Georgiana: Okay.
[24/03/2022 01:08:18(UTC+2)] Georgiana: So, there's no question of making up for it.
[24/03/2022 01:08:35(UTC+2)] Iasmina: What do you mean?
[24/03/2022 01:08:53(UTC+2)] Iasmina: But I didn't say I won't go live today at all.
[24/03/2022 01:08:54(UTC+2)] Georgiana: Well, how much did you have left to make up until now?
[24/03/2022 01:09:54(UTC+2)] Georgiana: Don't give me excuses. You haven't done anything today. Do you feel like you're swallowing excuses? If I hadn't told you, you wouldn't have even brought up the subject.
[09/03/2022 14:47:08(UTC+2)] Andrew: Did you tell the bitch how much money you make?
[09/03/2022 14:59:36(UTC+2)] Andrew: Ask her to take pictures with you.
[09/03/2022 14:59:50(UTC+2)] Iasmina: Okay.
[09/03/2022 15:16:15(UTC+2)] Iasmina: So, me and her in the pictures?
[09/03/2022 15:16:32(UTC+2)] Andrew: Yes.
[09/03/2022 17:02:57(UTC+2)] Iasmina: What kind of pictures?
[09/03/2022 17:03:20(UTC+2)] Andrew: Anything for OnlyFans.
[09/03/2022 17:04:39(UTC+2)] Iasmina: In lingerie? She won't do it.
[09/03/2022 17:05:20(UTC+2)] Andrew: We'll see.
[10/04/2022 01:08:13(UTC+3)] Andrew: And with T's new girl, you're doing a great job.
[10/04/2022 01:08:21(UTC+3)] Andrew: T wants you to bring her back and for her to stay there.
[10/04/2022 01:08:30(UTC+3)] Andrew: Tomorrow, I'll take care of B and U. We need to be alone and find a solution for this.
[19/02/2022 18:25:49(UTC+2)] Iasmina: Does she know about OnlyFans?
[19/02/2022 18:29:38(UTC+2)] Tristan: No.
[19/02/2022 18:29:46(UTC+2)] Tristan: And she's studying to become a lawyer, she doesn't care.
[19/02/2022 18:29:49(UTC+2)] Iasmina: I know. She asked me to show her my TikTok, and I wasn't sure.
[19/02/2022 18:30:15(UTC+2)] Iasmina: Heyy. Sefora just messaged me that she's in Bucharest and asked me to come to her at the hotel, just for a bit.
[05/03/2022 21:36:12(UTC+2)] Tristan: Go.
[05/03/2022 21:36:57(UTC+2)] Tristan: Get some information from her.
[05/03/2022 21:37:07(UTC+2)] Tristan: For me.
[05/03/2022 21:37:08(UTC+2)] Iasmina: But I haven't finished my live hours on TikTok.
[05/03/2022 21:37:19(UTC+2)] Iasmina: I did well financially, I only have 4 more hours of live. You decide.
[10/03/2022 09:37:45(UTC+2)] Iasmina: Yes, and then I'm the one who's blamed for not making money even though you work hard for us.
[12/03/2022 23:26:57(UTC+2)] Luana: We split on OnlyFans.
[12/03/2022 23:27:06(UTC+2)] Luana: G takes O.
[12/03/2022 23:27:08(UTC+2)] Luana: I take you.
[12/03/2022 23:27:13(UTC+2)] Luana: Maybe you don't listen, I'll kill you if we don't make money.
[12/03/2022 23:27:18(UTC+2)] Luana: If we don't make money.
[07/03/2022 18:13:35(UTC+2)] Georgiana: I'll punch you in the mouth until I arrive, and then I'll give you another 10, you lazy incurable bastard.
[07/03/2022 18:13:46(UTC+2)] Georgiana: I'll tear you apart when I get there.
[07/03/2022 18:13:53(UTC+2)] Iasmina: What did I do?
[07/03/2022 18:14:04(UTC+2)] Georgiana: You have an hour and 10 minutes to disappear.
[07/03/2022 18:14:07(UTC+2)] Georgiana: Disappear.
[07/03/2022 18:14:27(UTC+2)] Iasmina: But what did I do?
[07/03/2022 18:15:49(UTC+2)] Georgiana: It's more like what you didn't do yesterday for an hour.
[30/03/2022 02:55:30(UTC+3)] Georgiana: You have a 20% deduction, it's been 4 days since you last posted.
[30/03/2022 02:55:34(UTC+3)] Luana: I'm waiting for yesterday's money.
[30/03/2022 03:39:01(UTC+3)] Georgiana: IF ANDREW LOOKS TO SEE IF YOU POSTED TIKTOKS, YOU WON'T EVEN HAVE TIME TO PACK. I GUARANTEE YOU'LL FLY FROM THE BALCONY DIRECTLY.

[29/03/2022, 13:20:22] Andrew: Tristan and Georgiana are.
[29/03/2022, 13:20:25] Andrew: But I'm the one leading them.

TRANSCRIPTS PART 12
[10/03/2022, 13:56:22] Andrew: Kiss the girls and send me a video. Do something hot and fun. I'm bored and alone on the plane.
[10/03/2022, 13:58:46] A. U.: Everyone is still sleeping, and I can't do that, baby. I'm not like that.
[10/03/2022, 13:59:21] Andrew: "Andrew said he wants a video with my pussy on your face."
[10/03/2022, 14:02:04] A. U.: I'm not going to do that.
[10/03/2022, 14:02:10] A. U.: You mean with all the girls?
[10/03/2022, 14:02:18] Andrew: ...and...
[10/03/2022, 14:02:20] Andrew: Don't be boring.
[10/03/2022, 14:02:55] A. U.: Are you serious?
[10/03/2022, 14:08:10] A. U.: It's not that I'm boring. But it's one thing to ask me, and another to ask all the girls.
[10/03/2022, 14:08:50] A. U.: Why do you want to see the girls?
[10/03/2022, 14:09:10] Andrew: I want to see that YOU submit to me. It's not about them. It's about knowing that my woman does whatever I tell her.
[10/03/2022, 14:09:29] Andrew: I know you don't want to. That's why it means something when you want to.
[10/03/2022, 14:09:37] Andrew: So submit to your man. We're together forever, it's like a picture, damn it.
[10/03/2022, 15:01:15] A. U.: Okay. I'll do it. I want to make you happy.
[10/03/2022, 15:02:07] Andrew: You're starting to understand.
[10/03/2022, 15:02:25] Andrew: A woman who always submits and does what I say, especially things she doesn't usually do, is a woman who is truly loyal to her man.
[10/03/2022, 15:02:31] Andrew: I want the best woman on the planet.
[10/03/2022, 15:02:33] Andrew: ♥ ♥ ♥
[10/03/2022, 15:07:14] A. U.: You know I'm loyal to you. And yes, I don't usually do this, but I want to make you happy, and I hope you see how important you are to me. ♥ ♥
[10/03/2022, 15:09:15] Andrew: That's exactly what you're showing me.
[10/03/2022, 15:09:18] Andrew: Plus, it's sexy.
[10/03/2022, 15:09:27] Andrew: I can't explain how much I like it when you submit to me without asking questions.
[10/03/2022, 15:09:29] Andrew: It's exciting.
[10/03/2022, 15:25:39] A. U.: I only take pictures with B, because Jasmine just woke up and she was like, "Do we really have to do it now?" It will take too long.
...
[10/03/2022, 16:40:11] Andrew: The pictures are amazing.
[10/03/2022, 16:40:13] Andrew: I'm proud of you.
[10/03/2022, 16:40:15] Andrew: You .
[10/03/2022, 16:40:18] Andrew: Well done, baby.
[10/03/2022, 16:40:37] A. U.: Thank you, baby 😊 ♥
[10/03/2022, 16:40:42] A. U.: Okay?
[10/03/2022, 16:40:58] Andrew: Sure.
[10/03/2022, 16:44:23] Andrew: Now I really miss you.
[10/03/2022, 16:44:28] Andrew: You should try to submit to me more often.
[10/03/2022, 16:44:31] Andrew: ALWAYS LISTEN.
[10/03/2022, 16:54:34] A. U.: And I miss you too, baby.
[10/03/2022, 16:54:36] A. U.: A lot.
[10/03/2022, 16:55:10] A. U.: And what if I don't submit?
[10/03/2022, 16:55:23] Andrew: You will submit because that's how you get my attention and love.
[10/03/2022, 16:55:32] Andrew: And punishment comes from love.
TRANSCRIPTS PART 13
[N/A] Andrew Tate: You need a tattoo of my name or a big slap
[N/A] Girl: No tattoos, baby, I hate tattoos. They look cool on others, but not on me.
[N/A] Andrew Tate: If I told you to put my name in a tattoo, you would do it, so you better hope I don't want that, and I don't want it yet.
[N/A] Girl: So you don't want what I want?
[N/A] Andrew Tate: You want what I want!
[N/A] Girl: Then it's good that you don't want me to get a tattoo.
[N/A] Andrew Tate: Not yet. It would be important to me, but I need to see that you deserve it first.
...
[N/A] Girl: How many girls already have your name?
[N/A] Andrew Tate: Two.
[N/A] Girl: I think we should focus more on our relationship than external things.
[N/A] Andrew Tate: You will write something else, something nice.
[N/A] Girl: I want to remain pure.
[N/A] Andrew Tate: Pure women submit to their men.
...
[N/A] Andrew Tate: Where is my dinner?
[N/A] Girl: Baby, don't talk like that, please. You know I want to make you dinner, just wait until I get to you.
[N/A] Andrew Tate: SLAVE!
[N/A] Girl: Please.
...
[N/A] Andrew Tate: BELT!
[N/A] Girl: Do you want me to be your slave or your wife?
[N/A] Andrew Tate: You will do whatever I tell you, which is the same thing. If I choose a woman to be my wife, she will love me enough to let me do as I please. I will decide if she is a slave. She doesn't make the rules; I am the man. I don't listen to complaints from women. Just trust me and shut up, don't annoy me again today! It doesn't matter if I call you a slave; what matters is that I can do it if I want to without you being stupid. There are enough stupid women. If I want to choose, I have 10,000 options to choose from.

## Pertinent quotes from judges in the case
“In assessing the maintenance of the concrete danger for public order that the investigation of the defendants at large would present at this stage of the procedure, it is necessary to have in mind given the particularities of the present case, namely: the nature and seriousness of the acts alleged to have been committed by the defendants.
This is related to: the well-structured nature of the group in question, each member having a clearly established role; the diversity and multiplicity
of material evidence in the case of each crime; their transnational character; the long time span in which they were executed; the large number of victims, the consequences produced consisting of the damages caused to each injured person mentioned in the factual situation, by committing the crimes of rape and human trafficking; the sums of money obtained from such serious crimes; the
fact that the defendants showed criminal persistence by committing the alleged acts, the judge of rights and liberties thus appreciates that the investigation in a state of freedom or by ordering a less intrusive restrictive measure (judicial control), without custodial character would be able to induce at the level of the defendants' perception, the idea of a form of justified conduct, which would lead to the possibility of their new involvement in committing similar acts.”

“Thus, the judge of rights and liberties finds that in the case, with regard to the two defendants .... and ... the conditions provided by art. 223 para. 1 lit. a, b and c and para. 2 C.proc.pen., since from the evidence administered up to this point, in the case there are enough elements to convince an objective observer that it is possible that the defendants have committed the acts for which they are being investigated and the defendants present a concrete danger to public order , there are also data
that he would have made preparations to evade the criminal investigation by leaving Romania, that he
would have tried to influence the witnesses and exert pressure on the injured persons.”

## Evidence and Preventive Measures in the Romanian System
The standard of evidence for all preventive measures in the Romanian legal system, including house arrest or judicial control, is "reasonable suspicion" (suspiciunea rezonabilă in Romanian).
"Reasonable suspicion" is a lower standard of evidence compared to the standard of "beyond a reasonable doubt" required for a conviction in a criminal trial. It is a standard used to determine whether there are sufficient grounds to suspect a person of committing a crime and to justify the imposition of preventive measures.
When deciding whether to grant house arrest or judicial control, the court assesses the specific circumstances of the case, including the seriousness of the charges, the defendant's criminal record, the likelihood of flight or obstruction of justice, and other relevant factors. The court evaluates whether there is reasonable suspicion that the defendant committed the alleged offense and determines if the proposed preventive measures are necessary and proportionate.
Therefore, the decision to grant house arrest or judicial control is not based on the strength or weakness of the evidence, but rather on whether there is reasonable suspicion that the defendant committed the offense and whether the specific conditions for the alternative measures are met.
- The Tates do not have past criminal convictions and have social ties in Romania so are more likely to be granted leniency in preventive measures, particularly after a long period of time under harsher preventive measures such as pre-trial arrest or house arrest as in Romanian law “social danger” from alleged crimes “fades over time”.
## ASA/PCD WITNESS STATEMENTS FULL
Regarding the aforementioned A.S.A., she was questioned in the case as a witness on October 31, 2022. The witness stated that she arrived in Bucharest in July 2021 to work at a casino in the hotel .... She declared that during this period, she approached the defendant T.T. on Instagram, telling him "not to show off on social media anymore." Later, she continued the discussions on Instagram with him, and he repeatedly invited her to go out together.
A.S.A. stated that she initially didn't accept, but eventually gave in to the insistence of T.T. and agreed to meet him. Their first meeting was at a cafe in the Nordului area, where the defendant T.T. was accompanied by his brother, the defendant T.A., and his girlfriend, Vivien, whom A.S.A. claimed to have limited knowledge about, but knew that she worked in video chat and had a cobra tattoo on one of her legs. She also knew that Vivien was from Prague, but she didn't know her citizenship.
Furthermore, A.S.A. stated that after several meetings with the defendant T.T. and after starting a romantic relationship with him, he repeatedly proposed that she quit her job and move into a house where several girls lived, telling her that she didn't need to work anymore and that everything would be fine for both of them. A.S.A. claimed that she didn't accept the proposal at first, but she frequently visited .... in ..... and occasionally spent evenings there. During the visits, I (referred to as P.Y., note) always showed her TikTok videos, saying that it was very fun and that they could earn a lot of money. A.S.A. didn't receive many details about OnlyFans from I and the other girls at first, but she knew that both I and BV (referred to as P.Y. and A.B.G., note) made videos for OnlyFans.
According to A.S.A.'s statement, the defendants T.T. and A.T. possessed guns and swords, which also made her feel fearful.
She stated that the whole situation with C. (the victim P.C.-D) made her realize that there was no escape, and she was also afraid of Eli and G. (the defendants N.G. and R.A.L.).
According to A.S.A.'s statement, in the first week, things were quite relaxed regarding activities on TikTok. She agreed to engage in those activities at the insistence of P.Y., who told her that by doing what she was told, she would show her love for the defendant T.T. and that he would like her more. After a week, the attitudes of the defendants N.G.M. and R.L. changed, forcing her to work more and more, post more and more video clips on TikTok, and follow their instructions regarding photos and video clips for OnlyFans.
A.S.A. stated that she took photos and made videos for OnlyFans at the instructions of N.G. and R.L., and the latter was responsible for posting them on OnlyFans and other platforms. Moreover, a very strict schedule was imposed, where she had to go live on TikTok for 12 hours, with only a 5-minute break. For every deviation from the schedule, 10% of the earnings were deducted. She also mentioned that the defendants N.G. and R.L. had set a minimum goal of earning 10,000 euros per month from TikTok.
Furthermore, A.S.A. stated that around January, A.B.G. created a Revolut and Paypal account for her to receive money from TikTok. Before that moment, her TikTok accounts were associated with A.B.G.'s Paypal account. Regarding the amounts of money earned on TikTok, they were deposited into her Paypal account and the Paypal accounts of P.Y., A.B.G., and A.M.A., alias "....," and then transferred to Revolut. At the end of the month, a meeting was held with N.G., who had a notebook with names and amounts of money obtained, and that's how the money was divided.
According to A.S.A.'s statement, the defendants N.G. and R.A.L. had the passwords for all their accounts and checked how much money they made each day. After calculations were made, A.S.A. would transfer 50% of the TikTok earnings to N.G. on Revolut for that month. Sometimes, for deviations, such as not logging in at the appointed time by N.G., staying longer on a break, crying during a live session, or wiping their noses during a live session, different percentages were deducted, approximately 10% for each deviation. Considering these deviations, she usually received much less than half of the total earnings.
Regarding OnlyFans, A.S.A. stated that she and the other girls didn't have access to the accounts, only the defendants N.G. and R.A.L. did, and they would tell them what videos and photos to make, and they would post them. At the end of the month, the defendants N.G. and R.A.L. would inform them how much money they made on OnlyFans and give them their share in cash. A.S.A. stated that she and P.Y. received the money in hand, but she doesn't know how A.B.G. received her share. She also mentioned that she had no way of knowing how much money she earned on OnlyFans, and it's possible that she made much more than what N.G. and R.A.L. claimed. On TikTok, she earned approximately 5,000 euros each month, and her share on OnlyFans was around 300-400 euros, but she didn't know the exact amount of the remaining money.
She also mentioned that the defendants N.G. and R.A.L. constantly told them that the other girls made around 40,000 euros on OnlyFans and that they were weak in this regard. Additionally, the defendants N.G. and R.A.L. stated that only the important girls stayed in the house in .... because it was closer to the T. brothers' house and that they should make the most money.
According to the statement of the named A.S.A., there are other houses or apartments where certain girls do the same thing, but she couldn't specify the locations. She mentioned knowing a girl named Abigail who also does video chat for the defendant T.T., and she even has a child with him. She also knows several girls who work for the defendants T.T. and A.T., as follows: Carmen Andreea, who has TikTok accounts - Anneese1, anneereysx, Miss_sims - both of them worked for T.. She knows that a blonde girl works for the defendant T.A., whom she saw at their house and knows from A.B.G. that she is 17 years old.
Furthermore, A.S.A. declared that during the time she lived there, she was part of a WhatsApp group called "Suspicious Death," where they discussed both work schedules and other things in the house. The group included the defendants N.G. and R.L., as well as the named P.Y., A.B.G., A.M.A., known as "..." and Lexa.
A.S.A. stated that she was afraid of the defendant N.G. and had become closer to the defendant R.L., who always gave her advice on how to talk to the defendant T.T. to please him. She knew that the defendant N.G. also advised A.B.G. on how to behave with the defendant T.A. R.L. behaved normally, but N.G. was stricter with them, although she never physically assaulted her. However, both R.L. and N.G. verbally abused and threatened them if they didn't do their job.
In the continuation of the statement, A.S.A. mentioned that at one point, she told A.B.G. that she wanted to quit what she was doing, but A.B.G. told N.G. and R.L. about it. She stated that the two became very angry, wanted to kick her out of the house, and told the defendant T.T. about it. He, in turn, got upset, sent her a message telling her to listen to the girls, and said she couldn't quit OnlyFans until he came home. When the defendant T.T. arrived home, a meeting was held at the house of the defendants T.T. and A.T., attended by the defendants T.T. and A.T., the defendants N.G. and R.A.L., and the named A.S.A., P.Y., and A.B.G. In that meeting, the defendant N.G. gave A.S.A. a last chance, even though she wanted to quit. She was somewhat compelled by the defendant T.T. not to quit, as she was the only girl in the house of the defendant T.T., and all the others were kicked out. She also mentioned that after the meeting, the defendant T.T. told her that another girl would come to the house to do OnlyFans.
A.S.A. stated that throughout the period she lived there, she considered herself to be in a love relationship with T.T., and they even had sexual relations a few times.
A.S.A. further related that since she found out her father had serious health problems, she told all the girls in the house, including N.G., that she wanted to go home and quit OnlyFans and everything she was doing there. However, N.G. insisted, saying she would help her with money for her father, as long as she didn't quit. Slowly, she distanced herself from them, and on N.G.'s birthday, during the party organized at the house of the defendants T.T. and A.T., taking advantage of N.G.'s happy state, she told them that she wanted to leave for good. The defendants N.G. and R.A.L. informed T.T., who didn't react that evening. After the party, the defendant T.T. sent her a message and called her to discuss. So she went to the defendant T.T.'s house, where he treated her nicely and tried to convince her not to quit, thinking that they might eventually involve the police, being afraid after the incident involving C.
A.S.A. stated that she left the girls' house, packed her bags, and informed the defendant N.G. because BV and Ştrumfi told her that she couldn't leave until she gave G. her share of the money, and N.G. came and clarified the situation regarding the sums of money. Also, N.G. told the other girls present that she would return to them alone.
A.S.A. also mentioned that, at the insistence of P.I. and T.T., she tattooed T.T.'s name, "Talisman T.," on her collarbone.
A.S.A. specified that she believes she was manipulated throughout the whole period. She wasn't allowed to leave the house without informing N.G., the girls, and T.T. She couldn't go out alone; she was always accompanied by A.B.G. or P.I.
A.S.A. claimed that she couldn't quit earlier because she was afraid that the defendants N.G. and R.L. would post pictures or videos of her, as they did in C's case. Moreover, she was afraid of what her parents would say if they found out.
A.S.A. also declared that she lived in the brothers' house from October 28, 2021, until February 27, 2022. She never paid any rent. She earned approximately 5,000 euros per month but received around 1,500 euros, which she used to buy clothes to use for making money. Furthermore, according to A.S.A.'s statement, the defendant A.T. was the head and the boss in the house. He supervised the activities of the defendants T.T., ..........., and BV. A.T. also coordinated the activities of the defendant N.G., who was his personal assistant and in a subordinate relationship. If the defendant A.T. told N.G. something, she had to do it. N.G. was responsible for coordinating the other people, including the girls who posted pictures on the internet, as well as other people who engaged in activities at the house. N.G. handled the activities on the OnlyFans website. She managed the passwords and accounts. N.G. was more involved with the defendant T.A. and coordinated Eli's activities (the defendant R.A.L.), who was more involved with the defendant T.T. R.L. was in charge of managing the Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter accounts. N.G. had no relationship with A.T. R.A.L. had no relationship with T.T. She joined the brothers' activities shortly before she came to the house.
According to A.S.A.'s statement, the named A.B.G., known as "BV," is the girlfriend of the named T.A. She did what she did, but she didn't have the role of managing accounts or distributing the money. She also stated that the named P.I. is the girlfriend of the named T.A. She did what she did, but she didn't have the role of managing accounts or distributing the money. A.S.A. claimed that P.I., at the instigation of T.T., persuaded her to record and post pictures with her. She also mentioned that the defendants T.T. and A.T. knew everything that was happening with them, and she was convinced that the money they earned ended up with them.
Regarding the mechanism of obtaining money from TikTok, A.S.A. stated that it involved various people paying for the posts they made. They needed to have 1,000 followers on TikTok to go live and earn money. This requirement was necessary because many of the accounts were assumed to be bots. Once they passed the 1,000 followers threshold and could go live on TikTok, they invited the followers to Instagram, and from Instagram, they went to OnlyFans, where followers paid a monthly subscription.
According to A.S.A.'s statement, N.G. would tell them that they couldn't make 30,000 to 40,000 euros per month like the girls before them.
A.S.A. also mentioned that the two houses in the ..... neighborhood in ..... belong to the named T.A. and T.T. P. also lives there.
During the criminal investigation, the named P.C-D, who identified herself as the victim, was also heard. She declared that in the winter of 2021, she met the named P.I. while she was in Timisoara, as they were in the same group of friends. In the summer of 2021, she came to Bucharest and met P.I. again. On that occasion, P.I. told her that she was in a relationship with the defendant A.T. and that she was very happy. She also told her that she was doing OnlyFans and earning large sums of money, around 2,000-3,000 euros per month. P.I. told her that she gave the money she earned from OnlyFans to the named T.A. because he had invested in her, such as getting dental work and breast implants.
The victim further stated that during the conversation, P.I. proposed to her to do the same thing, meaning OnlyFans, saying that she would earn a lot of money, and if the defendants T.T. and A.T. saw her working, they would offer her vacations and other rewards. The victim agreed to P.I.'s proposal and arranged to meet the T. brothers the next day. So, the next day, the victim went to their house in ....., where P.I. was waiting for her. There, she introduced her to the T.T. brothers, and she started talking to the defendant T.T., who told her that she would earn a lot of money and that they had many other girls working for them, doing OnlyFans and earning large sums of money. At that moment, the defendant T.T. gave the example of a girl named Cora, who allegedly earned even $40,000 per month. Additionally, the defendant T.T. proposed that she stay in the same house where P.I. lived for a week to learn what she needed to do. If she did well, they would provide her with an apartment paid for by them, where she could live alone.
According to the victim P.C-D's statement, she agreed with the defendant T.T., who told P.I. to discuss with the defendant N.G. to buy her a Samsung phone to work with. The next day, she moved into the house with P.I., where A.M.A., known as Ştrumfi, and A.B.G. were also living. On the same day, the defendant N.G. came to the house and explained to her again what she needed to do. The victim P.C-D went with N.G. and A.B.G. to Mall Băneasa, where N.G. bought her a Samsung mobile phone. After they returned home, the defendant N.G. told Iasmina (the victim) to help her create multiple TikTok accounts, which they did. The victim also mentioned that on that same day, she created an account on the OnlyFans platform, but the password was later changed by N.G., so she couldn't access that account anymore. The pictures for the OnlyFans account were taken by P.I. and A.M.A. They were pictures or videos in which she appeared in lingerie or nude, in pornographic poses, sometimes even using sex toys. The victim stated that she would send these photos and videos to the defendant N.G., who would select and post them on the OnlyFans platform. The victim mentioned that N.G. was the one who told everyone how many photos or videos they had to make daily and what the content should be. She mentioned having a schedule set by N.G. and a set number of hours spent live on TikTok.
In this regard, the discussions on the WhatsApp application between the victim and the defendant N.G. were considered relevant.
Furthermore, the victim stated that the named P.I. and A.B.G. did the same thing as her. There were also other girls who did the same for the defendants T.T. and A.T., but she couldn't specify their names or locations. She mentioned a girl named Cora from Constanța or Pitești, a girl who used the Instagram account Carmen Andreea00, and a girl nicknamed Draxsan from Timișoara.
The victim, P.C-D, declared that she did these things from August 2021 until November of the same year and during this entire period, she lived at the location in ...... She mentioned that she couldn't leave the location unless accompanied by one of the girls, a rule established by the defendant N.G.
The victim also related that the defendant N.G. informed her that the defendant T.T. asked her to get a tattoo with his name as a guarantee for a future breast enlargement surgery. She agreed, and the next day she got a tattoo in the rib area with the following message: "T.'s Girl." Before that, the defendant T.T. also told her that he would be very happy if she got such a tattoo, and it would mean that the victim cared about him and respected him. The victim also mentioned that the other girls who worked for the defendants T.T. and A.T. had tattoos either with the name of the named T.A., the name of the named T.T., or with a cobra, considering that the defendant T.A. is known by the nickname Cobra T., and the defendant T.T. by the nickname Talisman T.
It was found that this circumstance is confirmed by the conversation with the defendant N.G. M
In continuation of the statement, the victim P. C-D stated that approximately one month later, a meeting was held at the home of the T. brothers, attended by all the girls in the house, Carmen, the accused N. G., and the accused T. T. and A. T., during which a girl named Elli (the accused R. A. L., also known as R. L.) was introduced to her. During this meeting, they discussed marketing and how they would promote on TikTok. The accused R. A. L. handed her a Samsung phone on which there were two TikTok accounts belonging to her and told her to replace her photos and videos with hers and to change the names, claiming that those accounts had many followers.
At first, it seemed like E. (the accused R. L.) was asking for the approval of a certain N. G. in everything and was subordinate to her, but later, things changed, and both of them were equally involved. It was established that E. would take care of a person named P. I and Carmen, while N. G. would take care of her and Cora. However, E. still checked their TikTok accounts and guided them on what type of content to post.
According to the statement of the victim P. C-D, she was part of a WhatsApp group called "Moarte suspectă" ("Suspicious Death") along with the accused N. G., a person named P. I, A. M. A., and A. B. G., where they discussed household matters. Regarding the necessary purchases, they discussed them in the group, and on weekends, they went shopping together with the accused N. G., who always paid for the purchases using bank cards issued in the names of T. T. and A. T.
There was also another group on the Telegram app that included all the girls who worked for the accused T. T. and A. T., as well as the accused N. G. and R. A. L., where they were given instructions on what needed to be done on TikTok and OnlyFans. The victim P. C-D claimed that everything she posted had to be initially checked and approved by the accused R. L. and N. G.
Continuing her statement, the victim P. C-D declared that at the end of October 2021, due to the deteriorating relationship with the accused N. G., who did not have time and did not receive money for what she was doing, she told her that she wanted to quit and leave that house. The accused N. G. recommended her to talk to the accused T. T. about this, which she did. To make her change her mind about leaving, the accused T. T. proposed that she move in with him. She discussed this with the accused N. G., but she disagreed. The victim P. C-D further stated that the accused N. G. talked to the accused T. T., and later he accused the victim P. C-D of being a prostitute and told her she could leave. When they realized that she really wanted to leave, the accused T. T. and N. G. demanded various amounts of money from her, representing the expenses they had with her. Initially, the accused T. T. and N. G. asked for 2000 euros, then 5000 euros, blackmailing her with these sums of money to prevent her from leaving.
The victim P. C-D stated that on October 28, 2021, while she was packing her clothes, the accused R. L. came to her and asked her to go down to the kitchen where the individuals A. M. A., P. I, A. B. G., and the accused N. G. were present, as well as a newly arrived girl named A. (A. S. A.). The victim P. C-D mentioned that she sat at the table and initiated a discussion about her departure. At that moment, the accused R. A. L. and N. G. told her that she could only leave after repaying the money spent on breast implants, and the accused R. A. L. demanded the sum of 2000 euros for the time she spent with her. The discussion escalated, and the accused R. L. and N. G. started yelling at her, causing her to cry and tell them that she would go to the police. At that moment, the accused R. A. L. told her that she had connections in the police and the DIICOT (Directorate for Investigating Organized Crime and Terrorism) and that nothing could happen to them because she had previously worked in the Gendarmerie.
According to the statement of the victim P. C-D, she went to her room to pack her luggage when the accused N. G., very angry, entered and put her hand around her throat, pushing her under a desk, saying, "Where do you think you're going?" Additionally, the accused N. G. grabbed her hand and dragged her out of the house, where she stayed for about an hour, dressed scantily. At one point, A. M. A., crying, came to her with some clothes and her personal phone, saying she felt sorry for her. All the other girls in the house witnessed these scenes. Given the situation she was in, the victim called a friend named Victor, whom she told what had happened and asked for help. She went to his house to get some money and the keys to an apartment, and during that time, Victor advised her to go to the police, which she did. Later, she went to the police station in [city name] where she filed a complaint, and the next day when she went to the police for questioning, she was met by a young bearded police officer who recommended that she reconcile with them, saying he knew the accused R. A. L. because they were colleagues, and he would summon them to the police station. In the evening, at the [city name] Police Station, G. and E. also appeared and she noticed that they were talking to the same police officer. She asked for explanations about what was happening, and the police officer told her that the two had gone to get her things. After some time, the accused R. A. L. and N. G. returned to the police station with a bag containing very few clothes and shoes, which they defiantly threw in front of her. Her valuable belongings, including her laptop, jewelry, cards, and branded clothing, were not returned. Seeing this, she went with the police officers from [city name] to [city name] where she lived to retrieve her other belongings, and on that occasion, the accused R. A. L. came to the door and said that without a warrant, they couldn't enter the house, and she couldn't prove that she had stayed there. The victim P. C-D claimed that even to this day, she has not recovered those belongings, and she later saw that her clothes were being worn by the girls in the house. It is possible that the laptop is with the accused N. G., as it is a black and gray Acer laptop.
Continuing her statement, the victim P. C-D mentioned that on the evening she left, the accused N. G. accessed her Facebook and WhatsApp Web accounts from her laptop and sent various messages to her acquaintances. Additionally, the accused N. G. posted indecent photos and videos of her on the victim's Facebook profile, which she had previously sent to a person named N. G. to be posted on OnlyFans, with the understanding that only the accused N. G. had access to those photos.
Furthermore, the victim P. C-D stated that she had multiple discussions with the accused R. L. and N. G., and during one of these discussions, the accused R. L. admitted that the accused N. G. had posted those photos and videos on the Facebook profile. The victim P. C-D mentioned that immediately after finding out that those things had been posted on her Facebook page, she changed the password and deleted all the posts that didn't belong to her.
These aspects were also confirmed by a person named A S-A., who, during her testimony, recounted that during a visit, one of the girls living in the house, whom she knows as C because she was not allowed to leave the house without their permission, called the police and claimed she was being held captive. She mentioned that this event took place around October 28, 2021, when she hadn't moved in yet. Before the police arrived, the accused N. G. got very angry with C because she had called the police, and she went into C's room with the intention of kicking her out. To avoid leaving any marks of violence on C's body, who had recently undergone breast implant surgery, the accused N. G. raised her arm and did not physically harm her. The accused N. G. admitted that the purpose was to disrupt C's surgery, saying, "I wasn't dumb enough to hit her and leave marks." A S-A. mentioned that at that time, besides her and C, there were also G., Eli, BV., Ștrumfi, and I (the accused N. G. and R. A. L., and the individuals P. Y., A.B. G., and A M A., also known as "....."). The accused N. G. and R. L. instructed everyone to gather C's belongings in bags and hide them in the attic so that the police wouldn't find them. Previously, C had been kicked out of the house without clothes or any luggage. When the police arrived with C, the accused N. G. and R. L. denied knowing C and claimed she had never lived there. On that day, C left with the police, and the next day, the accused N. G. and R. L. were summoned to the police station.
A S-A. further stated that on the day of the incident, E. (the accused R. A. L.) said that she had "connections in the police, worked in the police, and nothing would happen." She also mentioned that the accused R. L. often claimed to have worked in the police to intimidate them or make them feel protected and not worried about engaging in illegal activities.
According to the statement given by a witness named A S-A., following C's departure, as an act of revenge, the accused N. G., with the help of A.B. G. and A M A., broke into C's accounts using her laptop, which had been left in the house. During this time, the accused N. G. was at her home and did all these things while talking on the phone with A.B. G. A S-A. stated that she was present as she had already moved into the house. Once they obtained the passwords, the accused N. G. and R. L. posted several indecent photos and videos on C's accounts, threatening all the girls that if anyone else tried to leave, things would get worse. A S-A. also mentioned that all of C's belongings were taken to the house of the accused T. T. and A. T., specifically in the room of T. A., as all the girls, especially the accused N. G., said, "No one is allowed to enter A.'s room."
Regarding the money earned on the OnlyFans platform, the victim P. C-D stated that she did not receive any money, as the accused R. A. L. and N. G. told her she hadn't earned anything.
The victim P. C-D claimed that these statements were not true because during that period, she sent them photos and videos daily specifically for posting on OnlyFans. The OnlyFans accounts were not linked to the victim's card; instead, a foreign card, suspected to belong to G., was used, and the real beneficiaries of the money earned from OnlyFans were the accused T. T. and A. T. Additionally, at one point, A.B. G. received the sum of 3000 lei from the accused N. G., money she had earned from OnlyFans. Both she and the other girls received a 50% share of the earnings from OnlyFans and TikTok, but they never signed a contract to that effect. The other girls received their share physically in cash or through Revolut directly from the accused N. G.
At one point, the accused R. A. L. told her that she would receive only 25% of the amount earned, while the remaining 25% would go to the accused T. T. and A. T.
She also mentioned that in a conversation with A.B. G., she learned from her that the accused T. A. scolded her because he had learned from the accused T. T. that she wasn't working enough and not earning enough money, and T. A. believed that A.B. G. was embarrassing him.
The victim P. C-D stated that she believed that throughout the time she worked for the accused T. T. and A. T., the accused N. G. played a role in manipulating all of them by showing willingness to help but actually playing a double role.
According to her statement, the accused N. G. is the right-hand person of the brothers T., having a close relationship with them and spending a lot of time together. The accused N. G. administers the bank accounts of the accused T. T. and A. T. and carries out payments for them. The victim P. C-D mentioned the same things about the accused R. A. L., stating that she was always in the company of the brothers T. T. and A. T.
She further claimed that the accused T. T. and A. T. had multiple girlfriends at the same time, which was their recruitment tactic. The accused T. A. was in a relationship with both P. I. and A.B. G., even sleeping with both of them at the same time. When one of the accused T. T. or A. T. got to know a new girl, the ones they were already in a relationship with had to accept that they were getting new girlfriends, and they would introduce themselves to the new girls as employees. Every time a new girl was recruited, the accused T. T. and A. T. threw a party to display the opulent lifestyle they could offer, as they did in her case.
According to the statement of the victim P. C-D, the accused T. T. and A. T. had sexual relationships with the recruited girls, often requesting group sex. In this regard, the victim P. C-D mentioned that the accused T. T. also asked her to have sex with him and another girl named Carmen, which she initially refused. However, after consuming alcoholic beverages, she engaged in sexual relations with the accused T. T. and Carmen.
The victim P. C-D claimed that for the OnlyFans and TikTok platforms, American SIM cards were used, and through a VPN, they appeared to be banned in Romania. She mentioned that she withdrew money from TikTok only once, around 50 dollars. The TikTok money was transferred to a PayPal account and then to a bank account.
Regarding the charges of human trafficking against the accused P. Y. and A.B. G., the judge determined that their involvement was evident from the statements of the victims U.A. and G. E. A., which were corroborated by the statements of A S-A., the victim P. C-D, and the conversations between the accused and these individuals. The judge did not consider the statements of P. Y. and A.B. G. as they were clearly still under the influence of the accused T. T. and T. E. A., and had close relationships with the accused N. G. M. and R. A. L.
Therefore, the victim U.A. stated that P. Y. and A.B. G. told her that they were doing OnlyFans and that half of their earnings were given to the accused A. T. and T. T. According to her statement, P. Y. had been working for the accused T. T. and A. T. for about a year and told the victim G. E. A many intimate details, such as the fact that she was actually in a relationship with the accused A. T., not the victim U.A. P. Y. attempted to get close to the victim G. E. A but failed as she realized P. Y. was lying. The victim U.A. also mentioned that she knew that if the girls didn't post on OnlyFans, the accused A. T. and T. T. would fine them, and P. Y. owed them 4000 euros. Furthermore, the victim U.A. stated that P. Y. had a tattoo with the inscription "Owned by T.," indicating her belonging to T. T. The accused T. E. A. told her that P. Y. did it for the boys and that she was grateful. The victim U.A. believed that P. Y. and A.B. G. "had been brainwashed and would do anything the accused T. T. and A. T. asked."
From the statement of the victim G. E. A, it resulted that when she moved to the other house, the girls living there, namely P. Y., A.B. G., and A M A., were posting on OnlyFans. She further mentioned in her statement that one of the girls who was in a relationship with the accused A. T., namely P. Y., said that if anyone tried to intervene in their relationship, she was capable of doing anything, or if the accused A. T. asked her to kill someone, she was willing to do it.
Furthermore, the victim G. E. A stated that the girls had to post exactly the photos and videos instructed by the accused T. T. and A. T., and if they didn't do so, they would be fined. In this regard, P. Y. had a debt of 4000 dollars.
A witness named A S-A. declared that all the girls in a relationship with the accused A. T. had a tattoo with his name and a cobra. She mentioned that P. Y. told her that it was the accused A. T. who had influenced her to get those tattoos and even scolded her because one of the tattoos was too small. A S-A. stated that, from her point of view, the reason the accused A. T. made them get tattoos was to show ownership.
According to the statement of A S-A., both I and BV. (referring to P. Y. and A.B. G. respectively) make videos for OnlyFans. She also mentioned that the accused N. G. and R. A. L. had established that she and the individuals P. Y., A.B. G., and A M A., referred to as ".....," should make a minimum of 10,000 euros per month on TikTok.
She further declared that the individual A.B. G., referred to as "BV.," is the girlfriend of the accused T. A., and she and A.B. G. did not have the role of managing the accounts or dividing the sums of money. Moreover, according to A S-A.'s statement, the individual P. I is the girlfriend of the accused T. A., and she and P. I did not have the role of managing the accounts or dividing the sums of money.
Regarding OnlyFans, A S-A. declared that P. Y., A.B. G., and A M A., referred to as ".....," did not have access to the accounts, only the accused N. G. and R. A. L. did, and they would tell them what videos and photos to post. She specified that the accused N. G. and R. A. L. had the passwords for her accounts and the accounts of P. Y., A.B. G., and A M A., referred to as ".....," and they would check how much money they made each day. At the end of the month, they would inform them how much money they made on OnlyFans and give them a portion of these sums in cash. She mentioned that only she and P. Y. received the money in hand, but she doesn't know how A.B. G. received the sums of money.
A S-A. also declared that both the accused R. L. and N. G. verbally abused and threatened them, saying they would beat them if they didn't do their job, both her and the individuals P. Y., A.B. G., and A M A., referred to as ".....". At one point, the accused N. G. made her and the individuals P. Y., A.B. G., and A M A., referred to as ".....," sign papers in which they committed to earning the sum of 10,000 euros per month from TikTok, and if they didn't achieve these amounts, all the money would be taken by the accused N. G. A S-A. stated that she did not sign that paper, and neither did A.B. G., but P. I signed it.
From the statement of the victim P. C-D, it resulted that the individual P. I told her that the money she earned from OnlyFans was given to the accused A. T., considering that he had invested in her, meaning that she had dental work done, and later she also got breast implants. The victim P. C-D further stated that what she was doing, P. I, A.B. G., and others were doing as well. She also mentioned that she was part of a WhatsApp group named "Moarte suspectă" (Suspicious Death), along with the accused N. G., the individual P. I, A M A., and A.B. G.
Regarding the individual P. I, the victim P. C-D specified that she was very naive and manipulated by the accused A. T., who referred to her as "Bitch" only. She was constantly blackmailed by the accused N. G. with the threat of revealing her activities to her parents. Additionally, the victim mentioned that P. I was not allowed to leave the location alone and was always accompanied by the accused N. G. or the individuals A.B. G. or A M A.. The victim also stated that the accused T. T. and A. T. had multiple girlfriends at the same time, and it was their recruitment tactic. The accused T. A. was in a relationship with both P. I and A.B. G., and even slept with both of them at the same time.
Regarding the income obtained from posting videos and photos made by the victims on the OnlyFans and TikTok platforms, according to the statement of the victim U.A., the income obtained from the TikTok videos is divided, half of the amount goes to the girls, and the other half goes to the brothers A.T. and T.T. As for the posts made on OnlyFans, the girls are unaware of the income they generate. Additionally, it was mentioned that she does not know exactly how the business of the two brothers works, but she knows that if the girls do not post on OnlyFans, the defendants A.T. and T.T. impose fines on them, with the named P.Y. owing them a sum of 4000 Euros.
It has been found that these aspects regarding the income obtained from posts and the fines applied if the girls do not make these posts are confirmed by the statements of the victim G.E.A., who stated that the amounts of money the girls earned from live videos on the TikTok application were divided equally with the defendants T.A. and T.T. They received a percentage of 50-65%. As for the posts on the OnlyFans website, the girls had no knowledge of the amounts they were earning. It was stated that the defendants R.L. and N.G., as well as the defendants T.A. and T.T., were the ones who knew the real value of the sums, and they told the other girls some amounts they allegedly earned from these posts. Additionally, the girls were required to post exactly the photos and videos that the T. brothers instructed them, and if they didn't do so, fines were imposed on them.
The statements of the victims U.A. and G.E.A. were also corroborated by the statement of the named A.S-A., according to which the defendants N.G. and R.L. had the passwords for all the accounts they used, including hers, P.Y.'s, A.B.G.'s, and A.M.A.'s, and they would check how much money they made each day. After the calculations were done, A.S-A. would transfer 50% of the money earned on TikTok in that month to N.G. through Revolut. She further mentioned that for deviations, such as not adhering to the fixed time set by N.G., staying on a break for too long, crying during the live stream, or wiping their nose during the live stream, different percentages were deducted, approximately 10% for each deviation. Thus, A.S-A. stated that most of the time, she received less than half of the earned amount. As for OnlyFans, she stated that she, P.Y., A.B.G., and A.M.A. did not have access to the accounts, only the defendants N.G. and R.L. did. At the end of the month, they would inform them of the amount they made on OnlyFans and give them a portion of those sums in cash.
A.S-A. claimed that she didn't know how much money she earned on OnlyFans; it is possible that she earned more than what the defendants N.G. and R.L. told her. However, on TikTok, she earned approximately 5000 Euros each month, and her portion on OnlyFans was around 300-400 Euros. She mentioned that the defendants N.G. and R.L. always told them that the other girls were making around 40000 Euros on OnlyFans, and she, P.Y., A.B.G., and A.M.A. were weak in that regard.
Similarly, the statement of the victim P.C-D indicated that she didn't receive any money from the OnlyFans platform. The defendants R.L. and N.G. told her that she didn't earn anything. The victim mentioned that this was not true because she sent photos and videos daily to be posted on OnlyFans. She clarified that her personal card was not attached to those OnlyFans accounts; instead, a foreign card was used, and the real beneficiaries of the money obtained from OnlyFans were the defendants T.T. and T.A. The victim stated that the named A.B.-G. received a sum of 3000 lei at some point, representing money earned from OnlyFans. She mentioned that she and the other girls had a 50% share in the earnings from TikTok and OnlyFans but never signed any contracts to that effect. The other girls received their share of the money daily, either in cash or through Revolut, directly from the defendant N.G. The victim stated that at one point, the defendant R.L. told her that she would only receive 25% of the amount she earned, and the remaining 25% would go to the T.A. brothers.
These same aspects regarding the distribution of the money also emerged from the conversations held by the defendant R.A.L. with the defendants N.G.M. and the named A.B.G.

July 18th House Arrest motivation quotes
“By the order pronounced on June 23, 2023, the preliminary chamber judge found the legality and grounds for the house arrest measure of the four defendants and ordered its maintenance.
To issue these solutions, the preliminary chamber judge and the judge of rights and freedoms considered cumulatively fulfilled the provisions of Article 223 paragraph (2) of the Criminal Procedure Code, in conjunction with Article 202 paragraph (1) and (3) of the Criminal Procedure Code, namely that there is evidence suggesting a reasonable presumption that the defendants committed the crimes they are accused of, mainly the offenses of forming a criminal organization and human trafficking, and considering the nature of the offenses, the penalties provided by law for them, the manner in which they were committed, and the personal circumstances of the defendants, the imposition and extension of preventive arrest, and subsequently the imposition, extension, and maintenance of house arrest measures for the defendants brought to trial were necessary.”
“Therefore, preliminarily, based on the aspects observed and stated earlier, the preliminary chamber judge finds that the preventive measure, the legality and grounds of which are to be verified, was legally imposed and maintained against the four defendants.
Continuing the verification, the preliminary chamber judge examines whether the general conditions required for the imposition and maintenance of a preventive measure, as provided by Article 202 paragraphs (1) and (3) of the Criminal Procedure Code, namely the need for substantial evidence or reasonable indicators suggesting that the accused committed a crime, the proportionality of the measure to the gravity of the criminal acts attributed to them, the necessary nature of the respective measure for achieving its purpose, and the absence of any cause preventing the initiation or exercise of criminal action, are still met in the case of the house arrest measure against the defendants.”
The court considers that the grounds that led to the imposition of house arrest against the defendants are still valid. Specifically, until this procedural stage, no new elements have emerged that would alter the conclusions reached by the judge of rights and freedoms when the house arrest measure was ordered and subsequently maintained, and the evidence administered in the case during the criminal investigation continues to justify the reasonable assumption regarding the commission of offenses stipulated by the criminal law, in the sense of Article 202 paragraph (1) of the Criminal Procedure Code.”
“Furthermore, given the nature of the offenses for which the defendants were sent to trial, as well as the presumed affected social relations and their consequences, considering the stage of the criminal process, the preliminary chamber judge believes that house arrest remains necessary to prevent the defendants from evading the trial of this case and to ensure the proper conduct of the criminal proceedings.
Specifically, the preliminary chamber judge considers that the defendants ..., ..., ..., ..., citizens of ..., who have substantial financial means, with multiple internal and international connections, do not provide sufficient guarantees that the purpose for which the measure was taken and maintained can also be achieved with the defendants continuing under a non-custodial preventive measure. Considering the well-established and sustained connection between the four defendants, the previous arguments also apply to the defendants ..., and ....”
“Likewise, in the analysis of the legality and grounds of the house arrest measure, the preliminary chamber judge considers that the measure under review remains fully proportional to the gravity of the offenses attributed to the defendants. In this regard, the preliminary chamber judge takes into account the gravity of the offenses attributed to the defendants, motivated by the complexity of the offenses against individuals, organized by the defendants, offenses that also involved ... In addition, the accusations are serious due to the number of affected persons, the extended period of action, and the combined manner in which the four defendants acted.
Lastly, in the analysis performed, the Tribunal considers that the reasonable term provided by Article 5 paragraph 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights has not been exceeded, given the complexity of the case and the extent of the evidence administered and to be administered.”
