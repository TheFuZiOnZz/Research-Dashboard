- President Díaz-Canel said the protests were being led by a minority of “counter-revolutionaries, sold out to the U.S. government,” taking advantage of the difficult situation in Cuba and the pandemic.

- Venezuela's oil industry collapsed. This [NYTimes article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/07/world/americas/venezuela-oil-economy-maduro.html) covers it well, and [this graph](https://imgur.com/HkSWQ9J) from [this page](https://oec.world/en/visualize/line/hs92/export/ven/show/527/2013.2019/) show Venezuela's oil exports dropping sharply in 2019, all before the pandemic even hit.
