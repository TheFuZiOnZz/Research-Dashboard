- In 1860, 
	- `Nevertheless, by the late 1870s a handful of Arabs were urging at least a measure of separation from the empire. Earlier, groups had formed in Damascus and Beirut whose purpose, paradoxically influenced by European currents of thought and American missionaries, was the promotion of Arab culture. The Society of Arts and Sciences was founded in 1847, and the Syrian Scientific Society in 1857. The dominant figures were the Lebanese Christian writers and educators NasTf Yaziji (1800-71) and Butrus al-Bustani (1819-83). Separatist impulses and disillusionment with the empire were particularly strong among Lebanese Christians, and grew as a consequence of the Muslim-Druze massacre of Maronites in Mount Lebanon and Damascus in 1860.` - [Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-2001, Benny Morris](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/bafykbzaced6rtb5d4wthw3wapbnqafd3w7znfmikvzx43dqifs5amzbyzltas?filename=Righteous%20Victims%3A%20A%20History%20of%20the%20Zionist-Arab%20Conflict%2C%20--%20Benny%20Morris%20--%202001%20--%20Vintage%20--%209780679744757%20--%200ffdde5f35058146403a55786f6cfc18%20--%20Anna%E2%80%99s%20Archive.pdf)
	- `Bustani preached a Syrian consciousness and patriotism that transcended religious-ethnic origins. He regarded the area of present-day Lebanon and Syria as one country (bilad suriyya) and wrote that "Syria is our fatherland (watari) and the population of Syria, whatever their creed, community, racial origin or groups are the sons of our fatherland." Separatist impulses also existed in Syria proper. In 1858 the British consul in Aleppo, J. H. Skene, reported that the "Mussulman population of Northern Syria harbors hopes of a separation from the Ottoman Empire and the formation of a new Arabian State under the sovereignty of the Shereefs of Mecca."` - [Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-2001, Benny Morris](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/bafykbzaced6rtb5d4wthw3wapbnqafd3w7znfmikvzx43dqifs5amzbyzltas?filename=Righteous%20Victims%3A%20A%20History%20of%20the%20Zionist-Arab%20Conflict%2C%20--%20Benny%20Morris%20--%202001%20--%20Vintage%20--%209780679744757%20--%200ffdde5f35058146403a55786f6cfc18%20--%20Anna%E2%80%99s%20Archive.pdf)
