# What is Social Democracy?
Test
## Define
- Social Democracy is when the government does stuff, more specifically that the government helps create a basic standard of living through well researched growth plans and tax policy focusing on primarily Wealth Inequality and Income Mobility to create a prosperous model for all.
- `Social democracy (sometimes used synonymously with democratic socialism) refers to a political tendency resting on three fundamental features: (1) democracy (e.g., equal rights to vote and form parties), (2) an economy partly regulated by the state (e.g., through Keynesianism), and (3) a welfare state offering social support to those in need (e.g., equal rights to education, health service, employment, and pensions).` [[link]](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/bafykbzacebgzz6ymnszyxxyf36llncqhplu4zilj5nsajnxynpaxpiymbldq4?filename=Bertrand%20Badie%2C%20Dirk%20Berg-Schlosser%2C%20Leonardo%20Morlino%20-%20International%20Encyclopedia%20of%20Political%20Science-SAGE%20Publications%2C%20Inc%20%282011%29.pdf) - International encyclopedia of political science, Badie et al., 2011

### Swedish Renn-Meidner Model
- The Rehn–Meidner model is an economic and wage policy model developed in 1951 by two economists at the research department of the Swedish Trade Union Confederation, Gösta Rehn and Rudolf Meidner. The four main goals to be achieved were: Low inflation, Full employment, High growth and Income equality.
- A 1993 Rudolf Meidner paper called `Why did the Swedish Model Fail?`, ironically, characterized many achievements of the model
    
    > `Full employment was maintained practically for the whole period. At the same time, the labour force participation rate rose to a peak European level, primarily because of the almost total integration of women into the labour market. By drawing on the whole population in the active ages, the input of labour is higher in Sweden than in any other European country - in spite of longer vacations and other leaves of absence.` [[link]](https://socialistregister.com/index.php/srv/article/view/5630/2528) - Why Did the Swedish Model Fail?, Meidner, 1993
    > 
    > > A 1996 report found that `Some trends are easily discernible from Table 7. From 1965 to 1994, the inflow to unemployment falls across almost the whole period and then starts to increase again in the 1990s, while duration increases continually (except for a small decline in the 'overheated' years In the late 1980s). Whilst both these trends relate to prime-aged people (25-54 years), It is among the elderly (55-64 years) that duration has increased the most since the mid-1960s,` [[link]](http://aei.pitt.edu/60360/1/SWEDEN.pdf) - Labour market studies. Sweden, European Commission, 1997
    
    > `Most importantly, the programme allotted to the state the responsibility for achieving and maintaining full employment. Leading social democrats, among them Gunnar Myrdal, talked about the 'harvest time' of Swedish Socialism. Instead it turned out to be the last time that leading members of the party used the term 'socialism'.` [[link]](https://socialistregister.com/index.php/srv/article/view/5630/2528) - Why Did the Swedish Model Fail?, Meidner, 1993
    
    > `The universal welfare system developed into a network which meets all social needs - from the cradle to the grave. In the 1980s public expenditures reached a peak of 55 per cent of GDP and had to be financed by Western Europe's highest taxes. The public sector expanded immensely to employ one third of the labour force.` [[link]](https://socialistregister.com/index.php/srv/article/view/5630/2528) - Why Did the Swedish Model Fail?, Meidner, 1993
    
    > `The wage policy of solidarity contributed to the compression of wage differentials'" The gap between male and female wages narrowed considerably, as a result of special clauses in the centrally negotiated contracts which favoured low paid workers.` [[link]](https://socialistregister.com/index.php/srv/article/view/5630/2528) - Why Did the Swedish Model Fail?, Meidner, 1993
    > 
    > > A 2000 paper found that `From 1956 up to 1983, without interruption, two peak bargaining organizations, LO for workers and SAF for employers, negotiated detailed “framework” wage agreements covering the entire blue-collar labor force in Swedish private industry. Equality of wage distribution was a vital union goal, and wage dispersion data indicate that, during this era of centralized “solidarity” bargaining, LO succeeded in obtaining large changes in the structure of relative wages. In fact, as the data graphed in figure 1 illustrate, between the early 1960s and the breakdown of central wage formation in the early 1980s, the total variance of bluecollar relative wages declined by a whopping 75%.` [[link]](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1086/209976) - Wage Dispersion and Productive Efficiency: Evidence for Sweden, Hibbs Jr. and Locking, 2000
    
    > `At the beginning of the 80s, Sweden showed the most egalitarian wage structure amongst Western countries. This was achieved through a labour market policy which relieved the unions of the responsibilities for employment problems caused by wage claims for the low-paid in declining firms and branches.` [[link]](https://socialistregister.com/index.php/srv/article/view/5630/2528) - Why Did the Swedish Model Fail?, Meidner, 1993
    
    > `Social democratic Full employment Price stability Combination of restrictive general measures and selective labour market policy governments also accommodated the unions in another way: excess profits - which make wage restraint in profitable firms hazardous for the local unions - have been at least partly neutralized by payments into different funds, (among them the union-administered wage-earner funds - albeit in a rather symbolic shape, as we shall see).` [[link]](https://socialistregister.com/index.php/srv/article/view/5630/2528) - Why Did the Swedish Model Fail?, Meidner, 1993
    
  
- A 2003 paper found that:
    
    > `The response of management, we argue, was a perfectly rational one to a serious labour problem. The most dynamic and largest firms in the economy faced severe labour supply shortages in the early postwar years that threatened to compromise their competitive position and choke off growth. Ironically, it was the Rehn-Meidner plan, the work of two labour union economists, that saved the day. While centralised wage bargaining played an instrumental role in the plan, it was the former, not the latter, that created the conditions for wage moderation. As we explain in this article, the purpose of the plan was to promote economic expansion with full employment and low inflation and to ensure that labour received its fair share of the growth dividend. The process was ingenious and simple. Wage increases for low paid workers would exceed increases for those higher up on the pay scale. This would compel low-wage firms to shut down (or raise productivity) and would thus liberate workers for employment in the high- wage, high-growth sectors. Labour transfer was to be facilitated by an active labour market policy on the part of the government - retraining, relocation, and job search assistance. Centralised wage determination was viewed strictly as a means to an end - it made possible wage compression from below and fostered labour release. In essence, then, the Rehn-Meidner plan produced wage moderation in a very conventional manner - it facilitated an increase in the supply of labour to the most dynamic sectors of the economy. In this respect, the Swedish experience is much closer to that of, say, Germany and Italy than is usually recognised.` [[link]](https://www.economics.utoronto.ca/malex/cwbjan28full.pdf) - Centralized Wage Bargaining and Structural Change In Sweden, Alexopoulos, 2003
    
- A 2010 paper found that:
    
    > `The typical Swedish economic and wage policy program — the R-M model — was never consistently implemented. Yet, a period from the late 1950s to the early 1970s was the golden age for the model; it legitimized the expansion of labor-market policy and the practice of the wage policy of solidarity in Sweden. There were some unique Swedish circumstances behind the application of the R-M model — the highly coordinated wage bargaining system, the strong position for state interventionism, the political dominance of the social democrats and the strength and priorities of LO. Also, by emphasizing price-stability and growth, the R-M model yielded a strong economic rationale for labor-market policies and wage policy of solidarity. Swedish deviations from the model since the middle of the 1970s are explained by negative policy experiences, lost positions and new strategies of LO, new generations of economic policy decision makers, new economic theories (challenging discretionary economic policy) and the growing influence of economists in the Ministry of Finance. The break with the R-M model is also explained by less coordinated wage bargaining (threatening the wage policy of solidarity) and by political-institutional changes, primarily deregulation of credit markets (leading to overheating in the 1980s) and new exchange-rate systems (providing more space for profit booms through devaluations/depreciations).` [[link]](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.2753/jei0021-3624440306) - The Rehn-Meidner Model in Sweden: Its Rise, Challenges and Survival, Erixon, 2010

## Poverty
Poverty is the state of not having enough material possessions or income for a person's basic needs.
- A 2017 paper found that
    
    > `Low socio-economic status has repeatedly been listed as a risk factor for numerous metabolic conditions, including obesity, type 2 diabetes and CVD. Although the influences of socio-economic status on health are complex and multifactorial, and although metabolic diseases often include environmental and genetic risk, the contribution of dietary factors is not trivial. In this Opinion, we have considered how the dietary trade-offs faced by individuals who do not consume a beneficial ratio of whole, minimally processed foods (for either financial or social reasons) can have a negative impact on the basic metabolism, immune system and general health of the host, in a manner that is at least partly dependent on the microbiota.` [[link]](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1038/nri.2017.121) - How poverty affects diet to shape the microbiota and chronic disease, Harrison and Taren, 2018

    > `Poverty traps are one of the most fundamental concepts in development economics. The contribution of this paper has been to provide evidence for their existence using the combination of a randomized asset transfer and an 11-year panel in rural Bangladesh. Our key finding is that people stay poor because they lack opportunity. It is not their intrinsic characteristics that trap people in poverty but rather their circumstances. This has three implications for how we think about development policy.` ... `The first is that big pushes that enable occupational change will be needed to address the global mass poverty problem.` ... `The second is that big push policies can have long-lasting effects.` ... `The third is that poverty traps create mismatches between talent and jobs.` [[link]](https://web.archive.org/web/20210417172804/https://economics.mit.edu/files/21191) - Why Do People Stay Poor?, Balboni et al., 2022

## Wealth Inequality
Wealth inequality is the unequal distribution of assets among residents of a country.
- The Gini index is a statistical measure used to represent unequal distributions, e.g. income distribution. It can take any value between 1 and 100 points (or 0 and 1). The closer the value is to 100 the greater is the inequality. 40 or 0.4 is the warning level set by the United Nations. Using this index, we see the U.S. higher compared to Social Democratic countries like Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden.

- A 2018 paper by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board found that every kind of inequality is getting worse, wealth inequality, income inequality and consumption inequality in regards to the share of the top 5% compared to the bottom 95%. [[link]](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2018001pap.pdf) - Inequality in 3-D: Income, Consumption, and Wealth, Fisher et al., 2018
- Oxfam published a study on the wealth across the globe, Eighty two percent of the wealth generated in 2017 went to the richest one percent of the global population. The 3.7 billion people who make up the poorest half of the world saw no increase in their wealth in 2017. [[link]](https://www.oxfam.org/en/press-releases/richest-1-percent-bagged-82-percent-wealth-created-last-year-poorest-half-humanity)
- Inequality.org finds that the Top 1% Income Share Has Doubled While Poverty Has Held Steady. An estimated 40 percent of the total U.S. population (140 million people) are either poor or low-income. The nation’s highest 0.01 percent and 0.1 percent of income-earners have seen their incomes rise much faster than the rest of the top 1 percent in recent decades. The top 1 percent of U.S. earners take home a disproportionate amount of income compared to even the nation’s highest fifth of earners. CBO data indicate that the top 1 percent earns 85 times as much as the bottom 20 percent. There is a causal Negative Relationship Between Union Membership and Skewed Growth.

    > `As the share of the workforce represented by a union has declined to less than 11 percent since their peak in the 1940s and 1950s, those at the top of the income scale have increased their power to rig economic rules in their favor, further increasing income inequality.` [[link]](https://inequality.org/facts/income-inequality/)
    
- Top CEOs make more than 300 times that of the average worker.

- Younger people face unique systemic disadvantages, such as unemployment, lack of housing, and student debt, indicative of an inadequate economy.

Although this would seem that removing all Wealth Inequality is a good idea, but for example, Zero wage inequality would be bad for a market because small differences in pay can enormously increase productivity, such as in “merit pay” for teachers

> A 2020 Paper found that `Empirical research investigating the association between teacher pay incentives and student test scores has grown rapidly over the past decade. To integrate the findings from these studies and help inform the debate over teacher merit pay, this meta-analysis synthesizes effect sizes across 37 primary studies, 26 of which were conducted in the United States. Among the U.S. based studies, the results suggest that the effect of teacher merit pay on student test scores is positive and statistically significant (0.043 standard deviation). This summary effect varies by program design and study context, suggesting that teacher merit pay has the potential to improve student test scores in some contexts but researchers and policymakers should pay close attention to program design and implementation.` [[link]](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.3102/0002831220905580) - Teacher Merit Pay: A Meta-Analysis, Pham et al., 2021
## Income Mobility
Income mobility is the ability of an individual, family or some other group to improve (or lower) their economic status.
- The Global Social Mobility Index founded by The World Economic Forum is a statistical measure used to represent in individual countries, how many generations it would take a poor family to reach the median income of that country. It can take any value between 1 and 100 points (or 0 and 1). The closer the value is to 100 the greater is the mobility. Using this index, we see the U.S. higher compared to Social Democratic countries like Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. [[link]](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/01/these-are-the-10-countries-with-the-best-social-mobility/)
- A 2007 report found that

## The Great Gatsby Curve
The Great Gatsby curve is a chart plotting the relationship between inequality and intergenerational social immobility using both the Gini and Global Social Mobility Indexes. Social democratic countries tend to rank low in both inequality and mobility.

## General Wellbeing
- In the 2020 World Happiness report, under the section called `The Nordic Exceptionalism` it discusses `What exactly makes Nordic citizens so exceptionally satisfied with their lives?` it concludes that:
    
    > `While this chapter focuses on the Nordic countries, a quick glance at the other countries regularly found at the top of international comparisons of life satisfaction – Switzerland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Canada, and Australia – reveals that they also have most of the same elements in place. Thus, there seems to be no secret sauce specific to Nordic happiness that is unavailable to others. There is rather a more general recipe for creating highly satisfied citizens: Ensure that state institutions are of high quality, non-corrupt, able to deliver what they promise, and generous in taking care of citizens in various adversities.` [[link]](https://happiness-report.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/WHR20_Ch7.pdf) - The Nordic Exceptionalism: What Explains Why the Nordic Countries are Constantly Among the Happiest in the World, World Happiness Report et al., 2020

# Social Safety Nets
## Socialised Healthcare
### Medicare for All
### Economic Analysis of Medicare for All, Pollin et al., 2018
- A 2018 paper by The Political Economy Research Institute identifies that in 2017 the US was spending $3.24 trillion on personal healthcare but other high income countries spend around 40% less and produce better healthcare outcomes. Medicare for all would reduce healthcare spending by nearly 10% to $2.93 trillion and create "stable access to good care for all US residents."
- The study gives a good explanation regarding what medicare for all is and the goals: "The primary goal of Medicare for All is to provide high-quality health care to all U.S. residents. This includes full coverage for the 8.8 percent of the population that is presently uninsured and the 26 percent of the population that is underinsured. Medicare for All also aims to provide stable access to decent coverage to all U.S. residents, including those who currently receive adequate care but may face difficulties at later points."
    
    > "our results show that Medicare for All can promote both lower costs and greater equity in the financing of health care in the United States." [[link]](https://web.archive.org/web/20230423162841/https://peri.umass.edu/publication/item/download/805_a3e545f40523864e46158aca8ebbb158) - Economic Analysis of Medicare for All, Pollin et al., 2018
    
- Among the main findings of the study are that other countries which have implemented some kind of universal healthcare generate better outcomes than the current system in the US.
    
    > "It is also the case that, on balance, other countries that provide universal health care generate superior health outcomes relative to the U.S. Another 2017 study summarizes some key evidence as follows: 'In other countries, a shift to universal health care has been associated with reduced mortality. Specifically, 34 countries score higher than the USA on the Health Access and Quality Index, a metric based on amenable mortality, or death that could be averted with medical care. All of these countries provide a form of universal care.'" [[link]](https://web.archive.org/web/20230423162841/https://peri.umass.edu/publication/item/download/805_a3e545f40523864e46158aca8ebbb158) - Economic Analysis of Medicare for All, Pollin et al., 2018
    
- In regard to the cost saving potential under medicare for all, the study identifies that "through implementation of Medicare for All, overall costs of providing full health care coverage to all U.S. residents could fall by about 19 percent in the first year of full operations relative to spending levels under the existing system."
    
    > The breakdown of the savings is as follows: "1) administration (9.0 percent savings in total system costs); 2) pharmaceutical pricing (5.9 percent savings in system costs); and 3) establishing uniform Medicare rates for hospitals, physicians, and clinics (2.8 percent savings in system costs)." This totals up to 17.7% savings and the other savings which would make this total add up to the aforementioned 19% would be achieved by addressing"1) unnecessary services; 2) inefficiently delivered services; 3) missed prevention opportunities; and 4) fraud," which would lead to savings of 1.5% (Figure 1 below). [[link]](https://web.archive.org/web/20230423162841/https://peri.umass.edu/publication/item/download/805_a3e545f40523864e46158aca8ebbb158) - Economic Analysis of Medicare for All, Pollin et al., 2018
    
- The study identifies two sources which could/would be sourced to finance medicare for all: current revenue sources and a multitude of other sources. Current revenue sources account for $1.88 trillion, meaning the extra ~$1.05 trillion (the study assumes $1.08 trillion for the purposes of analysis) would need to come from other sources the study identifies like cutting business healthcare premiums by 8% relative to existing spending per worker, a 3.75% sales tax on non-necessities, a net worth tax of 0.38%, and taxing long-term capital gains as ordinary income (see page 9 of the study for more in-depth analysis).
    
    > Current revenue sources: "The first is the same public health care revenue sources that presently provide about 60 percent of all U.S. health care financing. These include Medicare and Medicaid, which together finance nearly 40 percent of all health care funding.

- When looking at the impact on families, low and middle income families would see their healthcare spending reduced by anywhere from 0.8% to 14% (Figure 2).
- On a macroeconomics level, the study reports that, over a 10 year period in which healthcare is 15.8% of America's GDP (as opposed to 17.2% as it is now), implementing medicare for all would raise productivity thanks to improved health outcomes, support greater income equality, and support job creation (see page 16 of the study for further analysis).

### U.S. Student Loan Forgiveness
- A 2017 paper found that `There are serious problems associated with the current design of US student loans, due largely to the difficulties many students face in repaying. After all, there are considerable risks associated with the process of acquiring a college degree, and substantial uncertainty related to the individual financial returns to higher education. Loan arrangements which don’t take these uncertainties into account, such as the system in place in the US, have great potential for creating adversity for borrowers. This paper draws lessons from Australia and England to suggest how this problem can be solved. The problem arises because with a conventional loan, with fixed monthly repayments, the duration of the loan and monthly repayments do not respond to changes in income, so that the ability to pay depends crucially on having sufficient income to make these loans affordable.` [[link]](https://www.researchcghe.org/perch/resources/publications/wp16.pdf)
- A 2018 paper found that `The claim that increased student aid causes tuition to rise was originated by William Bennett, the secretary of education under Ronald Reagan, in a 1987 New York Times opinion piece. Numerous academic studies since have tested the Bennett hypothesis, and though a few have found some link between rising aid and tuition in at most one sector of higher education, the vast majority have “…found not a shred of evidence of an empirical relationship,” as David Warren wrote in the Washington Post. As Warren notes, three major federal reports in the last fifteen years have each surveyed the existing academic literature, and each concluded that no such relationship exists. The most recent, conducted by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in 2011, took advantage of a unique “natural experiment” to test the Bennett hypothesis: the substantial increases in Stafford Loan limits between 2007 and 2009.22 In 2007, the yearly loan limits, adjusted for inflation, ranged from $2,925 for freshmen to $6,125 for upper classmen. By 2009, they had risen to $5,750 and $7,825, respectively. All told, the yearly borrowing limit for all undergraduates increased by an average of $2,340. However, average tuition at public 4-year universities rose by just $540 over the same two years, in line with recent historical averages, leading the GAO to reject the possibility of a relationship between the two. Additionally, these increases in borrowing limits were the first since 1993, meaning that the inflation-adjusted value of the limit had declined for more than a decade during which tuitions rose steadily. All told, both the empirical evidence and academic consensus deem the Bennett hypothesis false.` [[link]](https://www.demos.org/sites/default/files/publications/Robbie%20admin-bloat.pdf)
- A 2020 paper found that `While the distributional effects of student loan forgiveness are an important aspect of student loan forgiveness, other factors may play a role in determining the desirability of debt forgiveness. Student loans may distort career choices (Rothstein and Rouse, 2011), credit constraints may hinder entrepreneurship Barrios, Hochberg and Yi, 2020), debt overhang may distort labor supply decisions (Donaldson, Piacentino and Thakor, 2019) and debt relief may have macroeconomic consequences (Auclert et al., 2019).` [[link]](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/BFI_WP_2020169.pdf)
### U.K. Student Finance
## Redistributive Cash Transfers
- In 2012, A test of a RCT was conducted in the Philippines, in which families would be given **conditional** grants of flat, untaxed payment depending on their financial and familial situation. The program primarily aimed to test RCT’s ability to break generational poverty and benefit children's future. Parents with children ranging age 0-14 are eligible for the health grants, receiving a total of ₱500 monthly, as long as conditions as to how well families follow health guidelines are met. For the education grants, the only conditions to apply for the benefit of ₱300 per child monthly are to have a child 6-14 in a low-income area, and to make sure the child attends at least 85% of school days.
- Attendance in preschool or daycare was 10.3% higher than the baseline of 65% for the low-income families without the RCT. Similarly, in children aged 6-11, enrolment in elementary school rose 4.5% higher than the baseline 93% in other low income households. However, for children 15-17, RCT had a **slight negative** effect on enrolment, but the RCT **did not** apply to the age group, so a positive effect on education **was not expected for those 15-17.** Similarly to the benefits in enrolment in most age groups, attendance in school **increased** in all age groups.
- Access to prenatal and postnatal care greatly increased for women affected by the RCT health benefits. (Prenatal by 10.5% and postnatal by 10%). It was also found that pregnant recipients of RCT made visits to prenatal facilities 1.6x more than the control. RCT also reduced severe stunting in affected children 6-36 months old by 10.1% from the 24% baseline. Alcohol consumption **reduced** by 39% in households affected by RCT.
- Poor households receiving RCT increased spending on health services by 34%, increased spending on education by 38%, and increased spending on protein-rich foods by 38%. There was a reduction in poverty three years after the program’s initiation by 2.7%. This impact is small, but would likely increase as more time under the program passes for affected families. It was found there was **no significant change** in motivation to work. [[link]](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/13244/755330REVISED000Revised0June0402014.pdf)
- This source lists three pro-RCT points, said points being:
    
    > RCTs have positive effects on children, primarily increased weight for age and weight for height, 15% decreased rates of low birth-weight, and increased school attendance.
    
    > Recipients of RCT use the income well, causing it to create long term benefit. Men’s income increased by 64-96% five years after receiving a transfer.
    
    > Those receiving transfers don’t expend their income on unneeded commodities such as alcohol. There is also no significant impact on work-hours. [[link]](https://www.givedirectly.org/research-on-cash-transfers/)
    
- A World Bank blog post from 2014 makes the claim that recipients of RCT and UBI **do not** use their given income on goods such as alcohol. Examples are as follows:
    
    > When examining 44 estimates of alcohol consumption across 19 studies and 13 interventions, the majority of studies report results of reduced alcohol consumption (82%).
    
    > There is little to no incentive for recipients to lie. The surveyors intentionally do not add items such as alcohol in separate lists, and treat them with the same significance as other household items. It’s also been shown that those with a non-zero baseline for alcohol don’t suddenly report spending nothing on alcohol, instead, they still tend to report a decreased, but not non-zero spending on alcohol. This trend implies that recipients do not try to “game the system,” and rather remain honest about their expenditures.

## Minimum Wage
- There are two scenarios in which are most successful and applicable to the majority of countries, an indexed minimum wage not requiring (but not disencouraging) strong unions, or no minimum wage policies with strong unions and sectoral bargaining, namely the nordic model.
- Seattle is a well studied case for indexed minimum wage which is attached to the areas Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers or CPI-W, [[link]](https://lni.wa.gov/workers-rights/wages/minimum-wage/history-of-washington-states-minimum-wage) and that the U.S. is known for its low membership of Unions. [[link]](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/union2.nr0.htm)
- Whilst it has all the positive effects of increasing the minimum wage does, the problem is whilst adaptive to the general labor market and its median wages, it doesn't address individual sectoral downsides minimum wage might impact negatively, so whilst the average wage across an area would rise, because certain sectors cant uphold the wage for the same hours, they either cut the amount of hours or close the business.
    
    > `Research on the effects of minimum wage laws on low-wage workers suggests that the policy increases wages but can also lead to small reductions in hours and employment as employers adjust to higher costs` [[link]](https://ejournals.bib.uni-wuppertal.de/index.php/sws/article/view/538/1063) - Responding to an Increased Minimum Wage: A Mixed Methods Study of Child Care Businesses during the Implementation of Seattle's Minimum Wage Ordinance, Otten et al., 2018
    
    > `we conclude that the second wage increase to $13 reduced hours worked in low-wage jobs by 6-7 percent, while hourly wages in such jobs increased by 3 percent.` [[link]](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w23532/w23532.pdf) - Minimum Wage Increases, Wages, and Low-Wage Employment: Evidence from Seattle, Jardim et al., 2017
    
- This problem is analogous to that in the U.S, minimum wage as a federal law on the state level, that because of the varied different standards of living, a set level across the entire country has big varied economic impact, it's debatable on whether that would be net positive or negative but as the effect in general would be so big, it's safe to assume both the positive and negatives would also be big.
- The nordic model is an example of no legally set minimum wage but strong unions with sectoral bargaining meaning that even with no minimum wage laws, the minimum wage tends to hover near 60% to 70% of the average wage in Sweden. and strong labor force protections. [[link]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nordic-model.asp\#mntl-sc-block_1-0-6:~:text=There%20is%20no%20minimum%20wage%20because%20unions%20ensure%20that%20wages%20remain%20high.)

    > `Unions raise wages for all types of workers. When unionized workers are compared with similar nonunionized counterparts, analysis shows union wages are about 12 percent higher.` `Union employers, compared with similar nonunion employers: Contribute 56 percent more toward workers’ retirement, Pay 77 percent more toward workers’ health care, Provide 11 percent more toward paid vacation and holidays.

- Whilst it has all the positive effects of increasing the minimum wage does, the problem is that this results in next to no leverage for the workers in companies with no union organisation and for a country with no legal minimum wage, there's no insurance to a livable or even received wage.
## Socialised Housing
- There are two common models of Social Housing, the `Staircase Model` and the `Housing First Model`. The traditional Staircase Model requires people to obtain increasing levels of treatment and social integration (eg, get clean, get a job) before getting full-time housing. The Housing First Model in contrast works differently:
    
    > `The scheme, introduced in 2007, is called Housing First. It is built on the principle that having a permanent home can make solving health and social problems much easier. The homeless are given permanent housing on a normal lease. That can range from a self-contained apartment to a housing block with round-the-clock support. Tenants pay rent and are entitled to receive housing benefits. Depending on their income, they may contribute to the cost of the support services they receive. The rest is covered by local government.` [[link]](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/02/how-finland-solved-homelessness/)
    
      
    
- A 2020 journal published by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development covered `How Finland Ended Homelessness` where it talks about Finland changing from the staircase model to the `Housing First Model` and their differences in results.
- They found that the staircase model halved homelessness in Finland but stalled in the 1990s,
    
    > `Using the staircase approach, Finland more than halved homelessness by 1994, but then progress slowed, as shown in exhibit 1. In particular, between 2004 and 2008, the number of single homeless individuals hovered between 7,400 and 7,960. Finland's annual homeless reports attributed the stalled progress to a group of people with high support needs who were experiencing long-term homelessness, analogous to chronic homelessness in the United States (Pleace, 2017). Researchers suggested that the staircase approach can work well with those who have opted for substance abuse rehabilitation and can cope with shared housing. However, the insistence on service users being intoxicant-free and able to take control of their lives has proven to be an insuperable barrier for many homeless people with multiple problems (Tainio and Fredriksson, 2009: 188).` [[link]](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/periodicals/cityscpe/vol22num2/ch4.pdf) - A Multiple-City RCT of Housing First With Assertive Community Treatment for Homeless Canadians With Serious Mental Illness, Aubry et al., 2016
    
- They also found that starting in 2008, the "Housing First" model converted and purchased thousands of units of housing,
    
    > `A Housing First approach requires housing, and Finland set about converting shelters into apartment units and buying and constructing housing for Housing First. In 1985, Helsinki had 2,121 shelter and hostel beds, and by 2016, the number had shrunk to 52. Meanwhile, supported housing units in Helsinki grew from 127 to 1,309, and independent rental apartments for (formerly) homeless people increased from 65 to 2,433 (Y-Foundation, 2017: 30). The Y-Foundation is currently the fourth largest landlord in Finland.` [[link]](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/periodicals/cityscpe/vol22num2/ch4.pdf) - A Multiple-City RCT of Housing First With Assertive Community Treatment for Homeless Canadians With Serious Mental Illness, Aubry et al., 2016
    
- They also found that residents often performed highly visible social work,
    
    > `Because programs that house a group of clients in the same building can encounter more community resistance than scattered-site apartments, the Finns have developed elaborate strategies to combat opposition from neighbors. Tenants engage in neighborhood work, such as collecting litter or maintaining parks. In one neighborhood, residents donned safety vests and kept watch over a bus stop used by schoolchildren. Neighbors have access to a 24-hour hotline to report any problems (Y-Foundation, 2017).` [[link]](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/periodicals/cityscpe/vol22num2/ch4.pdf) - A Multiple-City RCT of Housing First With Assertive Community Treatment for Homeless Canadians With Serious Mental Illness, Aubry et al., 2016

## Food Stamps
- A 2015 paper concluded that:
    
    > "SNAP effectively alleviates food insecurity in terms of caloric, macronutrient, and micronutrient intake. Still, SNAP participants are struggling more than income-eligible and higher-income nonparticipants to meet key dietary guidelines. Future policies should ensure that this vital food assistance program addresses diet quality while reducing food insecurity."

- A 2015 report found that:
    
    > `We find that SNAP redemptions (the value of SNAP benefits redeemed by SNAP-authorized stores) had a positive average impact on county-level employment throughout the 2001 to 2014 period, with an increase of between 0.4 and 0.5 job per $10,000 of additional SNAP redemptions across all counties over the entire period.` `As expected, the impact of SNAP redemptions on employment was greater during the recession period (2008 to 2010) than either the pre-recession period (2001 to 2007) or the postrecession period (2011 to 2014) in both nonmetro and metro counties. In the recession period, SNAP redemptions contributed to about 1.0 job per $10,000 of additional SNAP redemptions in nonmetro counties and about 0.4 job per $10,000 of additional SNAP redemptions in metro counties.` [[link]](https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/93169/err-263.pdf?v=1509.3) - The Impacts of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Redemptions on County-Level Employment, United States Department of Agriculture and Pender, 2019
    
- A 2017 study found that:
    
    > `The SEBTC SNAP demonstration provided SNAP-like benefits in the summer to households <185% of the federal poverty limit with children receiving the school food programs during the school year.

- A 2016 paper concluded that:
    
    > `Majority of vendors from each market did believe that SNAP increased sales, but the percentage of increased sales is generally not higher than 5 percent. A potentially more crucial impact of the program is an increase in customer base, and fewer vendors in each market saw their customer base increase due to SNAP acceptance. Still, a majority of vendors did feel that the customer base has increased, that number could rise if the amount of promotional materials increased, drawing in new market customers.` [[link]](https://scholarworks.uark.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1002&context=scwkuht) - Analysis of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Programs in Farmers' Markets, Thomas, 2016

## Unemployment benefits
### US Unemployment Insurance
- A 2017 paper found that `This paper has taken advantage of a discontinuity in the Austrian UI system and identified a positive UI effect on re-employment wages. We argue that the magnitude of this UI wage effect is economically meaningful from both an individual and a social perspective. The magnitude of the effect is consistent with rational behavior of an agent who extends her unemployment by being more selective in her job search, knowing that this can help secure a lasting wage gain upon reemployment. Moreover, from a social perspective, the UI wage effect implies a considerable positive fiscal externality.` [[link]](https://sci-hub.ee/10.1257/aer.20150528)
- A 2020 paper found that `We use LEHD data and find that match quality explains 35% of the increased wages due to more generous UI, while employer quality can explain almost 50% of the wage increase from UI. By contrast, we find that sorting is not much affected by more generous UI benefits. Consistent with both improved matches and employer quality, we find that extended UI benefit duration increases the likelihood of remaining in the job one year later, thus increasing job stability. In total, the increase in wages and the increase in job stability would imply an increase in earnings of $4,593 due to the increased generosity in UI benefit duration.` [[link]](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w27574/w27574.pdf)
### UK Universal Credit & Jobseekers Allowance

### European Union
- A 2011 paper found that `While the OLS analysis revealed the presence of a moderate correlation between social welfare spending and immigration from non-EU origins, the IV and GMM estimates indicate that the causal effect is smaller and statistically insignificant, thereby rejecting the welfare magnet hypothesis. All estimates for EU immigrants are essentially zero, which suggests that immigration within the EU does not respond to unemployment benefit incentives.` [[link]](https://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&context=lew2012)
# Economic Funding/Growth
## Keynesian Economics
### Deficit Spending
- Deficit Spending is when a government's expenditures exceed its revenues during a fiscal period, causing it to run a budget deficit. The phrase "deficit spending" often implies a Keynesian approach to economic stimulus, in which the government takes on debt while using its spending power to create demand and stimulate the economy.

## Progressive Income Tax
- A progressive income tax is a tax on income in which the tax rate increases as the taxable amount increases.
### 1979 Thatcher Tax Cuts
- In the first budget after her election victory in 1979, the top rate was reduced from 83% to 60% and the basic rate from 33% to 30%. [link]
- The Thatcher Poll tax was a system of taxation introduced by Margaret Thatcher‘s government in 1989/90. It provided for a single flat-rate, per-capita tax on every adult, at a rate set by the local authority. People in employment had to pay 100% of the tax, while students and the registered unemployed paid 20% of the tax. [link]
- UK unemployment rose after the poll tax was implemented and lowered after it was removed by John Major in 1993 and  
    replaced with council tax. March 1990: 6.9%, March 1993: 10.5%. [link]  
    
- UK GDP fell to stagnant and negative levels after the poll tax was implemented and flowed after it was removed by John Major in 1993 and replaced with council tax. [link]

### 2001 Bush Tax Cuts
- Bush’s tax bills (`Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001` and `Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003`) reduced the marginal income tax rate from 39.6% to 35%.
- In 2017, a Center on Budget and Policy Priorities report found that,
    
    > `Job growth, economic growth, and small business job creation were much weaker following the George W. Bush tax cuts, which gave the biggest boosts to high-income households, than after the Clinton tax increases on high-income households.` [[link]](https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/tax-cuts-for-the-rich-arent-an-economic-panacea-and-could-hurt-growth) - Tax Cuts for the Rich Aren’t an Economic Panacea — and Could Hurt Growth, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, 2017
    
    > `After the Bush tax cuts for the very highest-income households expired at the end of 2012, the economy continued to grow and add jobs steadily.` [[link]](https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/tax-cuts-for-the-rich-arent-an-economic-panacea-and-could-hurt-growth) - Tax Cuts for the Rich Aren’t an Economic Panacea — and Could Hurt Growth, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, 2017
    
    > `The Bush tax cuts included sharp tax cuts on capital gains and dividends that proponents said would spur immediate business growth, but a recent study found “empirical evidence that the 2003 tax cuts had little impact on investment or employment.” And, in the words of The Wall Street Journal, Federal Reserve economists found the 2003 tax cut "was a dud when it came to boosting the stock market.”` [[link]](https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/tax-cuts-for-the-rich-arent-an-economic-panacea-and-could-hurt-growth) - Tax Cuts for the Rich Aren’t an Economic Panacea — and Could Hurt Growth, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, 2017
    
    > `The drag from deficit-increasing tax cuts for the wealthy on the economy is a key reason why the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that allowing the high-income Bush tax cuts to expire and using the savings to cut the deficit would improve long-term economic growth.` [[link]](https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/tax-cuts-for-the-rich-arent-an-economic-panacea-and-could-hurt-growth) - Tax Cuts for the Rich Aren’t an Economic Panacea — and Could Hurt Growth, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, 2017
    
### 2017 Trump Tax Cuts
- On his first day in office, Trump reversed a middle class tax cut in mortgage insurance premiums issued by the Federal Housing Administration. These insurance fees are effectively a tax on middle-class homeownership. For a mortgage worth $200,000, this adds $500 to a homebuyer’s annual costs. [[link]](https://theintercept.com/2017/01/20/on-his-first-day-in-office-trump-raises-taxes-on-middle-class-homebuyers/)
- Trump's tax proposal (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017) would reduce the corporate tax rate to 20% from 35%. The Trump Treasury Department released a one-page summary of the nearly 500-page Senate tax bill that suggested the tax cut would more than pay for itself, based on an assumption of higher economic growth than any independent analysis had forecast. [[link]](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/11/us/politics/treasury-tax.html) Every detailed, independent analysis found that the enacted tax cut would increase budget deficits. [[link]](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/15/business/economy/survey-trump-economy.html)
- The CBO estimated in April 2018 that implementing the Act would add an estimated $2.289 trillion to the national debt over ten years. [[link]](https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/115th-congress-2017-2018/reports/53651-outlook.pdf\#page=133)
- Analysis conducted by The New York Times in November 2019 found that average business investment was lower after the tax cut than before, and that firms receiving larger tax relief increased investment less than firms receiving smaller tax relief. The analysis also found that since the tax cut firms increased dividends and stock buybacks by nearly three times as much as they increased capital investments. [[link]](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/17/business/how-fedex-cut-its-tax-bill-to-0.html)
- A study found ‘379 large, profitable U.S. companies in 2018 paid an effective tax rate of 11.3%’, the first year the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was in force. That's slightly more than half of the nominal corporate tax rate of 21%, which itself was reduced by the TCJA from a previous rate of 35%. [[link]](https://itep.org/corporate-tax-avoidance-in-the-first-year-of-the-trump-tax-law/)
- Trump’s Treasury Department has been on record for Deleted Research That Contradicts Republicans on Tax Reform. `In an interview on Fox News last month, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin made a sales pitch for the GOP’s tax reform plan—specifically, its plan to cut corporate taxes. `Most economists believe that over 70 percent of corporate taxes are paid for by the workers,` he said. His implication, in layman's terms: Regular workers would get 70 percent of the benefit of corporate tax cuts.` [[link]](https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2017/10/trumps-treasury-department-deleted-research-that-contradicts-republicans-on-tax-reform/)
- Another study found 83% of the benefits of the Trump tax bill will go to the top 1%.
    - `We find the bill would reduce taxes on average for all income groups in both 2018 and 2025.` ` On average, in 2027 taxes would change little for lower- and middle-income groups and decrease for higher-income groups. Compared to current law, 5 percent of taxpayers would pay more tax in 2018, 9 percent in 2025, and 53 percent in 2027.` [[link]](https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/distributional-analysis-conference-agreement-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act)
### General Papers on Taxation Effects
- A 1983 paper found that:
    
    > `The rapid increases in Swedish payroll taxes, occurring especially during the 70s, were presumably based on the notion of backward shifting. The evidence given in this paper suggests that the payroll tax increases were partly shifted back as lower wage increases, but that this shifting was far from complete. The estimates indicate that about 50 percent of a payroll tax increase was directly shifted back within one year.` [[link]](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/94678/1/wp068.pdf) - Payroll Taxes and Wage Inflation: The Swedish Experience, Holmlund, 1983
    
- A 1987 paper found that:
    
    > `Our principal conclusions are two. First, while the introduction of an actuarially fair Social Security system leads to a significant increase in lifetime consumption and welfare, accompanied by a reduction in the capital stock, the gain is reduced-and in some cases eliminated-in the presence of realistic restrictions on borrowing. Extending the model to general equilibrium, we find that the partial-equilibrium gains in lifetime welfare from participation in Social Security are offset by the interaction of higher steady-state interest rates and binding liquidity constraints. Indeed, the steady-state welfare cost of Social Security under proportional payroll tax finance can be substantial. Second, replacing the proportional payroll tax with a progressive tax (essentially a linear tax with an exemption), we show that age-specific tax schemes can restore much of the potential gain from participating in Social Security.` [[link]](https://sci-hub.ee/https://www.jstor.org/stable/1814536) - Social Security and Individual Welfare: Precautionary Saving, Borrowing Constraints, and the Payroll Tax, Hubbard and Judd, 1987
    
- A 2001 paper found that:
    
    > `Using longitudinal data over the 80s, and comparing years of increasing minimum costs with years of decreasing minimum costs, we show the negative effect of minimum cost increases on the employment of minimum wage workers. Our estimates, based on a difference-indifference, approach suggest that the elasticity of labor demand is roughly equal to –1.5 for this group. A similar analysis of the re-employment impact of tax subsidies gives small and insignificant positive effects on minimum wage workers. In fact, it seems that all workers in the tax subsidy zone benefit from the cost decreases.` [[link]](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/21065/1/dp219.pdf) - The impact of differential payroll tax subsidies on minimum wage employment, Kramarz and Philippon, 2001
    
- A 2000 paper found that:
    
    > `Our estimates imply that a country contemplating a move to full experience rating might expect UI claim rates to fall between 10 and 33 percent, and the seasonality of this rate to fall 16–40 percent. Similarly, a drop of about 11 percent in the seasonal range of employment would be predicted. These results clearly suggest that experience rating reduces UI claims and stabilizes employment. Both of these changes mean lower unemployment and, thus, likely higher social welfare.` [[link]](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1016/s0047-2727(99)00112-7) - The effects of the unemployment insurance payroll tax on wages, employment, claims and denials, Anderson and Meyer, 2000
    
- A 2007 paper found that:
    
    > `The evidence indicates that there may be a link between progressive taxes and higher revenues and a more equitable income distribution. The link to portfolio flows, output volatility, and growth is ambiguous. Progressive taxation does appear to be associated with larger budget deficits, but a VAT does not bring salvation. Specifically, a higher VAT is associated with more volatility. When VAT levels are considered in combination with progressive taxes, a high VAT and progressive taxation provide high revenue and high volatility, whereas the opposite is true for low VAT and progressive taxation.` [[link]](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1177%2F0486613407305286) - The Benefits of Progressive Taxation in Economic Development, Weller, 2007
    
- A 2009 paper found that:
    
    > `We do find significant estimates of positive wage effects; the wage incidence is on average 1/4 of the payroll tax reduction. This result is also in line with previous empirical research. Our results are consistent with the interpretation that in the wage bargaining process the employers and the unions treat the cost reduction as a windfall gain which they split among themselves. That the employers are able to reap 75 percent of the gain indicates that their bargaining power markedly exceeds that of the unions.` [[link]](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/45771/1/578827638.pdf) - Do regional payroll tax reductions boost employment?, Bennmarker et al., 2009

- A 2012 paper found that:
    
    > `In this paper, we estimate jointly the gross labor income responses to marginal and average tax rates for both income and payroll tax schedules. To identify the responses to the payroll tax schedule, we use the changes in the employer payroll tax reduction for low-paid jobs that occurred in France over the period 2003-2006. To identify the responses to the income tax schedule, we use the increase in working tax credit for low wage earners that took place over the same period. We find a significant elasticity of gross labor income with respect to the marginal net-of-income-tax rate around 0.2 and our results suggest that this effect is driven by married women’s labor supply decisions. Conversely, we find no significant effect of marginal net-of-payroll-tax rates on gross labor income. This discrepancy appears robust across specifications and sample selections. It is in contradiction with the prediction of identical responses to income tax and to payroll tax reforms that is common to a large class of labor market models, in particular the competitive labor supply framework, which is central in the optimal income taxation literature` [[link]](https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/file/index/docid/856246/filename/12-017.pdf) - Labor Income Responds Differently to Income-Tax and Payroll-Tax Reforms, Lehmann et al., 2012
    
- A 2013 paper found that:
    
    > `This paper studies whether large-scale payroll tax reductions for employers of young workers is an effective means to raise youth employment. In 2007–08, payroll taxes in Sweden were cut with 11 percentage points for employers of workers at 19–25 years of age. We estimate the effect of this substantial tax cut to be, at most, an employment increase at around 2.7 percent. We find no employment effect of an extension of the original reductions, implemented in 2009. Shifting of the tax cut onto workers in the form of higher wages cannot explain the modest employment effect: the size of the wage adjustments in the wake of the reform is small, at roughly one percent. The employment and wage estimates in combination imply that the elasticity of demand for young workers in Sweden is at around −0.31. Using a different metric: the estimated cost per created job for 19–25 year-olds was SEK 1.0 to 1.6 million ($150,000 to $240,000). Since we are likely to overestimate the employment increase, these figures are most likely overly optimistic. We conclude that targeted payroll tax cuts are an expensive way to boost employment for young individuals.` [[link]](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/106281/1/775177512.pdf) - Do payroll tax cuts raise youth employment?, Egebark and Kaunitz, 2013
    
- A 2019 paper found that:

In the last two decades, a number of states have cut taxes deeply in hopes of spurring economic gains, with unimpressive results. That’s not surprising given that the preponderance of the peer-reviewed academic studies indicate that state and local personal income tax levels do not affect economic performance.  
    >   
    > Rather than bet their futures on a tax-cutting approach that has not worked well in the past, states would do better to concern themselves with improving their schools, transportation networks, and other public services that act as building blocks of economic growth.`

## Multilateral & Liberalized Trade
### Liberalization of Trade
- A 2004 paper found that:
    
    > `Theory provides a strong presumption that trade liberalization will be poverty-alleviating in the long run and on average. The empirical evidence broadly supports this view, and, in particular, lends no support to the position that trade liberalization generally has an adverse impact.` [[link]](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1257/002205104773558056) - Trade Liberalization and Poverty: The Evidence So Far, Winters et al., 2004
    
- A 2006 World Bank paper found that:

- A 2008 World Bank paper found that:
    
    > `Over the 1950–98 period, countries that liberalized their trade regimes experienced average annual growth rates that were about 1.5 percentage points higher than before liberalization. Postliberalization investment rates rose 1.5–2.0 percentage points, confirming past findings that liberalization fosters growth in part through its effect on physical capital accumulation. Liberalization raised the average trade to GDP ratio by roughly 5 percentage points, after controlling for year effects, suggesting that trade policy liberalization did indeed raise the actual level of openness of liberalizers.` [[link]](http://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/660841468162283031/pdf/775730JRN020080alization0and0Growth.pdf) - Trade Liberalization and Growth: New Evidence, Wacziarg and Welch, 2008
    
- A 2014 literature review found that:
    
    > `The literature of the past decade reinforces the presumption that trade liberalization generally raises average incomes (i.e., boosts economic growth temporarily), and shows that the response to trade liberalization is likely to vary with a series of complementary conditions, many of which refer to the ease with which factors of production can migrate between sectors.`[[link]](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1146/annurev-resource-110713-105054) - Trade Liberalization and Poverty: What Have We Learned in a Decade?, Winters and Martuscelli, 2014

### Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership
- The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) was a proposed trade agreement between the European Union and the United States.
- The TTIP would have increased the EU's economy by €120 billion, the US's economy by €90 billion, and the rest of the world by €100 billion, this would translate to an extra €545 in disposable income per family in the EU, and €655 per family in the US.

### Trans-Pacific Partnership
- The now dead, Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP) was a proposed trade agreement between Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, Vietnam, and the United States signed on 4 February 2016. After the newly elected US president Donald Trump withdrew the US signature from TPP in January 2017, the agreement could not be ratified as required and did not enter into force. The remaining countries negotiated a new trade agreement called Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, which incorporates most of the provisions of the TPP and which entered into force on 30 December 2018.
- In 2016, the U.S. International Trade Commission report on its projection of the TPP was positive on all fronts.
    
    > Economy-Wide effects, `the TPP Agreement would increase annual U.S. GDP in 2032 relative to the 2032 baseline by $42.7 billion in 2017 dollars, or by 0.15 percent of total U.S. GDP` [[link]](https://www.usitc.gov/publications/332/pub4607.pdf) - Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement: Likely Impact on the U.S. Economy and on Specific Industry Sectors, United States International Trade Commission, 2016
    
    > Broad Sector Level Effects, `While output and employment would increase in the overall economy due to TPP, this change would be driven by expansion in the agriculture and food sector and the services sector.

- In 2016, the Office of the Chief Economist at Global Affairs Canada found that,
    
    > `Joining the TPP would provide a net advantage to Canada resulting from increased market access and greater regional economic integration with Asia-Pacific countries. Should Canada choose to be a party to the TPP Agreement, this is projected to boost Canada’s GDP by a permanent 0.127 percent above baseline performance, generating GDP gains of $4.3 billion (US$3.3 billion) in the longer term (by 2040).` [[link]](https://www.international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/economist-economiste/analysis-analyse/tpp_ei-re_ptp.aspx?lang=eng) - Economic Impact of Canada’s Potential Participation in the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement, 2021

### Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership
- The Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), is a trade agreement among Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, and Vietnam. It evolved from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which never entered into force due to the withdrawal of the United States.
- In 2018, the Office of the Chief Economist at Global Affairs Canada found that,
    
    > `Joining the CPTPP is expected to provide a net advantage to Canada resulting from increased market access and greater regional economic integration with Asia-Pacific countries. The CPTPP is projected to boost Canada’s GDP by $4.2 billion in the longer term (i.e. by 2040). This is significantly higher than the GDP gains of $3.4 billion that were projected under the TPP that included the United States. This increase in GDP is driven by increases in exports of goods and services, and by increases in investment.` [[link]](https://www.international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/cptpp-ptpgp/impact-repercussions.aspx?lang=eng) - Economic impact of Canada’s participation in the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, 2018
    
### North American Free Trade Agreement
- The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was an agreement signed by Canada, Mexico, and the United States that created a trilateral trade bloc in North America.
- A 2001 Paper found that:
    
    > `U.S. real gross domestic product (GDP) fell slightly from 1990 to 1991, but grew steadily from 1992 onward, coinciding with the implementation of NAFTA` `The mainstream forecasts during the NAFTA debate were basically correct: NAFTA has had relatively small positive effects on the U.S. economy and relatively large positive effects on Mexico. ` [[link]](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.15.1.125) - The Impact of NAFTA on the United States, Burfisher et al., 2001

### United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement
- United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA) is a free trade agreement between Canada, Mexico, and the United States which replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
- In 2019, the U.S. International Trade Commission report found that:
    
    > `The Commission’s model estimates that USMCA would raise U.S. real GDP by $68.2 billion (0.35 percent) and U.S. employment by 176,000 jobs (0.12 percent). The model estimates that USMCA would likely have a positive impact on U.S. trade, both with USMCA partners and with the rest of the world. U.S. exports to Canada and Mexico would increase by $19.1 billion (5.9 percent) and $14.2 billion (6.7percent), respectively.` [[link]](https://www.usitc.gov/publications/332/pub4889.pdf) - U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement: Likely Impact on the U.S. Economy and on Specific Industry Sectors, United States and International Trade Commission, 2019
    
# Workers Rights
## Unions
- A 2003 paper found that:
    
    > `Unions raise wages of unionized workers by roughly 20% and raise compensation, including both wages and benefits, by about 28%, Unions reduce wage inequality because they raise wages more for low- and middle-wage workers than for higher-wage workers, more for blue-collar than for white-collar workers, and more for workers who do not have a college degree, Strong unions set a pay standard that nonunion employers follow. For example, a high school graduate whose workplace is not unionized but whose industry is 25% unionized is paid 5% more than similar workers in less unionized industries. The impact of unions on total nonunion wages is almost as large as the impact on total union wages. The most sweeping advantage for unionized workers is in fringe benefits. Unionized workers are more likely than their nonunionized counterparts to receive paid leave, are approximately 18% to 28% more likely to have employer-provided health insurance, and are 23% to 54% more likely to be in employer-provided pension plans. Unionized workers receive more generous health benefits than nonunionized workers. They also pay 18% lower health care deductibles and a smaller share of the costs for family coverage. In retirement, unionized workers are 24% more likely to be covered by health insurance paid for by their employer. • Unionized workers receive better pension plans. Not only are they more likely to have a guaranteed benefit in retirement, their employers contribute 28% more toward pensions. • Unionized workers receive 26% more vacation time and 14% more total paid leave (vacations and holidays).` [[link]](https://files.epi.org/page/-/old/briefingpapers/143/bp143.pdf) - How unions help all workers, Mishel and Walters, 2003
    
- A 2011 report found that:
    
    > `The social democratic countries (Figure 6) have consistently high levels of union coverage (dashed line) and union membership (solid line). Coverage rates were flat or even rising in all four countries. Membership rates, which are nearly as high as coverage rates, changed little or fell slightly.` `The liberal market economies (Figure 8) generally have relatively low unionization rates and these rates have declined in every one of these countries.` [[link]](https://cepr.net/documents/publications/unions-oecd-2011-11.pdf) - Politics Matter.

In the final specification, RTW laws are used as an instrument for unionisation to recover causal effects. Results The Local Average Treatment Effect of a 1% decline in unionisation attributable to RTW is about a 5% increase in the rate of occupational fatalities. In total, RTW laws have led to a 14.2% increase in occupational mortality through decreased unionisation. [[link]](https://oem.bmj.com/content/early/2018/06/13/oemed-2017-104747)

    - Looks at a UBI experiment in Finland
    - “According to the analysis of the register data, basic income recipients were no better or worse at finding employment than those in the control group during the first year of the experiment, and in this respect there are no statistically significant differences between the groups. The recipients of basic income had half a day more of employment in the open labour market than the control group.”

    - Looks at UBI experiments in Canada and the USA
    - "Few adverse effects have been found to date. Those adverse effects found, such as work response, are smaller than would have been expected without experimentation."

    - Talks about a UBI experiment in the 70s in Canada
    - “The initial results are striking: the vast majority of Mincome participants kept working.”
    - “Primary wage earners worked a little less, but only slightly.”
    - “Married women backed off too, but mostly to take longer maternity leaves.”
    - “There was a drop in work by teenage boys, but Forget says many simply were able to stay in high school longer. Their families weren’t as desperate for another breadwinner.”

    - Look at a welfare program in Brazil
    - “In sum, our results do not show significant effects of the Brazilian CCT programmes on either the labour market participation or the supply of hours of men and women. Rather, our results seem to be compatible with a story that CCT programmes do not affect the labour supply of adult males and females. In fact, this contention seems to be in line with the empirical literature that uses individual data and compare treatment and control groups’ outcomes.”

    - Study in Uganda where they give $150 in business grants
    - “These results show that a package of $150 cash ($375 in PPP terms), five days of business training, and ongoing supervision led to a doubling of new non-farm enterprises and a significant rise in incomes among extremely poor and conflict-affected villagers, most of whom were women who had never operated such an enterprise before.
