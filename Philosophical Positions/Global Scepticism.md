## Global Scepticism
‘’What if everything around us is a fiction and what that entails?’’
The argument of Global Skepticism in logical form
- P1: Either one cannot be sure one is not being deceived by an evil demon or else one knows that one is not being deceived by an evil demon.
- P2: Such perceptual knowledge requires that one knows that one is not being deceived by one evil demon in the first place.
- P3: One cannot be sure one is being deceived.
- C1: One cannot have infallible knowledge on the external world.
- Note: ‘Evil Demon’ is used as an example of a global skepticism argument
Global Skepticism is an argument of epistemic flaws with how we interpret knowledge, not how the metaphysics and what is the world like, not undermining the existence of the world but undermining our ability to know. It also has no relation to ontology as this question is predicated on the root of this question as ontology is all the things that exist in the world.
Example Arguments:
- Brain in a Vat
- Descartes Method of Doubt
    - How do I know I'm not in a dream?
    - Descartes solution was God, ‘’God guarantees no deception’’
- Evil Demon Problem
    - Extreme version of Descartes argument, ideas planted by a demon
- The Matrix
Kant's Response was it's true we don't know things in and of themselves, and because of this, we confined ourselves to perception, We accept that because all we have are our subjective experiences and then we derive objectivity. To go ‘beyond’ our experiences is fundamentally meaningless because of the context of what experience is. A parallel is to the question of God's existence.
G.E. Moore Response called dogmatism, ‘i have a hand’, our immediate intuitions and experiences overturn the question of global skepticism
Chalmers structuralism solution.
- Chalmers applies functionalism to the question of global skepticism.
- Ramsey-Carnap-Lewis method describes a method of which you substitute an object in the real worlds to a phenomenon of which plays the roll of that object while not committing to the idea of that object in the real world, for example, rather than saying ‘there is a water bottle in the real world’, you say, ‘there exists a property in the world that plays a roll of a water bottle’ which are equivalent statements.
- Applying that to the Brain in a Vat scenario would be the wires involved in the brain in a vat would be equivalent to the brain working as we understand it. This says we don't have knowledge of the real world, instead we have knowledge of the structure of the world posed in the brain in a vat scenario, this means you don't have to sacrifice all knowledge as the structure is the same because the causal relationships are the same.
Pryors Response to Skepticism in ‘The Skeptic and the Dogmatist’
- Nowadays, it’s standard to present the skeptic’s reasoning in something like the following form. Let “you are being deceived by an evil demon” mean that your perceptual experiences are false appearances presented to you by an evil demon.(You need not accept the false appearances, to be “deceived” in this sense.) Let “you are in a position to know p” mean that you possess some justification G for believing p, and if you were to believe p on the basis of G, the belief so formed would count as knowledge. Then the skeptic’s argument goes:
- (1) You are not in a position to know you’re not being deceived by an evil demon right now.
- (2) If you’re to know anything about the external world on the basis of your current perceptual experiences, then you have to be in a position to know that you’re not being deceived by an evil demon right now.
- (3) So, by modus tollens, you can’t know anything about the external world on the basis of your current perceptual experiences.
- Very roughly, premise (1) is motivated by the thought that no amount of perceptual experience could enable you to determine whether or not you’re being deceived by an evil demon, since you’d be having exactly the same experiences even if you were being so deceived. Premise (2) is usually motivated by appeal to some sort of Closure Principle. The skeptic claims that, if you’re to know that things are the way they perceptually appear, then—since things wouldn’t be that way if your experiences were false appearances presented to you by an evil demon—you must be in a position to know that your experiences are not false appearances presented to you by an evil demon
Davis Lewis contexualists solution - to read up on [[link]](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/contextualism-epistemology/\#ECSke)
Rems solution from davidson, the charitibility solution
- What is the principle of charity [[link]](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/davidson/\#RadiInte)
    - The principle can be seen as combining two notions:
        - a rationality in belief (‘coherence’)
        - A causal relatedness between beliefs especially perceptual beliefs and the objects of belief (‘correspondence’)
    - Beliefs as a secondary characteristic are dependent on other true beliefs making the majority of our beliefs true beliefs.
- An argument for the principle
    - Statements of fact are dependent on many other beliefs, example being if the statement ‘the battle is white’, this entails true belief on the appearance of the color white, the components of a bottle, the individual beliefs of these components etc. this does not entail justification in those beliefs
- Why the principle cant be true alongside global skepticism
    - As skepticism also entails other true beliefs, we have to presume it adopts the principle of charity or most beliefs are false meaning the beliefs we have that are true don't have content to other beliefs. If the principle is true that most of our beliefs are true beliefs and its true that global skepticism is the belief of most our beliefs are false, then we have a contradiction.
    - If skepticism is true then the content stated in skepticism has no context to refer itself to be true as most beliefs would be false, therefore meaningless.
My solution by Reductio ad Absurdum
- P1: if Global skepticism is true, then there are no true beliefs in context to the external world.
- P2: If there are no true beliefs in context to the external world, then the context of global skepticism would be false.
- P3: So either we reject the Global Skepticism argument or there's no reason to believe the Global Skepticism argument.
- P4: So we reject the Global Skepticism argument.
- C1: So Global Skepticism is false.
