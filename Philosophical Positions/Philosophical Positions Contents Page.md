## Types of Naturalism
Philosophical Naturalism
- A central thought on this is that all spatio temporal entities must be identical to or metaphysically constituted by physical entities. Many ontological naturalists thus adopt a physicalist attitude to mental, biological, social and other such “special” subject matters. They hold that there is nothing more to the mental, biological and social realms than arrangements of physical entities.
- This results in what they call `empirical` statements which are inductive in nature. This is applied globally making this position basically epistemic nihilism because this theory does not accept the analytic-synthetic distinction or the a priori-a posteriori distinction which are vital to fundamental objectivity to avoid complete relativism. Hulme would say the `laws of nature` are not things in the world, they are psychological tools in which we live our daily lives. Causality isn't a thing to be observed, it's an observation in which we inductively tie together events that i just call causality.

Methodological Naturalism
- Methodological Naturalism is the specific claim that philosophy and science are both concerned to establish synthetic knowledge about the natural world, and moreover to achieve this by a posteriori investigation. From the methodological naturalist perspective, then, philosophical views are synthetic claims that answer to the overall tribunal of a posteriori observational evidence. The obvious objection to this view, however, is that it does not accord with philosophical practice. In particular, it seems in tension with the central role that intuitions play in philosophy. The typical way to assess philosophical views is arguably to test them against intuitive judgements about possible cases, not against a posteriori observational data. So, for example, the description theory of names is challenged by our intuitions about Kripke’s imagined counterexamples, the tripartite theory of knowledge by our intuitive reactions to Gettier cases, and so on. At first pass, this certainly suggests that philosophy is centrally concerned with the analysis of everyday concepts, not the construction of synthetic theories: it is using intuitions about possible cases to uncover the structure implicit in our concepts. The reliance on intuitions thus argues that, far from delivering synthetic a posteriori knowledge, philosophy uses a priori methods to deliver analytic conclusions.

## Mathematical Realism
Mathematical realism holds that mathematical entities exist independently of the human mind. Thus humans do not invent mathematics, but rather discover it, and any other intelligent beings in the universe would presumably do the same. In this point of view, there is really one sort of mathematics that can be discovered; triangles, for example, are real entities, not the creations of the human mind.
### Platonism
Mathematical anti-realism generally holds that mathematical statements have truth-values, but that they do not do so by corresponding to a special realm of immaterial or non-empirical entities. Major forms of mathematical anti-realism include formalism and fictionalism.

## Set Theory
`Set theory is the foundation of mathematics. All mathematical concepts are defined in terms of the primitive notions of set and membership. In axiomatic set theory we formulate a few simple axioms about these primitive notions in an attempt to capture the basic "obviously true" set-theoretic principles. From such axioms, all known mathematics may be derived.` [link](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/bafykbzacebyuhltlejphpgrmwn6jbwvqdocfleyea5nzpz4aqkb2t73mgshqo?filename=%28Studies%20in%20Logic%20and%20the%20Foundations%20of%20Mathematics%20102%29%20Kenneth%20Kunen%20-%20Set%20Theory.%20An%20Introduction%20to%20Independence%20Proofs-North%20Holland%20%281980%29.pdf)
### Naive Set Theory
Naive set theory, unlike axiomatic set theories, which are defined using formal logic, is defined informally, in natural language. It describes the aspects of mathematical sets familiar in discrete mathematics and suffixes for the everyday use of set theory concepts in contemporary mathematics.
### Russell's Paradox
The paradox arises within naïve set theory by considering the set of all sets that are not members of themselves. Such a set appears to be a member of itself if and only if it is not a member of itself. Hence the paradox.
Some sets, such as the set of all teacups, are not members of themselves. Other sets, such as the set of all non-teacups, are members of themselves. Call the set of all sets that are not members of themselves “R.” If R is a member of itself, then by definition it must not be a member of itself. Similarly, if R is not a member of itself, then by definition it must be a member of itself.
### Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory
Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory with the Axiom of Choice included, is the standard form of axiomatic set theory and as such is the most common foundation of modern mathematics.
