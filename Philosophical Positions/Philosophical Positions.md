## Epistemic Realism vs Anti-Realism
Anti-Realism in any regard Is an epistemic claim, this includes and is not limited to ontology, Morality, Science, and Maths topic belief on realism. Anti-realism is defined as there is no reason for belief in ‘x’ and ‘x’ meaning the specific topic of realism we want to talk about. Specifically epistemic realism refers to epistemic reasons for belief. Realism and epistemic conversations are usually entailed with negative arguments, This meaning that you argue from one position and show some internal inconsistencies making the alternative the only option.
Argument for Epistemic Realism:
- P1: If the epistemic anti-realist is right, then there are no epistemic reasons for belief,
- P2: If there are no epistemic reasons for belief, then there is no epistemic reason to believe the epistemic anti-realist,
- P3: So, either the epistemic anti-realist is wrong or there is no epistemic reason to believe the epistemic anti-realist,
- P4: So, we should reject the epistemic anti-realist theory,
- C1: So, the epistemic realist theory is true.
As stated by the argument above, it is logically impossible to argue from an epistemic anti-realist position As your worldview devolves into rejecting the position itself by Reductio ad Absurdum (a self-contradiction) and the only alternative is to accept realism.
Quote from Paul Boghossian in ‘Knowledge of Logic’, he writes:

> `A related thought that is often mentioned in this connection has it that we can know that MPP (Modus Ponens) is truth‐preserving because we cannot conceive or imagine what a counter‐example to it might be. But the suggestion that ‘conceiving’ or ‘imagining’ is here the name for a non‐inferential capacity to detect logical, or other necessary, properties will not withstand any scrutiny. When we say that we cannot conceive a counter‐example to some general claim—for example, that all bachelors are unmarried—we do not mean that we have some imagistic, non‐propositional ability to assess whether such a case can be coherently described. What we mean is that a more or less elementary piece of reasoning shows that there cannot be any such state of affairs: if someone is a bachelor, then he is an unmarried male. If someone is an unmarried male, then he is unmarried. Therefore, any bachelor would have to be unmarried. So, there cannot be any such thing as an unmarried bachelor. Talk of ‘conceiving’ here is just a thin disguise for a certain familiar style of logical reasoning. This is not, of course, to condemn it. But it is to emphasize that its acceptability as an epistemology for logic turns on the acceptability of an inferential account more generally.`
Quote from Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, he writes:

> `If the receptivity of our mind, its power of receiving representations in so far as it is in any wise affected, is to be entitled sensibility, then the mind's power of producing representations from itself, the spontaneity of knowledge, should be called the understanding. Our nature is so constituted that our intuition can never be other than sensible; that is, it contains only the mode in which we are affected by objects. The faculty, on the other hand, which enables us to think the object of sensible intuition is the understanding. To neither of these powers may a preference be given over the other. Without sensibility no object would be given to us, without understanding no object would be thought. Thoughts without content are empty, intuitions without concepts are blind. It is, therefore, just as necessary to make our concepts sensible, that is, to add the object to them in intuition, as to make our intuitions intelligible, that is, to bring them under concepts. These two powers or capacities cannot exchange their functions. The understanding can intuit nothing, the senses can think nothing. Only through their union can knowledge arise. But that is no reason for confounding the contribution of either with that of the other; rather is it a strong reason for carefully separating and distinguishing the one from the other. We therefore distinguish the science of the rules of sensibility in general, that is, aesthetic, from the science of the rules of the understanding in general, that is, logic.`
## Necessary Conditions
A Necessary Condition is defined by its logical necessity to make core philosophical claims. Without these conditions, there would be no basis or context to philosophical claims. Such a necessary condition might be a logically necessary condition, but often in Kant’s transcendental arguments the condition is necessary in the sense that it is the only possible explanation for the premise. Reductio ad Absurdum is defined by how you can conclude an absurd statement to be false. This is identical to how Kant transcendental arguments work.
We can create a criterion in which we can find out if aspects of our philosophy are necessary or not, if the opposite is logically impossible or contradictory. For example, let's posit 3 ideas and find out if they are necessary or not, Burgers, God and Knowledge.
- Are `Burgers` Necessary? Well as a Ontological identity of a type of food, the contrapositive would be no burgers, the only thing that can't be analysed now would be burgers, there is no logical collapse following from a contradiction to remove that idea so no, burgers are not necessary.
- Is `Knowledge` Necessary? Well as a Epistemic category, the contrapositive would be no knowledge. Well without the idea of Knowledge, what would philosophy be without knowing it, nothing could be analysed, there is a collapse of the philosophical system to remove that idea so yes, Knowledge is necessary.
## A Priori and A Posteriori
In the Introduction to the Critique of Pure Reason, Kant contrasts his distinction between analytic and synthetic propositions with another distinction, the distinction between a priori and a posteriori propositions. He defines these terms as follows:
- a priori proposition: a proposition whose justification does not rely upon experience. Moreover, the proposition can be validated by experience, but is not grounded in experience. Therefore, it is logically necessary.
- a posteriori proposition: a proposition whose justification does rely upon experience. The proposition is validated by, and grounded in, experience. Therefore, it is logically contingent.
Examples of a priori propositions include:
- "All bachelors are unmarried."
- "7 + 5 = 12."
The justification of these propositions does not depend upon experience: one need not consult experience to determine whether all bachelors are unmarried, nor whether 7 + 5 = 12. (Of course, as Kant would grant, experience is required to understand the concepts "bachelor", "unmarried", "7", "+" and so forth. However, the a priori / a posteriori distinction as employed here by Kant refers not to the origins of the concepts but to the justification of the propositions. Once we have the concepts, experience is no longer necessary.)
Examples of a posteriori propositions include:
- "All bachelors are unhappy."
- "Tables exist."
Both of these propositions are a posteriori: any justification of them would require one's experience.
The analytic/synthetic distinction and the a priori / a posteriori distinction together yield four types of propositions:
- analytic a priori
- synthetic a priori
- analytic a posteriori
- synthetic a posteriori
Kant posits the third type as obviously self-contradictory. Ruling it out, he discusses only the remaining three types as components of his epistemological framework—each, for brevity's sake, becoming, respectively, "analytic", "synthetic a priori", and "empirical" or "a posteriori" propositions. This triad will account for all propositions possible. Examples of analytic and a posteriori statements have already been given, for synthetic a priori propositions he gives those in mathematics and physics.
## Analytic-Synthetic Distinction
Kant uses the terms "analytic" and "synthetic" to divide propositions into two types. Kant introduces the analytic–synthetic distinction in the Introduction to his Critique of Pure Reason. There, he restricts his attention to statements that are affirmative subject–predicate judgments and defines "analytic proposition" and "synthetic proposition" as follows:
analytic proposition: a proposition whose predicate concept is contained in its subject concept
synthetic proposition: a proposition whose predicate concept is not contained in its subject concept but related
Examples of analytic propositions, on Kant's definition, include:

> "All bachelors are unmarried."
> 
> "All triangles have three sides."
Kant's own example is:

> "All bodies are extended," that is, occupy space.
Each of these statements is an affirmative subject–predicate judgment, and, in each, the predicate concept is contained within the subject concept. The concept "bachelor" contains the concept "unmarried"; the concept "unmarried" is part of the definition of the concept "bachelor". Likewise, for "triangle" and "has three sides", and so on.
Examples of synthetic propositions, on Kant's definition, include:

> "All bachelors are alone."
> 
> "All creatures with hearts have kidneys."
Kant's own example is:

> "All bodies are heavy", that is, they experience a gravitational force.
As with the previous examples classified as analytic propositions, each of these new statements is an affirmative subject–predicate judgment. However, in none of these cases does the subject concept contain the predicate concept. The concept "bachelor" does not contain the concept "alone"; "alone" is not a part of the definition of "bachelor". The same is true for "creatures with hearts" and "have kidneys"; even if every creature with a heart also has kidneys, the concept "creature with a heart" does not contain the concept "has kidneys".
## Aesthetic-Logic Distinction
Aesthetic is defined by Kant as `The Science of the Laws of Sensibility`
Logic is defined by Kant as `The Science of the Laws of the Understanding`
## Knowledge & Scepticism
Famous Epistemologists:
- AJ (Freddie) Ayer
- Edmund Gettier

- Tim Williamson
From Scepticism to Knowledge

> Descartes suggest because of setting the bar for what we know very high, we know very little, eg 'I Exist',
solution being redefining knowledge to set a lower bar
What is Knowledge
'what is X' Questions
x might be 'truth' 'perception' 'reason' etc
seen as important in philosophy since plato and too this day
But there of multiple meaning
'When do we apply x?'
'What is a genuine case of x?'
The Concept of Knowledge
## Theories Of Truth
Truth. We want it, but why prefer truth over falsehood? Why pursue truth? There are different theories of truth.
### Correspondence Theory of Truth
Something is true if it corresponds to something that is real. This is a scientific type method of truth. Problems with this theory include a problem with perspective in regards to how something is true without my correspondence of that event or thought.
- x is true iff x corresponds to some fact; x is false iff x does not correspond to any fact.
Definitions of the theory are too narrow. Although they apply to truths from some domains of discourse, e.g., the domain of science, they fail for others, e.g. the domain of morality: there are no moral facts. The objection recognizes moral truths, but rejects the idea that reality contains moral facts for moral truths to correspond to.
Argument against the correspondence theory:
- P1: if the correspondence theory of truth is correct, then there are no moral truths
- P2: if there are no moral facts, then there are no epistemic facts.
- P3: But there are epistemic facts.
- C1: Therefore, correspondence theory of truth is incorrect.
### Coherentist Theory of Truth
Something is true if it coheres to something that is also true.
Argument:
- P1:
- P2:
- P3:
- P4:
- C1:
### Pragmatist Theory of Truth
Something is true if it is useful.
Argument:
- P1:
- P2:
- P3:
- P4:
- C1:
### Deflationism Theory without Truth
Statements with the preface of `it is true that` are removed and still serve the same purpose.
Argument:
- P1:
- P2:
- P3:
- P4:
- C1:
### Identity Theory of Truth
It sees itself as a reaction against correspondence theories of truth, which maintain that truth-bearers are made true by facts. The identity theory maintains, against this, that at least some truth-bearers are not made true by, but are identical with, facts.
Argument:
- P1:
- P2:
- P3:
- P4:
- C1:
### Nihilism Theory without Truth
Nothing is true, an ultimate skeptic about truth. Addressed in the Global Skepticism section.
## Theories Of Justification/Knowledge
The need to give a reason, your reason for that reason, and so on.
The Epistemic Regress Problem is a problem first seen when Aristotle wrote about a dialect on the topic of epistemic justification. An analogy to that dialectic is when talking to a young child, when said `were leaving the park now`, you might get the answer `why?` and answer with something like `well we have to go home` which has a response with `why?` this usually answers with` because i said so` but philosophically this can be applied to any belief you have. This can be used to argue for skepticism.
Responses to the problem are:
- Comes to an end - aka Foundationalism
    - Eventually you hit a foundational belief. These can come in the form of either an experience, unjustified belief or not in need of justification.
    - A foundational experience runs into the problem of not being a priori true so it becomes not adequate of a reason.
    - A Unjustified foundational belief is giving in to the skeptic and what they say is the correct position so it too becomes not adequate of a reason.
Argument:
- P1:
- P2:
- P3:
- P4:
- C1:
- Continues Infinitely - aka Infinitism
    - The chain of reasons continues infinitely. This begs the question of lower level beliefs in maths and has only risen in recent times and is widely rejected by skeptics and non-skeptics.
    - To conclude with a belief is to be finished with that thought and to believe this theory contradicts the nature of what concluding even means.
Argument:
- P1:
- P2:
- P3:
- P4:
- C1:
- Circles back on itself - Coherentism
    - The chain of reasons circles on itself. Coherentists deny that justification is linear. Coherentist beliefs are seens as a web of beliefs rather than a line of beliefs.
Argument:
- P1:
- P2:
- P3:
- P4:
- C1:
- Global Skepticism
    - The skeptic claims none of these options lead to genuine justification and as it applies to all of your beliefs, you have no justification in anything. Even this sentence. Addressed in the Global Skepticism section.
In a Different conversation about justification, there's a different question of the entailment of justification on things like belief and knowledge.
- Internalism
    - Knowledge requires justification and that the nature of this justification is completely determined by a subject’s internal states or reasons
- Externalism
    - Either knowledge does not require justification or the nature of justification is not completely determined by internal factors alone
## How we Gain Knowledge
### Rationalism and Empiricism
Kant's problem with Rationalism and Empiricism - [[link]](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rationalism-empiricism/)
G.W. Leibniz claimed that we could only have objective knowledge of the world uncontaminated by the point of view of any observer, a form of mind-independent objectivism. Leibniz belonged to the school of thought generally labeled ‘rationalist’ thought. Rationalism derives all claims to knowledge from the exercise of reason, and purports to give an absolute description of the world, uncontaminated by the experience of any observer. Leibnitz believed that the understanding contains within itself certain innate principles, which it knows intuitively to be true, and which form the axioms from which a complete description of the world can be derived
David Hume claimed that we could only have objective knowledge of nothing, essentially nihilism. Hume’s scepticism caused Kant some concerned things like Causality and A Priori Knowledge. Hume belonged to the school of thought generally labeled ‘empiricism’ thought. Empiricism argues that knowledge comes through experience alone; there is, therefore, no possibility of separating from the subjective condition of the knower.
Kant's response gave an answer to the question of objective knowledge that was neither as absolute as Leibnitz nor as subjective as Hume’s
### The Problem with Cogito Ergo Sum
‘Cogito Ergo Sum’ meaning ‘I think, Therefore I am’ has been expressed in many ways, Bertrand Russell highlights Descartes' service to philosophy as that of illustrating that "subjective things are the most certain." In his critique of the ‘First Principle’ Descartes holds in Russells book, ‘Problems of Philosophy’. This statement posed by Descartes wouldn't be problematic if it was regarded as just another belief but its use as a foundational principle causes some misuse of philosophy. The ‘Cogito’ shows that there is a thought, but not that there is an ‘I’ who thinks it. Kant, similarly dissatisfied with Descartes’ argument, and with the doctrine of the soul that flowed from it, felt that the certainty of self-knowledge had been wrongly described. It is true that, however sceptical I may be about the world, I cannot extend my scepticism into the subjective sphere (the sphere of consciousness): so I can be immediately certain of my present mental states. But I cannot be immediately certain of what I am, or of whether, indeed, there is an ‘I’ to whom these states belong. These furter propositions must be established by argument and had yet to be found. This is what Kant attempted to make in his first Critique of Pure Reason.
Søren Kierkegaard calls the phrase a tautology in his Concluding Unscientific Postscript. He argues that the cogito already presupposes the existence of "I", and therefore concluding with existence is logically trivial. Kierkegaard's argument can be made clearer if one extracts the premise "I think" into the premises "'x' thinks" and "I am that 'x'", where "x" is used as a placeholder in order to disambiguate the "I" from the thinking thing. Here, the cogito has already assumed the "I"'s existence as it thinks. For Kierkegaard, Descartes is merely "developing the content of a concept", namely that the "I", which already exists, thinks. As Kierkegaard argues, the proper logical flow of argument is that existence is already assumed or presupposed in order for thinking to occur, not that existence is concluded from that thinking. This concludes that ‘Cogito Ergo Sum’ as an epistemic principle is flawed but holding as a normal conceptual belief is merely a tautology.
## The Problem With ‘Axioms’
When defined by ‘A unjustified, foundational belief’, it is immediately defined as a dishonest belief to hold. A belief with no basis is not a belief one ought to hold. We ought not hold ‘A’ and ‘Not A’ as these are contradictory positions, we need reasons to hold beliefs and if reason is used to justify them, they are not axiomatic.
## Global Scepticism
‘’What if everything around us is a fiction and what that entails?’’
The argument of Global Skepticism in logical form
- P1: Either one cannot be sure one is not being deceived by an evil demon or else one knows that one is not being deceived by an evil demon.
- P2: Such perceptual knowledge requires that one knows that one is not being deceived by one evil demon in the first place.
- P3: One cannot be sure one is being deceived.
- C1: One cannot have infallible knowledge on the external world.
- Note: ‘Evil Demon’ is used as an example of a global skepticism argument
Global Skepticism is an argument of epistemic flaws with how we interpret knowledge, not how the metaphysics and what is the world like, not undermining the existence of the world but undermining our ability to know. It also has no relation to ontology as this question is predicated on the root of this question as ontology is all the things that exist in the world.
Example Arguments:
- Brain in a Vat
- Descartes Method of Doubt
    - How do I know I'm not in a dream?
    - Descartes solution was God, ‘’God guarantees no deception’’
- Evil Demon Problem
    - Extreme version of Descartes argument, ideas planted by a demon
- The Matrix
Kant's Response was it's true we don't know things in and of themselves, and because of this, we confined ourselves to perception, We accept that because all we have are our subjective experiences and then we derive objectivity. To go ‘beyond’ our experiences is fundamentally meaningless because of the context of what experience is. A parallel is to the question of God's existence.
G.E. Moore Response called dogmatism, ‘i have a hand’, our immediate intuitions and experiences overturn the question of global skepticism
Chalmers structuralism solution.
- Chalmers applies functionalism to the question of global skepticism.
- Ramsey-Carnap-Lewis method describes a method of which you substitute an object in the real worlds to a phenomenon of which plays the roll of that object while not committing to the idea of that object in the real world, for example, rather than saying ‘there is a water bottle in the real world’, you say, ‘there exists a property in the world that plays a roll of a water bottle’ which are equivalent statements.
- Applying that to the Brain in a Vat scenario would be the wires involved in the brain in a vat would be equivalent to the brain working as we understand it. This says we don't have knowledge of the real world, instead we have knowledge of the structure of the world posed in the brain in a vat scenario, this means you don't have to sacrifice all knowledge as the structure is the same because the causal relationships are the same.
Pryors Response to Skepticism in ‘The Skeptic and the Dogmatist’
- Nowadays, it’s standard to present the skeptic’s reasoning in something like the following form. Let “you are being deceived by an evil demon” mean that your perceptual experiences are false appearances presented to you by an evil demon.(You need not accept the false appearances, to be “deceived” in this sense.) Let “you are in a position to know p” mean that you possess some justification G for believing p, and if you were to believe p on the basis of G, the belief so formed would count as knowledge. Then the skeptic’s argument goes:
- (1) You are not in a position to know you’re not being deceived by an evil demon right now.
- (2) If you’re to know anything about the external world on the basis of your current perceptual experiences, then you have to be in a position to know that you’re not being deceived by an evil demon right now.
- (3) So, by modus tollens, you can’t know anything about the external world on the basis of your current perceptual experiences.
- Very roughly, premise (1) is motivated by the thought that no amount of perceptual experience could enable you to determine whether or not you’re being deceived by an evil demon, since you’d be having exactly the same experiences even if you were being so deceived. Premise (2) is usually motivated by appeal to some sort of Closure Principle. The skeptic claims that, if you’re to know that things are the way they perceptually appear, then—since things wouldn’t be that way if your experiences were false appearances presented to you by an evil demon—you must be in a position to know that your experiences are not false appearances presented to you by an evil demon
Davis Lewis contexualists solution - to read up on [[link]](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/contextualism-epistemology/\#ECSke)
Rems solution from davidson, the charitibility solution
- What is the principle of charity [[link]](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/davidson/\#RadiInte)
    - The principle can be seen as combining two notions:
        - a rationality in belief (‘coherence’)
        - A causal relatedness between beliefs especially perceptual beliefs and the objects of belief (‘correspondence’)
    - Beliefs as a secondary characteristic are dependent on other true beliefs making the majority of our beliefs true beliefs.
- An argument for the principle
    - Statements of fact are dependent on many other beliefs, example being if the statement ‘the battle is white’, this entails true belief on the appearance of the color white, the components of a bottle, the individual beliefs of these components etc. this does not entail justification in those beliefs
- Why the principle cant be true alongside global skepticism
    - As skepticism also entails other true beliefs, we have to presume it adopts the principle of charity or most beliefs are false meaning the beliefs we have that are true don't have content to other beliefs. If the principle is true that most of our beliefs are true beliefs and its true that global skepticism is the belief of most our beliefs are false, then we have a contradiction.
    - If skepticism is true then the content stated in skepticism has no context to refer itself to be true as most beliefs would be false, therefore meaningless.
My solution by Reductio ad Absurdum
- P1: if Global skepticism is true, then there are no true beliefs in context to the external world.
- P2: If there are no true beliefs in context to the external world, then the context of global skepticism would be false.
- P3: So either we reject the Global Skepticism argument or there's no reason to believe the Global Skepticism argument.
- P4: So we reject the Global Skepticism argument.
- C1: So Global Skepticism is false.
## Value of knowledge
Aristotle's view of knowledge was that it seems to be tied down and that knowledge that is came across by luck has a tendency to float away easier and faster than true knowledge. He gives an example of giving directions to a city where one person says when given the option of left and right `go left` and when asked why, they answer with `just a mere guess`. Have this compared to someone who answers the same but with better reasoning like `this is the road i took when going to the city`. In clearer terms, knowledge with good reasons can live up to scrutiny better than knowledge founded with luck as there is a more reliant path for justification to arise from when using a better form of knowledge.
Timothy Williamson's view of knowledge is `knowledge is resistant to misleading counter evidence` he gives an example of a burglar merely believing there's a diamond under the bed. Now this isn't knowledge of the diamond, just a mere belief this burglar has based on someone else telling them its location incorrectly. If they believe there's a diamond under the bed and find no diamond, they will retreat as there's no knowledge of the diamond, but if the burglar had knowledge of the diamond being where it was stated, the burglar would keep looking. This is an extension to aristotle's view of knowledge and again demonstrates the tied down nature knowledge requires to be knowledge.
What's come to be called the Meno problem is a problem in need of a solution. How can knowledge be more valuable than merely being confident in the truth when being confident in the truth leads to success when you act on it just as well as knowledge?

# Meta-Ethics
## Moral Realism vs Anti-Realism
Categorical normative reasons are normative reasons for agents to do things or have certain attitudes irrespective of their desires, aims, wants and feelings, and the roles in which they happen to find themselves. These reasons for agents to do things are ontologically and existentially independent of these agents’ desires, aims, wants, feelings and roles.
A Categorical Reason can be defined as a norm. You have epistemic norms and moral norms.
- Examples of epistemic norms
    - Correspondence Theory of Truth
    - Coherentist Theory of Knowledge
    - X theory of belief
- Examples of Moral Norms
    - Kant's categorical imperative
    - Utilitarian maximization principle
Hypothetical normative reasons are reasons for agents to do things or have certain attitudes that are not independent of these agents’ desires, aims or roles. For instance, if, but only if, you like blueberry muffins, there is a reason for you to buy some. From the moral realism position, they accept that moral statements are true by the theory of truth they hold to. Making a true moral statement makes that statement a moral fact. To deny moral realism is to deny moral fact which is to deny their own theory of truth.
### Moral Non-Cognitivism
Moral Non-Cognitivism states that moral statements are not true or false. By extension, a Non-Cognitivist says all moral statements are meaningless because they are not a fact of the world. Examples of Non-Cognitivist points are:
- If moral judgments are considered to be mental states, then noncognitivism is the denial that moral judgments are beliefs.
- If moral judgments are considered to be sentence types, then noncognitivism is the denial that moral judgments have an underlying grammar that expresses a proposition.
- If moral judgments are considered to be speech acts, then noncognitivism is the denial that moral judgments are assertions.
If you accept a theory of truth, the burden for the Non-Cognitivist is to prove how you can hold a theory of truth and not apply said theory to moral claims.
Argument for Moral realism in regards to against Moral Non-Cognitivism:
- P1: According to the Non-Cognitivist theory, there are no categorical normative reasons.
- P2: If there are no categorical normative reasons, then there are no epistemic reasons for belief.
- P3: But there are epistemic reasons for belief.
- P4: So there are categorical normative reasons.
- C1: So the Non-Cognitivism theory is false.
### Moral Error Theory
Moral Error Theory states that all moral statements are false. The moral error theorist doesn't believe in such things as moral obligation, moral value, moral desert, moral virtue, and moral permission.
Argument for Moral realism in regards to against Moral Error Theory:
- P1: According to Error Theory, all categorical normative reasons are false.
- P2: If all categorical normative reasons are false, then all epistemic reasons for belief are false.
- P3: If all epistemic reasons for belief are false, then there are no epistemic reasons for belief.
- P4: But there are epistemic reasons for belief.
- P5: So it's false that all categorical normative reasons are false.
- P6: So there are true categorical normative reasons.
- C1: So Error Theory is false.
    
    ### The Argument from Relativity
    
    The argument states that because of moral disagreement between people means that no moral fact can exist.
    
    Argument for Moral realism in regards to against The Argument from Relativity:
    
    - P1: According to The Argument from Relativity, there are no categorical normative reasons because there is moral disagreement.
    - P2: If there is disagreement with this argument, then the argument says you should accept the conclusion of not believing the argument.
    - P3: So either the argument refutes itself or the argument is false.
    - C1: So The Argument from Relativity is false.
    
    ### The Argument from Queerness
    
    This argument has two strands, an epistemic argument and a metaphysical argument.
    
    The epistemic argument states that our conception of a moral property is essentially one of a very unusual kind of property, such that countenancing its instantiation requires us to posit in the world “qualities or relations of a very strange sort, utterly different from anything else in the universe” this makes the case that morality cant be found in the real world which isn't a claim a non-naturalist realist would disagree with.
    
    The metaphysical argument states that in order to track such weird properties we would need “some special faculty of moral perception or intuition, utterly different from our ordinary ways of knowing everything else”. These conversations on morality are not mind-independent arguments, these are arguments of if it meets the bar of objectivity.
    
    The problem for the error theorist is a misconception of how moral arguments work, you can have mind-dependent arguments using mind-independant normative principles and have a coherent and deductive system.
    
    If you accept a theory of truth, the burden for the Error Theorist is to prove how you can hold a normative ethical system and make moral prescriptions and then be consistent and you can't build a coherent system on false beliefs.
    
    Mackie in context to Kant's categorical Imperative writes:
    
    > `So far as ethics is concerned, my thesis that there are no objective values is specifically the denial that any such categorically imperative element is objectively valid. The objective values which I am denying would be action-directing absolutely, not contingently (in the way indicated) upon the agent's desires and inclinations`
    
    The statement proposed implies that the categorical imperative is objectively valid by appealing to another Normative system of some type of emotivism. Mackie continues to write about supposing an example of some evaluative conclusion:
    
    > `let us suppose that we could make explicit the reasoning that supports some evaluative conclusion, where this conclusion has some action-guiding force that is not contingent upon desires or purposes or chosen ends.Then what I am saying is that somewhere in the input to this argument - perhaps in one or more of the premisses, perhaps in some part of the form of the argument - there will be something which cannot be objectively validated - some premiss which is not capable of being simply true, or some form of argument which is not valid as a matter of general logic, whose authority or cogency is not objective, but is constituted by our choosing or deciding to think in a certain way.`
    
    The realist reply to this conclusion Mackie has here …..
    
### Quasi Realism
A Quasi Realist would argue that moral truths are based in moral agreement. This falls privy to the same objections as the Error Theorists argument from relativity. A ‘fact’ based on inter-subjective agreements is entirely subjective but again this is a question of Objectivism vs Subjectivism, this presupposes realism entirely, to assert that moral facts are either objective stipulations or subjective intuitions require the belief in morality being real.
## Moral Objectivism Vs Subjectivism
### Objectivism
Moral Facts are Objective
### Subjectivism
Moral Facts are Subjective
Rems Argument Against Moral Subjectivism:
- P1: Moral disagreements are disagreements about preferences
- P2: In cases of disagreements over preferences, it's best to step back and find an impartial mediator (because neither preference can be pragmatically chosen)
- P3: In cases of moral disagreement it *isn't* the case that one should always seek an impartial mediator (e.g. disagreement over genocide)
- P4: Moral disagreement can't be disagreement over preferences
- C1: Moral subjectivism is wrong
This is a rough version of Enoch's first defense of Robust Realism. It's very compelling, but obviously the argument must be adjusted to each version of moral subjectivism (for the one described here likely doesn't exist).
Argument Against Moral Subjectivism:
- P1: According to the Moral Subjectivist theory, all Moral statements are subjective.
- P2: if all morality is subjective, then there are no moral facts.
- P3: if there are no moral facts, then there are no epistemic facts.
- P4: But there are epistemic facts.
- C1: Therefore, Moral Subjectivism is false.
## Moral Naturalism Vs Non-Naturalism
### Naturalist
investigatable like other observable properties
'bad things are bad by definition`
`pain is bad` is a tautology
Argues said tautologies are analytic statements
Is analysed like a natural science
### Non-naturalist
Rejects Naturalism,
Moore argues they commit the Naturalistic Fallacy
Argues that if naturalist statements were analytic statements, then why do you have to define it that way, meaning it seems to be a synthetic distinction, not a analytic one
Kant writes in the Critique of Pure Reason,

> ‘If the receptivity of our mind, its power of receiving representations in so far as it is in any wise affected, is to be entitled sensibility, then the mind's power of producing representations from itself, the spontaneity of knowledge, should be called the understanding. Our nature is so constituted that our intuition can never be other than sensible; that is, it contains only the mode in which we are affected by objects. The faculty, on the other hand, which enables us to think the object of sensible intuition is the understanding. To neither of these powers may a preference be given over the other. Without sensibility no object would be given to us, without understanding no object would be thought. Thoughts without content are empty, intuitions without concepts are blind. It is, therefore, just as necessary to make our concepts sensible, that is, to add the object to them in intuition, as to make our intuitions intelligible, that is, to bring them under concepts. These two powers or capacities cannot exchange their functions. The understanding can intuit nothing, the senses can think nothing. Only through their union can knowledge arise. But that is no reason for confounding the contribution of either with that of the other; rather is it a strong reason for carefully separating and distinguishing the one from the other. We therefore distinguish the science of the rules of sensibility in general, that is, aesthetic, from the science of the rules of the understanding in general, that is, logic.’
Kant writes about how just sense data makes no complete concept of knowledge without understanding (consciousness). Analytic statements are not complete by just sense data alone making the naturalist theory false.
Argument against Moral Naturalism
- P1: According to the Moral Naturalist theory, Moral Naturalism is true because of an analytical observation of morality in the external world.
- P2: if you can have a analytical observation, then it would be a posteriori analytic truth,
- P3: a posteriori analytic truth are self contradictory
- C1: Therefore, Moral Naturalism is false

My Compatibilism - that thoughts are Indeterminate and actions result from a prior cause
Thoughts have an end in respect to both the conceptual process, meaning how a thought can end while another can arise like a new topic, and the systematic process of thinking, meaning thinking can end. A person who has thoughts can cease to have thoughts, namely death.
This isn't the case for actions. Whenever we observe some action, we always have a secondary action, there never seems to be a causal closure in the observed events, only another action.
Thoughts don't carry causal reactions to each other but can have relation to other events. Even though this is the case, this doesn't make thought causal.
Actions described as free under this model would be defined as non-causal and therefore irrational.
# Philosophy of Mind
## Type/Token Distinction
`Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose.`
In one sense of ‘word’ we may count three different words; in another sense we may count ten different words. C. S. Peirce called words in the first sense “types” and words in the second sense “tokens”.

> Type: physical corresponds to a mental, two perceptions of the same event are the result of the same mind state in two different brains/people.
> 
> Subject to the Extraterrestrials/multi realizability Objection:
> 
> If there were a lifeform made of silicon bonds and humans are made of carbon bonds and those neurons which trigger those brain states are from those carbon bonds, do these silicon bond lifeforms have mental states? If yes or no, then what makes human minds so special?
> 
> Token: rather than a perception, its a concrete particular of spatio temporal existence
## Cartesian Dualism
[[link]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpfPUAyVdwo)
Mental Plane - my sensations of emotions, namely `Cartesian Egos` which are private
Physical Plane - my interactions with physical objects
Argument against, The Dread interaction problem: how does something from the mental realm interact with the physical realm? Descartes posited it was the pineal gland, an ad-hoc explanation. Leibnitz posited there are no such interactions, but that there was a pre-established harmony set in stone from the birth of creation. This would be a clockmaker argument similar to the clockmaker argument for god, again an ad-hoc explanation. Leibnitz and Descartes were theists btw, dualism usually posits God.
Or if Cartesian Egos are naturalistic states, then they exist in the physical plane making this reduce to some form of materialism/physicalism making this Cartesian Egos publicly investigatable. This is what happened in the history of philosophy of mind. The dualist majority collapsed into some form of monism, some behaviourists
The incredulous stare argument: for every mental event i have, there seems to be a correlation to a brain state i have

### The Knowledge Argument Against Physicalism - [link]
The knowledge argument is one of the main challenges to physicalism, the doctrine that the world is entirely physical. The argument begins with the claim that there are truths about consciousness that cannot be deduced from the complete physical truth.
Argument Against Physicalism
- P1: If physicalism is true, all real things are physical
- P2: Abstractions are not physical but are real
- C1: Therefore, physicalism is false. (by modus tollens)
## Psychoneural Identity Theory/Brain-Mind Identity Theory
The most famous arguments for functionalism are responses not to behaviorism but to the mind-brain identity theory. According to the identity theory, “sensations are brain processes” (Smart 1959). If mental state kinds are (identical to) kinds of brain states, then there is a one-to-one relation between mental state kinds and brain state kinds. Everything that has sensation S must have brain state B, and everything that has brain state B must have sensation S. Not only that, but this one-to-one correlation must not be accidental. It must be a law of nature, at least, and perhaps must hold with an even stronger sort of necessity. Put this way, the mind-brain identity theory seems to make a very strong claim, indeed. As Hilary Putnam notes in “The Nature of Mental States.”,

> `the physical-chemical state in question must be a possible state of a mammalian brain, a reptilian brain, a mollusc’s brain (octopuses are mollusca, and certainly feel pain), etc. At the same time, it must not be a possible (physically possible) state of the brain of any physically possible creature that cannot feel pain. Even if such a state can be found, it must be nomologically certain that it will also be a state of the brain of any extraterrestrial life that may be found that will be capable of feeling pain before we can even entertain the supposition that it may be pain.` (Putnam 1967: 436)
The obvious implication is that the mind-brain identity theory is false. Other mammals, reptiles, and mollusks can experience pain, but they do not have brains like ours. It seems to follow that there is not a one-to-one relation between sensations and brain processes, but rather a one-to-many relation. Mental states, then, are not uniquely realized (as the identity theory requires); they are instead multiply realized.
## Idealism
Everything is reduce to the mind, monism
It examines the relationship between epistemological idealism (the view that the contents of human knowledge are ineluctably determined by the structure of human thought) and ontological idealism (the view that epistemological idealism delivers truth because reality itself is a form of thought and human thought participates in it).
There have been two fundamental conceptions of idealism:
1. something mental (the mind, spirit, reason, will) is the ultimate foundation of all reality, or even exhaustive of reality,
2. although the existence of something independent of the mind is conceded, everything that we can know about this mind-independent “reality” is held to be so permeated by the creative, formative, or constructive activities of the mind (of some kind or other) that all claims to knowledge must be considered, in some sense, to be a form of self-knowledge.
Idealism in sense (1) may be called “metaphysical” or “ontological idealism”, while idealism in sense (2) may be called “formal” or “epistemological idealism”. The modern paradigm of idealism in sense (1) might be considered to be George Berkeley’s “immaterialism”, according to which all that exists are ideas and the minds, less than divine or divine, that have them. (Berkeley himself did not use the term “idealism”.) The fountainhead for idealism in sense (2) might be the position that Immanuel Kant asserted (if not clearly in the first edition of his Critique of Pure Reason (1781) then in his Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics (1783) and in the “Refutation of Idealism” in the second edition of the Critique) according to which idealism does “not concern the existence of things”, but asserts only that our “modes of representation” of them, above all space and time, are not “determinations that belong to things in themselves” but features of our own minds.
George Dicker provides a compelling initial representation of Kant’s argument:
- P1: I am conscious of my own existence in time; that is, I am aware, and can be aware, that I have experiences that occur in a specific temporal order.
- P2: I can be aware of having experiences that occur in a specific temporal order only if I perceive something permanent by reference to which I can determine their temporal order.
- P3: No conscious state of my own can serve as the permanent entity by reference to which I can determine the temporal order of my experiences.
- P4: Time itself cannot serve as this permanent entity by reference to which I can determine the temporal order of my experiences.
- P5: If P2, P3, and P4, are true, then I can be aware of having experiences that occur in a specific temporal order only if I perceive persisting objects in space outside me by reference to which I can determine the temporal order of my experiences.
- C1: Therefore, I perceive persisting objects in space outside me by reference to which I can determine the temporal order of my experiences.
**KANT’S TRANSCENDENTAL IDEALISM IS NOT THE SAME TYPE OF IDEALISM** - [[link]](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-transcendental-idealism/)
## Behaviourism
When you're in pain, you exhibit a behaviour that we classify as `being in pain` classified as a disposition of behaviour. This was devoid of metaphysics as it came from the logical positivist. The issues with this is what about a belief state? How do I go about expressing this belief in a behaviour as it is purely a mental state? A conflict of beliefs can cause behaviours to be misinterpreted or unperformable unless you rely on purely mental beliefs on things like beliefs on language making the behaviourist concede the behaviourist position as it has to posit purely mental states that aren't represented by a behaviour.
Argument Against Behaviourism
- P1: If behaviorism is true, it is not possible for there to be a perfect actor or doppelgänger who behaves just like me but has different mental states or none at all.
- P2: But it is possible for there to be a perfect actor or doppelgänger who behaves just like me but has different mental states or none at all.
- C1: Therefore, behaviorism is not true. (by modus tollens)
## Functionalism
Jumps off the Multi-Realizability Objection using Turing machine analysis. To be conscious, to exhibit some mental state, to feel being in pain, you require to be in some functional state with some apparatus, so our brain and the function is defined by our inputs, our sense data we receive externally based upon our outputs, something is gonna have the functional state of being in pain only if for every input they get, they always react with some output.
Behaviourism is similar to functionalism but what separates the two is that it is more than what is observable, it takes into account the pure mental states the behaviourist cannot. The functionalist takes into account the methods of which we get these inputs and outputs using pure mental processes as the behaviourist cannot.
An attempt at refuting functionalism is Searle's Chinese Room Problem. If a person was given a book full of `if x, then y, if a, then b` statements and was given x, they would output y. The example specifically included chinese letters being inputting and outputting answers based on those letters, this would be the human equivalent of a turing machine. Does this person know chinese? The question is ambiguous to one, the time at which the person is asked as it doesn't take into account the process of learning these translations as at one point they don't but in the future after continual interactions with the translations, i might be yes. And two, the translations given is not an adequate representation of the language we engage in as language isn't merely a translation. Another objection is that the analogy of the translations to language is impossible as language is infinite making this book also infinite and empirically impossible, not intuitively impossible. Language isn't feasible in the way this example attempts to make it out to be, natural language is necessarily built on human intuition and cant be constructed in such a thing as a turing machine as the example tries to draw to because of how language works. Recursion in language is simply a web of definitions by which everything is in reference to another definition or itself, a tautology, circular but not fallacious as it is not a justification. If you start correcting some of the points in The Chinese Room Problem like, the analogy of the translation and language, the infinite book, you start to get an example that demonstrates the proof of functionalism.

## What is Meaning
[[link]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7MNbSovFMg)
Theories of meaning being analogous to theories of truth
- What is the meaning of `plato`? We look to its reference to the world.
The morning star example
- What is it? Well it's a star in the sky, it's bright and appears in a certain location. To answer what it is, I used the reference I have to the external world. But I come across an unknown culture and I ask one of the members of this culture `What's your favourite star?` they respond `the evening star` its description is the same as the reference to the morning star but they name it differently, so how can there be two meanings from two agents from one reference?
- The meaning of a sentence is determined by the meaning of the words partaking in that sentence. `The morning star is bright` can be broken down into `The morning star` being the first segment, namely M1, and `is bright` being the second segment, namely M2. the combination of M1 and M2 makes the sentence M3. when trying to evaluate `The evening star is bright` follows these same rules, `The evening star`, namely M4, and `is bright` , namely M5, making `The evening star is bright` M6. M2 and M5 have the same reference as they are the same statement and M1 and M4 are the same as the reference is the same to the same star in the sky making M3 and M6 the same. But intuitively they're not the same right? This is because of this analysis being devoid of sense.
- Frege argues this extra component is Sense. Sense is how someone comes to know the reference of the word. To answer the posed question earlier, the morning star and the evening star have a different sense to them. The reference can be the same but an individual agent can have a different sense of that reference. Frege doesn't argue this sense is neither mental or physical, not psychological, that they do exist in a third realm. Frege argues when two people share the same sense of the same word, they have the same thought of that word because they access this same thought from this third realm.
Notions of sense
- The mode of presentation
- The mode of determination
- The cognitive content of a word
Frege Principles
- Principle of Compositionality
    - The meaning of a sentence is determined by the meaning of its parts. The reference of a sentence is its truth value.
- Context Principle
    - The meaning of an expression depends on its context
Vocabulary/Language
- Singular Terms/Names
- Predicates/Functions
- `The evening star is bright` is broken down to the singular term `the evening star` referencing the star in the external world and the function `x is bright` referring to its extension of everything that is bright. If the reference of a sentence is its truth value, then truth has a reference. Frege holds to an identity theory of truth and this reference exists in the third realm.

# Philosophy of Science
## Scientific Anti-Realism
**Instrumentalism**
## Types of Naturalism
Philosophical Naturalism
- A central thought on this is that all spatio temporal entities must be identical to or metaphysically constituted by physical entities. Many ontological naturalists thus adopt a physicalist attitude to mental, biological, social and other such “special” subject matters. They hold that there is nothing more to the mental, biological and social realms than arrangements of physical entities.
- This results in what they call `empirical` statements which are inductive in nature. This is applied globally making this position basically epistemic nihilism because this theory does not accept the analytic-synthetic distinction or the a priori-a posteriori distinction which are vital to fundamental objectivity to avoid complete relativism. Hulme would say the `laws of nature` are not things in the world, they are psychological tools in which we live our daily lives. Causality isn't a thing to be observed, it's an observation in which we inductively tie together events that i just call causality.

> Argument
Methodological Naturalism
- Methodological Naturalism is the specific claim that philosophy and science are both concerned to establish synthetic knowledge about the natural world, and moreover to achieve this by a posteriori investigation. From the methodological naturalist perspective, then, philosophical views are synthetic claims that answer to the overall tribunal of a posteriori observational evidence. The obvious objection to this view, however, is that it does not accord with philosophical practice. In particular, it seems in tension with the central role that intuitions play in philosophy. The typical way to assess philosophical views is arguably to test them against intuitive judgements about possible cases, not against a posteriori observational data. So, for example, the description theory of names is challenged by our intuitions about Kripke’s imagined counterexamples, the tripartite theory of knowledge by our intuitive reactions to Gettier cases, and so on. At first pass, this certainly suggests that philosophy is centrally concerned with the analysis of everyday concepts, not the construction of synthetic theories: it is using intuitions about possible cases to uncover the structure implicit in our concepts. The reliance on intuitions thus argues that, far from delivering synthetic a posteriori knowledge, philosophy uses a priori methods to deliver analytic conclusions.

## Mathematical Realism
Mathematical realism holds that mathematical entities exist independently of the human mind. Thus humans do not invent mathematics, but rather discover it, and any other intelligent beings in the universe would presumably do the same. In this point of view, there is really one sort of mathematics that can be discovered; triangles, for example, are real entities, not the creations of the human mind.
### Platonism
Mathematical anti-realism generally holds that mathematical statements have truth-values, but that they do not do so by corresponding to a special realm of immaterial or non-empirical entities. Major forms of mathematical anti-realism include formalism and fictionalism.
### Formalism
### Fictionalism
## Infinity
### Possible Infinities
### Actual Infinities
## Set Theory
`Set theory is the foundation of mathematics. All mathematical concepts are defined in terms of the primitive notions of set and membership. In axiomatic set theory we formulate a few simple axioms about these primitive notions in an attempt to capture the basic "obviously true" set-theoretic principles. From such axioms, all known mathematics may be derived.` [[link]](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/bafykbzacebyuhltlejphpgrmwn6jbwvqdocfleyea5nzpz4aqkb2t73mgshqo?filename=%28Studies%20in%20Logic%20and%20the%20Foundations%20of%20Mathematics%20102%29%20Kenneth%20Kunen%20-%20Set%20Theory.%20An%20Introduction%20to%20Independence%20Proofs-North%20Holland%20%281980%29.pdf)
### Naive Set Theory
Naive set theory, unlike axiomatic set theories, which are defined using formal logic, is defined informally, in natural language. It describes the aspects of mathematical sets familiar in discrete mathematics and suffixes for the everyday use of set theory concepts in contemporary mathematics.
### Russell's Paradox
The paradox arises within naïve set theory by considering the set of all sets that are not members of themselves. Such a set appears to be a member of itself if and only if it is not a member of itself. Hence the paradox.
Some sets, such as the set of all teacups, are not members of themselves. Other sets, such as the set of all non-teacups, are members of themselves. Call the set of all sets that are not members of themselves “R.” If R is a member of itself, then by definition it must not be a member of itself. Similarly, if R is not a member of itself, then by definition it must be a member of itself.
### Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory
Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory with the Axiom of Choice included, is the standard form of axiomatic set theory and as such is the most common foundation of modern mathematics.
