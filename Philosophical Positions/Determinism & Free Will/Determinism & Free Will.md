Thoughts have an end in respect to both the conceptual process, meaning how a thought can end while another can arise like a new topic, and the systematic process of thinking, meaning thinking can end. A person who has thoughts can cease to have thoughts, namely death.
This isn't the case for actions. Whenever we observe some action, we always have a secondary action, there never seems to be a causal closure in the observed events, only another action.
Thoughts don't carry causal reactions to each other but can have relation to other events. Even though this is the case, this doesn't make thought causal.
Actions described as free under this model would be defined as non-causal and therefore irrational.
