## Cartesian Dualism

Mental Plane - my sensations of emotions, namely `Cartesian Egos` which are private
Physical Plane - my interactions with physical objects
Argument against, The Dread interaction problem: how does something from the mental realm interact with the physical realm? Descartes posited it was the pineal gland, an ad-hoc explanation. Leibnitz posited there are no such interactions, but that there was a pre-established harmony set in stone from the birth of creation. This would be a clockmaker argument similar to the clockmaker argument for god, again an ad-hoc explanation. Leibnitz and Descartes were theists btw, dualism usually posits God.
Or if Cartesian Egos are naturalistic states, then they exist in the physical plane making this reduce to some form of materialism/physicalism making this Cartesian Egos publicly investigatable. This is what happened in the history of philosophy of mind. The dualist majority collapsed into some form of monism, some behaviourists
The incredulous stare argument: for every mental event i have, there seems to be a correlation to a brain state i have
