## Moral Objectivism Vs Subjectivism
### Objectivism
Moral Facts are Objective
### Subjectivism
Moral Facts are Subjective
Rems Argument Against Moral Subjectivism:
- P1: Moral disagreements are disagreements about preferences
- P2: In cases of disagreements over preferences, it's best to step back and find an impartial mediator (because neither preference can be pragmatically chosen)
- P3: In cases of moral disagreement it *isn't* the case that one should always seek an impartial mediator (e.g. disagreement over genocide)
- P4: Moral disagreement can't be disagreement over preferences
- C1: Moral subjectivism is wrong
This is a rough version of Enoch's first defense of Robust Realism. It's very compelling, but obviously the argument must be adjusted to each version of moral subjectivism (for the one described here likely doesn't exist).
Argument Against Moral Subjectivism:
- P1: According to the Moral Subjectivist theory, all Moral statements are subjective.
- P2: if all morality is subjective, then there are no moral facts.
- P3: if there are no moral facts, then there are no epistemic facts.
- P4: But there are epistemic facts.
- C1: Therefore, Moral Subjectivism is false.
