## Moral Naturalism Vs Non-Naturalism
### Naturalist
investigatable like other observable properties
'bad things are bad by definition`
`pain is bad` is a tautology
Argues said tautologies are analytic statements
Is analysed like a natural science
### Non-naturalist
Rejects Naturalism,
Moore argues they commit the Naturalistic Fallacy
Argues that if naturalist statements were analytic statements, then why do you have to define it that way, meaning it seems to be a synthetic distinction, not a analytic one
Kant writes in the Critique of Pure Reason,

> ‘If the receptivity of our mind, its power of receiving representations in so far as it is in any wise affected, is to be entitled sensibility, then the mind's power of producing representations from itself, the spontaneity of knowledge, should be called the understanding. Our nature is so constituted that our intuition can never be other than sensible; that is, it contains only the mode in which we are affected by objects. The faculty, on the other hand, which enables us to think the object of sensible intuition is the understanding. To neither of these powers may a preference be given over the other. Without sensibility no object would be given to us, without understanding no object would be thought. Thoughts without content are empty, intuitions without concepts are blind. It is, therefore, just as necessary to make our concepts sensible, that is, to add the object to them in intuition, as to make our intuitions intelligible, that is, to bring them under concepts. These two powers or capacities cannot exchange their functions. The understanding can intuit nothing, the senses can think nothing. Only through their union can knowledge arise. But that is no reason for confounding the contribution of either with that of the other; rather is it a strong reason for carefully separating and distinguishing the one from the other. We therefore distinguish the science of the rules of sensibility in general, that is, aesthetic, from the science of the rules of the understanding in general, that is, logic.’
Kant writes about how just sense data makes no complete concept of knowledge without understanding (consciousness). Analytic statements are not complete by just sense data alone making the naturalist theory false.
Argument against Moral Naturalism
- P1: According to the Moral Naturalist theory, Moral Naturalism is true because of an analytical observation of morality in the external world.
- P2: if you can have a analytical observation, then it would be a posteriori analytic truth,
- P3: a posteriori analytic truth are self contradictory
- C1: Therefore, Moral Naturalism is false
