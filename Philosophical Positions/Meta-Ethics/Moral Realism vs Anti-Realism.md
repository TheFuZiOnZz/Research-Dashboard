## Moral Realism vs Anti-Realism
Categorical normative reasons are normative reasons for agents to do things or have certain attitudes irrespective of their desires, aims, wants and feelings, and the roles in which they happen to find themselves. These reasons for agents to do things are ontologically and existentially independent of these agents’ desires, aims, wants, feelings and roles.
A Categorical Reason can be defined as a norm. You have epistemic norms and moral norms.
- Examples of epistemic norms
    - Correspondence Theory of Truth
    - Coherentist Theory of Knowledge
    - X theory of belief
- Examples of Moral Norms
    - Kant's categorical imperative
    - Utilitarian maximization principle
Hypothetical normative reasons are reasons for agents to do things or have certain attitudes that are not independent of these agents’ desires, aims or roles. For instance, if, but only if, you like blueberry muffins, there is a reason for you to buy some. From the moral realism position, they accept that moral statements are true by the theory of truth they hold to. Making a true moral statement makes that statement a moral fact. To deny moral realism is to deny moral fact which is to deny their own theory of truth.
### Moral Non-Cognitivism
Moral Non-Cognitivism states that moral statements are not true or false. By extension, a Non-Cognitivist says all moral statements are meaningless because they are not a fact of the world. Examples of Non-Cognitivist points are:
- If moral judgments are considered to be mental states, then noncognitivism is the denial that moral judgments are beliefs.
- If moral judgments are considered to be sentence types, then noncognitivism is the denial that moral judgments have an underlying grammar that expresses a proposition.
- If moral judgments are considered to be speech acts, then noncognitivism is the denial that moral judgments are assertions.
If you accept a theory of truth, the burden for the Non-Cognitivist is to prove how you can hold a theory of truth and not apply said theory to moral claims.
Argument for Moral realism in regards to against Moral Non-Cognitivism:
- P1: According to the Non-Cognitivist theory, there are no categorical normative reasons.
- P2: If there are no categorical normative reasons, then there are no epistemic reasons for belief.
- P3: But there are epistemic reasons for belief.
- P4: So there are categorical normative reasons.
- C1: So the Non-Cognitivism theory is false.
### Moral Error Theory
Moral Error Theory states that all moral statements are false. The moral error theorist doesn't believe in such things as moral obligation, moral value, moral desert, moral virtue, and moral permission.
Argument for Moral realism in regards to against Moral Error Theory:
- P1: According to Error Theory, all categorical normative reasons are false.
- P2: If all categorical normative reasons are false, then all epistemic reasons for belief are false.
- P3: If all epistemic reasons for belief are false, then there are no epistemic reasons for belief.
- P4: But there are epistemic reasons for belief.
- P5: So it's false that all categorical normative reasons are false.
- P6: So there are true categorical normative reasons.
- C1: So Error Theory is false.
    
    ### The Argument from Relativity
    
    The argument states that because of moral disagreement between people means that no moral fact can exist.
    
    Argument for Moral realism in regards to against The Argument from Relativity:
    
    - P1: According to The Argument from Relativity, there are no categorical normative reasons because there is moral disagreement.
    - P2: If there is disagreement with this argument, then the argument says you should accept the conclusion of not believing the argument.
    - P3: So either the argument refutes itself or the argument is false.
    - C1: So The Argument from Relativity is false.
    
    ### The Argument from Queerness
    
    This argument has two strands, an epistemic argument and a metaphysical argument.
    
    The epistemic argument states that our conception of a moral property is essentially one of a very unusual kind of property, such that countenancing its instantiation requires us to posit in the world “qualities or relations of a very strange sort, utterly different from anything else in the universe” this makes the case that morality cant be found in the real world which isn't a claim a non-naturalist realist would disagree with.
    
    The metaphysical argument states that in order to track such weird properties we would need “some special faculty of moral perception or intuition, utterly different from our ordinary ways of knowing everything else”. These conversations on morality are not mind-independent arguments, these are arguments of if it meets the bar of objectivity.
    
    The problem for the error theorist is a misconception of how moral arguments work, you can have mind-dependent arguments using mind-independant normative principles and have a coherent and deductive system.
    
    If you accept a theory of truth, the burden for the Error Theorist is to prove how you can hold a normative ethical system and make moral prescriptions and then be consistent and you can't build a coherent system on false beliefs.
    
    Mackie in context to Kant's categorical Imperative writes:
    
    > `So far as ethics is concerned, my thesis that there are no objective values is specifically the denial that any such categorically imperative element is objectively valid. The objective values which I am denying would be action-directing absolutely, not contingently (in the way indicated) upon the agent's desires and inclinations`
    
    The statement proposed implies that the categorical imperative is objectively valid by appealing to another Normative system of some type of emotivism. Mackie continues to write about supposing an example of some evaluative conclusion:
    
    > `let us suppose that we could make explicit the reasoning that supports some evaluative conclusion, where this conclusion has some action-guiding force that is not contingent upon desires or purposes or chosen ends.Then what I am saying is that somewhere in the input to this argument - perhaps in one or more of the premisses, perhaps in some part of the form of the argument - there will be something which cannot be objectively validated - some premiss which is not capable of being simply true, or some form of argument which is not valid as a matter of general logic, whose authority or cogency is not objective, but is constituted by our choosing or deciding to think in a certain way.`
    
    The realist reply to this conclusion Mackie has here …..
    
### Quasi Realism
A Quasi Realist would argue that moral truths are based in moral agreement. This falls privy to the same objections as the Error Theorists argument from relativity. A ‘fact’ based on inter-subjective agreements is entirely subjective but again this is a question of Objectivism vs Subjectivism, this presupposes realism entirely, to assert that moral facts are either objective stipulations or subjective intuitions require the belief in morality being real.
