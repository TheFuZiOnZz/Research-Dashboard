Something is true if it corresponds to something that is real. This is a scientific type method of truth. Problems with this theory include a problem with perspective in regards to how something is true without my correspondence of that event or thought.
- x is true if x corresponds to some fact; x is false if x does not correspond to any fact.
Definitions of the theory are too narrow. Although they apply to truths from some domains of discourse, e.g., the domain of science, they fail for others, e.g. the domain of morality: there are no moral facts. The objection recognizes moral truths, but rejects the idea that reality contains moral facts for moral truths to correspond to.
Argument against the correspondence theory:
- P1: if the correspondence theory of truth is correct, then there are no moral truths
- P2: if there are no moral facts, then there are no epistemic facts.
- P3: But there are epistemic facts.
- C1: Therefore, correspondence theory of truth is incorrect.
