## Necessary Conditions
A Necessary Condition is defined by its logical necessity to make core philosophical claims. Without these conditions, there would be no basis or context to philosophical claims. Such a necessary condition might be a logically necessary condition, but often in Kantâ€™s transcendental arguments the condition is necessary in the sense that it is the only possible explanation for the premise. Reductio ad Absurdum is defined by how you can conclude an absurd statement to be false. This is identical to how Kant transcendental arguments work.
We can create a criterion in which we can find out if aspects of our philosophy are necessary or not, if the opposite is logically impossible or contradictory. For example, let's posit 3 ideas and find out if they are necessary or not, Burgers, God and Knowledge.
- Are `Burgers` Necessary? Well as a Ontological identity of a type of food, the contrapositive would be no burgers, the only thing that can't be analysed now would be burgers, there is no logical collapse following from a contradiction to remove that idea so no, burgers are not necessary.
- Is `Knowledge` Necessary? Well as a Epistemic category, the contrapositive would be no knowledge. Well without the idea of Knowledge, what would philosophy be without knowing it, nothing could be analysed, there is a collapse of the philosophical system to remove that idea so yes, Knowledge is necessary.
