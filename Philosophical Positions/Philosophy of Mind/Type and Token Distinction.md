`Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose.`
In one sense of ‘word’ we may count three different words; in another sense we may count ten different words. C. S. Peirce called words in the first sense “types” and words in the second sense “tokens”.

> Type: physical corresponds to a mental, two perceptions of the same event are the result of the same mind state in two different brains/people.
> 
> Subject to the Extraterrestrials/multi realizability Objection:
> 
> If there were a lifeform made of silicon bonds and humans are made of carbon bonds and those neurons which trigger those brain states are from those carbon bonds, do these silicon bond lifeforms have mental states? If yes or no, then what makes human minds so special?
> 
> Token: rather than a perception, its a concrete particular of spatio temporal existence
