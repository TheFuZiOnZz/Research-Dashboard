## What is Meaning

Theories of meaning being analogous to theories of truth
- What is the meaning of `plato`? We look to its reference to the world.
The morning star example
- What is it? Well it's a star in the sky, it's bright and appears in a certain location. To answer what it is, I used the reference I have to the external world. But I come across an unknown culture and I ask one of the members of this culture `What's your favourite star?` they respond `the evening star` its description is the same as the reference to the morning star but they name it differently, so how can there be two meanings from two agents from one reference?
- The meaning of a sentence is determined by the meaning of the words partaking in that sentence. `The morning star is bright` can be broken down into `The morning star` being the first segment, namely M1, and `is bright` being the second segment, namely M2. the combination of M1 and M2 makes the sentence M3. when trying to evaluate `The evening star is bright` follows these same rules, `The evening star`, namely M4, and `is bright` , namely M5, making `The evening star is bright` M6. M2 and M5 have the same reference as they are the same statement and M1 and M4 are the same as the reference is the same to the same star in the sky making M3 and M6 the same. But intuitively they're not the same right? This is because of this analysis being devoid of sense.
- Frege argues this extra component is Sense. Sense is how someone comes to know the reference of the word. To answer the posed question earlier, the morning star and the evening star have a different sense to them. The reference can be the same but an individual agent can have a different sense of that reference. Frege doesn't argue this sense is neither mental or physical, not psychological, that they do exist in a third realm. Frege argues when two people share the same sense of the same word, they have the same thought of that word because they access this same thought from this third realm.
Notions of sense
- The mode of presentation
- The mode of determination
- The cognitive content of a word
Frege Principles
- Principle of Compositionality
    - The meaning of a sentence is determined by the meaning of its parts. The reference of a sentence is its truth value.
- Context Principle
    - The meaning of an expression depends on its context
Vocabulary/Language
- Singular Terms/Names
- Predicates/Functions
- `The evening star is bright` is broken down to the singular term `the evening star` referencing the star in the external world and the function `x is bright` referring to its extension of everything that is bright. If the reference of a sentence is its truth value, then truth has a reference. Frege holds to an identity theory of truth and this reference exists in the third realm.
