Assuming that resupply may be difficult during a pandemic, hospitals should stockpile enough masks for 3 weeks. \--Shortages of N95 masks should be anticipated, \--If no other masks are available, surgical masks, which will provide droplet protection, should be used.3 Powered air purifying respirators (PAPRs) should be available for use in high risk aerosol-generating procedures. |

However, absence of evidence of effectiveness should not be equated to evidence of ineffectiveness, especially when facing a novel situation with limited alternative options. It has long been recommended that for respiratory infections like influenza, affected patients should wear masks to limit droplet spread. If everyone puts on a mask in public places, it would help to remove stigmatisation that has hitherto discouraged masking of symptomatic patients in many places. Furthermore, transmission from asymptomatic infected individuals has been documented for COVID-19, and viral load is particularly high at early disease stage. Masking, as a public health intervention, would probably intercept the transmission link and prevent these apparently healthy infectious sources.” |

| Balazy / 2006 | [Do N95 Respirators Provide 95% Protection Level Against Airborne Viruses, and How Adequate Are Surgical Masks?](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16490606/)  |  | The N95 filtering face piece respirators may not provide the expected protection level against small virions. Some surgical masks may let a significant fraction of airborne viruses penetrate through their filters, providing very low protection against aerosolized infectious agents in the size range of 10 to 80 nm. It should be noted that the surgical masks are primarily designed to protect the environment from the wearer, whereas the respirators are supposed to protect the wearer from the environment. |

This must be measured for each individual and their selected respirator. Selecting the right respirator for a particular workplace exposure depends largely on selecting the right level of protection. |
| Qian / 1998 | [Performance of N95 Respirators: Filtration Efficiency for Airborne Microbial and Inert Particles](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9487666/) |  | N95 respirators were found to have higher filtration efficiencies than DM (dust/mist) and DFM (dust/fume/mist) respirators and noncertified surgical masks.  Thus, N95 respirators provide excellent protection against airborne particles when there is a good face seal. |

Because most of the penetrated particles entered through the faceseal, the priority in respirator/mask development should be shifted from improving the efficiency of the filter medium to establishing a better fit that would eliminate or minimize faceseal leakage. |

Universal adoption will likely slow the spread of the COVID-19 virus by reducing transmission from asymptomatic individuals. We provide strongly suggestive evidence from cross-country data that facemask use slows the growth rate of cases and deaths. This complements extant scientific data on mask usage. Our analysis suggests each cloth facemask generates thousands of dollars in value from reduced mortality risk. Each medical mask, when used by a healthcare worker, may generate millions of dollars in value, and policies to encourage greater production prioritized for health workers are urgently needed.” About COVID-19: “The average daily growth rate of confirmed positives is 18% in countries with no pre-existing mask norms and 10% in countries with such norms.”“we find that the growth rate of deaths is 21% in countries with no mask norms and 11% in countries with such norms." |

It is likely that many countries in the lowest-mortality group, which have advocated mask-wearing by the public, have been able to prevent well over 99% of their population from becoming infected. On April 4, 2020, the data related to Western countries, such as the Czech Republic, which recently mandated mask usage are consistent with a leveling-off of mortality. The authors recommended that all members of the public to wear a mask (or available face covering) whenever near other members of the public, or near surfaces touched by other members of the public (such as groceries, keyboards, tables, or doorknobs).   |
