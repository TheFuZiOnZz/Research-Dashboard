## Western Imperialism of Trade
- A 2015 paper found that:
    - `Two main findings emerge from this analysis. First, at its peak in 1996, trade from territories designated under the Basel Convention as Annex VII [composed of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the European Community (EC) and Lichtenstein] to non-Annex VII territories (all other signatories) accounted for just over 35% of total trade. By 2012 trade from Annex VII to non-Annex VII territories accounted for less than 1% of total trade. Second, between 1996 and 2012 the two groups of territories evolved different regional trade orientations: Annex VII territories are predominantly trading intra-regionally, with 73–82% of total trade moving between Annex VII territories.` - [The changing geography of global trade in electronic discards: time to rethink the e‐waste problem, Lepawsky, 2015](https://sci-hub.ee/10.1111/geoj.12077)
- A 2018 paper found that:
    - `The share of US expenditure on imports is smaller than in most other countries`
    - `Although magnitudes vary greatly depending on how one infers the shape of the US demand for foreign factor services, the estimates of gains from trade for the US economy that we review range from 2 to 8 percent of GDP. Although such gains are nothing to spit at, they may appear surprisingly small to some. It may be the case that if the United States were to approach autarky, the US demand for foreign factor services would become much less elastic, revealing the importance of some critical foreign inputs and, in turn, much larger gains from trade.` - [The US Gains From Trade: Valuation Using the Demand for Foreign Factor Services, Costinot and Rodríguez-Clare, 2018](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.32.2.3)
