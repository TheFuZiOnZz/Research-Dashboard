## Unemployment benefits
### US Unemployment Insurance
- A 2017 paper found that `This paper has taken advantage of a discontinuity in the Austrian UI system and identified a positive UI effect on re-employment wages. We argue that the magnitude of this UI wage effect is economically meaningful from both an individual and a social perspective. The magnitude of the effect is consistent with rational behavior of an agent who extends her unemployment by being more selective in her job search, knowing that this can help secure a lasting wage gain upon reemployment. Moreover, from a social perspective, the UI wage effect implies a considerable positive fiscal externality.` - [link](https://sci-hub.ee/10.1257/aer.20150528)
- A 2020 paper found that `We use LEHD data and find that match quality explains 35% of the increased wages due to more generous UI, while employer quality can explain almost 50% of the wage increase from UI. By contrast, we find that sorting is not much affected by more generous UI benefits. Consistent with both improved matches and employer quality, we find that extended UI benefit duration increases the likelihood of remaining in the job one year later, thus increasing job stability. In total, the increase in wages and the increase in job stability would imply an increase in earnings of $4,593 due to the increased generosity in UI benefit duration.` - [link](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w27574/w27574.pdf)

### European Union
- A 2011 paper found that `While the OLS analysis revealed the presence of a moderate correlation between social welfare spending and immigration from non-EU origins, the IV and GMM estimates indicate that the causal effect is smaller and statistically insignificant, thereby rejecting the welfare magnet hypothesis. All estimates for EU immigrants are essentially zero, which suggests that immigration within the EU does not respond to unemployment benefit incentives.` - [link](https://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&context=lew2012)
