- A 2015 paper concluded that:
    - `SNAP effectively alleviates food insecurity in terms of caloric, macronutrient, and micronutrient intake. Still, SNAP participants are struggling more than income-eligible and higher-income nonparticipants to meet key dietary guidelines. Future policies should ensure that this vital food assistance program addresses diet quality while reducing food insecurity.` - [Dietary Quality of Americans by Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Participation Status: A Systematic Review, Andreyeva et al., 2015](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1016/j.amepre.2015.04.035)
- A 2015 report found that:
    - `We find that SNAP redemptions (the value of SNAP benefits redeemed by SNAP-authorized stores) had a positive average impact on county-level employment throughout the 2001 to 2014 period, with an increase of between 0.4 and 0.5 job per $10,000 of additional SNAP redemptions across all counties over the entire period.` `As expected, the impact of SNAP redemptions on employment was greater during the recession period (2008 to 2010) than either the pre-recession period (2001 to 2007) or the postrecession period (2011 to 2014) in both nonmetro and metro counties. In the recession period, SNAP redemptions contributed to about 1.0 job per $10,000 of additional SNAP redemptions in nonmetro counties and about 0.4 job per $10,000 of additional SNAP redemptions in metro counties.` - [The Impacts of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Redemptions on County-Level Employment, United States Department of Agriculture and Pender, 2019](https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/93169/err-263.pdf?v=1509.3)
- A 2017 study found that:
    - `The SEBTC SNAP demonstration provided SNAP-like benefits in the summer to households <185% of the federal poverty limit with children receiving the school food programs during the school year. In 2012, the $60 monthly per child benefit amounted to approximately $90 per month per household, analogous to a 25% increase in SNAP` - [Improving Nutrition by Increasing Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Benefits, Collins and Klerman, 2017](https://www.ajpmonline.org/action/showPdf?pii=S0749-3797%2816%2930389-0)
- A 2016 paper concluded that:
    - `Majority of vendors from each market did believe that SNAP increased sales, but the percentage of increased sales is generally not higher than 5 percent. A potentially more crucial impact of the program is an increase in customer base, and fewer vendors in each market saw their customer base increase due to SNAP acceptance. Still, a majority of vendors did feel that the customer base has increased, that number could rise if the amount of promotional materials increased, drawing in new market customers.` - [Analysis of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Programs in Farmers' Markets, Thomas, 2016](https://scholarworks.uark.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1002&context=scwkuht)
- A 2014 report found that:
    - `The findings of this health impact assessment suggest that many of the SNAP policy changes considered to modify how eligibility or benefit levels are determined would likely place the health of low-income Americans at greater risk.` - [Health Impact Assessment of Proposed Changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Wernham, 2014](https://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/assets/2014/11/hiahealthimpactsnapwhitepaper.pdf)
