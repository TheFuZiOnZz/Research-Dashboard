- The Green new Deal is a proposed package of United States legislation that aims to address climate change and economic inequality.
- Trump in 2019 speaking to employees of Sempra Energy, he said `That’s a hoax...Under that deal, everybody in this room gets fired.` [link](https://boingboing.net/2019/05/14/trump-says-green-new-deal-is.html) Trump has tweeted ` I think it is very important for the Democrats to press forward with their Green New Deal. It would be great for the so-called "Carbon Footprint" to permanently eliminate all Planes, Cars, Cows, Oil, Gas & the Military – even if no other country would do the same. Brilliant!` [link](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1094375749279248385)
- The Green New Deal is no hoax. Instead, the resolution is one of the few calls to climate action that rises to the scale of the crisis.

Every economist I talked to agreed: The Green New Deal would be a job creator. Most said it's impossible to know exactly how many jobs it will add to the economy, but studies generally show that government investments in green technology boost employment possibilities.` [link](https://psmag.com/economics/will-the-green-new-deal-work-heres-what-the-research-says)
- The University of Massachusetts­–Amherst calculated what would be needed to cut the U.S.'s carbon emissions by 40 percent in 20 years. The study found that the American government and private companies would have to invest a collective $200 billion a year, the government should collect about $200 billion a year in carbon taxes, about 1.5 million jobs would be destroyed, and 4.2 million new jobs would be created.

- Carolyn Heinrich, a public policy professor at Vanderbilt University. Often, with worker retraining, she says, "what we're not able to do is get to them where they were before." People might have to start over in a new industry, at a lower level than they're used to. Or, if a disappeared industry affects their entire region, they may have to move (but then, how to sell a house in a region where jobs have been gutted?). "So it looks like a negative impact, right?" Heinrich says. "Compared to people who just go out and start working."
