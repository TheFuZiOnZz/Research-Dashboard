- There are two scenarios in which are most successful and applicable to the majority of countries, an indexed minimum wage not requiring (but not discouraging) strong unions, or no minimum wage policies with strong unions and sectoral bargaining, namely the Nordic model.
- Seattle is a well studied case for indexed minimum wage which is attached to the areas Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers or CPI-W, [link](https://lni.wa.gov/workers-rights/wages/minimum-wage/history-of-washington-states-minimum-wage) and that the U.S. is known for its low membership of Unions. [link](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/union2.nr0.htm)
- Whilst it has all the positive effects of increasing the minimum wage does, the problem is whilst adaptive to the general labor market and its median wages, it doesn't address individual sectoral downsides minimum wage might impact negatively, so whilst the average wage across an area would rise, because certain sectors cant uphold the wage for the same hours, they either cut the amount of hours or close the business.
    - `Research on the effects of minimum wage laws on low-wage workers suggests that the policy increases wages but can also lead to small reductions in hours and employment as employers adjust to higher costs` - [Responding to an Increased Minimum Wage: A Mixed Methods Study of Child Care Businesses during the Implementation of Seattle's Minimum Wage Ordinance, Otten et al., 2018](https://ejournals.bib.uni-wuppertal.de/index.php/sws/article/view/538/1063)
    - `we conclude that the second wage increase to $13 reduced hours worked in low-wage jobs by 6-7 percent, while hourly wages in such jobs increased by 3 percent.` - [Minimum Wage Increases, Wages, and Low-Wage Employment: Evidence from Seattle, Jardim et al., 2017](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w23532/w23532.pdf)
- This problem is analogous to that in the U.S, minimum wage as a federal law on the state level, that because of the varied different standards of living, a set level across the entire country has big varied economic impact, it's debatable on whether that would be net positive or negative but as the effect in general would be so big, it's safe to assume both the positive and negatives would also be big.
- The Nordic model is an example of no legally set minimum wage but strong unions with sectoral bargaining meaning that even with no minimum wage laws, the minimum wage tends to hover near 60% to 70% of the average wage in Sweden. and strong labor force protections.

    - `Unions raise wages for all types of workers. When unionized workers are compared with similar nonunionized counterparts, analysis shows union wages are about 12 percent higher.` `Union employers, compared with similar nonunion employers: Contribute 56 percent more toward workers’ retirement, Pay 77 percent more toward workers’ health care, Provide 11 percent more toward paid vacation and holidays.` - [American Workers Need Unions, Walter and Madland, 2019](https://www.americanprogressaction.org/issues/economy/reports/2019/04/02/173622/american-workers-need-unions/)
- Whilst it has all the positive effects of increasing the minimum wage does, the problem is that this results in next to no leverage for the workers in companies with no union organisation and for a country with no legal minimum wage, there's no insurance to a liveable or even received wage.
## $15 Minimum Wage
- Trump has given a number of contradictory statements on whether he would support increasing the federal minimum wage. In 2015, Trump said he wanted to `keep the minimum wage pretty much where it is right now` in an interview with MSNBC, and two months later told Fox News that a New York proposal to raise its lowest wage to $15 an hour was `too high.` But in November and December of that year, Trump said wages were `too low` and told Fox News he supported a $15.

- On June 19, 2019, President Trump bragged at his re-election kickoff rally in Orlando that, thanks to his leadership, the wages of American workers `are rising at the fastest rate in many decades.` [link](https://www.counterpunch.org/2019/08/29/trump-has-blocked-wage-gains-for-american-workers/)
- A majority of workers are in debt and struggling to get by; many work multiple jobs. 78% of U.S. workers live paycheck to paycheck to make ends meet. Nearly 10% of workers making $100,000+ live paycheck to paycheck. More than 25% of workers do not set aside any savings each month. Nearly 75% of workers say they are in debt today. More than 50% think they will always be. More than 50% of minimum wage workers say they have to work more than one job to make ends meet. 70% of minimum wage workers are in debt.

- Pew Research found that Americans’ paychecks are bigger than 40 years ago, but their purchasing power has hardly budged. `Despite the strong labor market, wage growth has lagged economists’ expectations. In fact, despite some ups and downs over the past several decades, today’s real average wage (that is, the wage after accounting for inflation) has about the same purchasing power it did 40 years ago. And what wage gains there have been have mostly flowed to the highest-paid tier of workers.` [link](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/08/07/for-most-us-workers-real-wages-have-barely-budged-for-decades/)
- The Economic Policy Institute reported in December 2019 that: `Working people saw no discernible wage increase due to the Tax Act. The tight labor market and higher state-level minimum wages can explain the wage growth in 2018.` In reference to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.

- Biden Is in support of `Increase the federal minimum wage to $15. As Vice President, Biden helped get state and local laws increasing the minimum wage across the finish line – including in New York State – and has supported eliminating the tipped minimum wage. He firmly believes all Americans are owed a raise, and it’s well past time we increase the federal minimum wage to $15 across the country.` [link](https://joebiden.com/empowerworkers/)
- Biden Is in support of `Ensure federal dollars do not flow to employers who engage in union-busting activities, participate in wage theft, or violate labor law. Biden will institute a multi-year federal debarment for all employers who illegally oppose unions, building on debarment efforts pursued in the Obama-Biden Administration. Biden will also restore and build on the Obama-Biden Administration’s Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces executive order, which Trump revoked, requiring employers’ compliance with labor and employment laws be taken into account in determining whether they are sufficiently responsible to be entrusted with federal contracts.` [link](https://joebiden.com/empowerworkers/)
- Biden Is in support to `Aggressively pursue employers who violate labor laws, participate in wage theft, or cheat on their taxes by intentionally misclassifying employees as independent contractors. As president, Biden will put a stop to employers intentionally misclassifying their employees as independent contractors. He will enact legislation that makes worker misclassification a substantive violation of law under all federal labor, employment, and tax laws with additional penalties beyond those imposed for other violations.` [link](https://joebiden.com/empowerworkers/)
