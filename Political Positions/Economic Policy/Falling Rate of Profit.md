- A 1976 paper found that:
    - `The above very sketchy review of the literature on Marx's law of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall has shown us that-at present-no satisfactory formulation of this law exists.` - [Marx and the Falling Rate of Profit, Christiansen, 1976](https://sci-hub.st/https://www.jstor.org/stable/1817193?seq=1)
- A 2007 journal found that:
    - `A more realistic estimate of annual working hours is provided by Huberman (2002), who takes into account differences in weekly working hours, paid leave and public holidays. As Figure 3.1 shows, working hours in industrialized countries were reduced dramatically in the last century. In the Netherlands, for example, workers worked 3,285 hours per year in 1870 but only 1,347 hours in 2000. Interestingly, this reduction of working hours coincided with economic progress: the period of severe economic turbulence between 1929 and 1950 was accompanied by fluctuations in working hours, sometimes involving an upward trend. Other periods such as post-World War I and post-World War II are largely characterized by progressive reductions in working hours.` - [Working Time Around the World, Messenger et al., 2007](https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/@dgreports/@dcomm/@publ/documents/publication/wcms_104895.pdf)
- A 2014 paper found that:
    - `The examination of the determining factors of long-run profitability in the manufacturing sector has been largely neglected in the literature. Existing studies either overlook the internal profit dynamics of the sector for the sake of international developments or do not go beyond the application of descriptive statistics. Starting from the theoretical concepts of Marx-biased technical change and the tendential fall in the rate of profit, we intend to fill this gap with the use of multivariate cointegration analysis. A Vector Error Correction Model using a time-series dataset that covers the entire postwar era is applied to test the long-run relationship between the rate of profit and a set of variables. The analysis is extended to capital-intensive and labour-intensive industries within manufacturing. We find one true long-run relationship between the set of variables in all models. Capital intensity is found to have a negative impact on the profit rate in all models tested, providing evidence for Marx-biased technical change. The effect of real wages is also negative in the models where a statistically significant contribution is established. Labour productivity has the largest positive effect in all models and is promoted as the decisive counteracting force to the negative burdens on the rate of profit. A secular declining trend in the rate of profit cannot be confirmed.` - [Technology, distribution, and long-run profit rate dynamics in the U.S. manufacturing sector, 1948-2011: evidence from a Vector Error Correction Model (VECM), Kalogerakos, 2014](http://lup.lub.lu.se/luur/download?func=downloadFile&recordOId=4648167&fileOId=4648170)
- A 2018 paper found that:
    - `The results for this nonlinear approach reinforce previous empirical evidence that does not provide support for a systematic and declining tendency in profit rate as advanced in the Marxian literature.` `The model appears to provide a satisfactory portrayal of the evolution of the profit rate and the pattern of long swings reinforces previous rejections of the hypothesis of a consistent declining tendency of the profit rate.` - [Profit rate in the US, 1949â€“2007: a Markov switching assessment, Resende, 2018](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1080/13504851.2017.1352074)
- A 2019 paper found that:
    - `We find that from 1980 onwards, markups have risen from 21% to nearly 61% in 2014, an increase of 40 points. For the same period, average profit rates have increased from 1 percent of sales to 8 percent.` - [The Rise of Market Power and the Macroeconomic Implications, Loecker et al., 2019](http://www.janeeckhout.com/wp-content/uploads/RMP.pdf)
- A 2020 paper found that:
    - `Offsetting the large declines in the labor and capital shares is a large increase in the pure profit share.` - [Declining Labor and Capital Shares, Barkai, 2020](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/economics/sites/economics/files/barkaideclininglaborcapital.pdf)
