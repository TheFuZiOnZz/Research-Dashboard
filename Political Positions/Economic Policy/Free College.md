- Bernie supports [**Free College**](https://berniesanders.com/issues/free-college-cancel-debt/), **which isn't necessarily bad**, but he supports it for every single person in the US.
- It forces taxpayers to **foot the bill for even wealthy students**, which [constitute a significant portion of college students](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/18/upshot/some-colleges-have-more-students-from-the-top-1-percent-than-the-bottom-60.html).
- It also **doesn't cover** [**living or textbook costs**](https://www.edmit.me/blog/how-much-does-the-average-college-student-spend-on-textbooks). This is **literally throwing money at the issue rather than solving it**.
- Bernie's funding plan for it **is very odd**, he said it would be funded by a [**Financial Transaction Tax**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_transaction_tax) and **that it would raise $2.4 trillion over ten years**. According to the [**Institute Of Taxation And Economic Policy**](https://itep.org/benefits-of-a-financial-transaction-tax/), it would **only raise $600 billion**, with the [**Tax Foundation**](https://taxfoundation.org/financial-transaction-tax/) saying **it would raise as low as $220 billion.**
