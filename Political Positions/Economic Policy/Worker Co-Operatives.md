- Worker Co-operatives are used as an alternative firm structure that is totally owned and run by the workers of that firm.
- Mondragón - Mondragón is used as a common example of a worker co-operative that is successful in spain making the model stand strong against traditional firms but there's one problem, It’s worker-owned, it’s not totally worker managed making Mondragón by definition not a worker co-operative.
    - `Take the most advanced case: Mondragon. It’s worker-owned, it’s not worker managed, although the management does come from the workforce often, but it’s in a market system and they still exploit workers in South America, and they do things that are harmful to the society as a whole and they have no choice. If you’re in a system where you must make a profit in order to survive, you're compelled to ignore negative externalities, effects on others.` - Chomsky. [link](https://www.counterpunch.org/2012/04/30/talking-with-chomsky/)
- Mondragón has also become more traditional over time.
    - `Mondragón was set up with the ideals of worker participation, solidarity and equality, but as the business has grown bigger and bigger, and become more and more integrated into global capitalism, its founding principles have applied only to a shrinking percentage of its workforce. In 1993, Britain’s Guardian newspaper reported that Mondragón was restructuring to get ready to compete in the European single market. It noted that “increased salary differentials, advertising campaigns in Fortune and cooperative alliances with companies like Hotpoint have had many co–op workers wondering whether in the new Mondragón Cooperative Corporation [MCC] some members are more equal than others.”` - [link](https://isreview.org/issue/93/are-workers-cooperatives-alternative-capitalism)
- The problem with a partially or totally worker managed but not worker owned firm is that if you were to allow outside private investors, workers have a conflict of interest compared to shareholders, that conflict being labor cost and profit, as labor is a cost of business and affects the profit delivered to shareholders.
    - `The board of directors of a public company has a fiduciary responsibility for executive pay levels and programs. Accordingly, public companies have independent compensation committees to oversee executive pay decisions.` - [Roadmap for an IPO: A guide to going public, PwC, 2017](https://www.pwc.com/hu/hu/szolgaltatasok/konyvvizsgalat/szamviteli-tanacsadas/kiadvanyok/roadmap_for_an_ipo.pdf)
    - `The Commission may promulgate rules to provide that the standard of conduct for all brokers, dealers, and investment advisers, when providing personalized investment advice about securities to retail customers (and such other customers as the Commission may by rule provide), shall be to act in the best interest of the customer without regard to the financial or other interest of the broker, dealer, or investment adviser providing the advice.` - [Investment Advisers Act Of 1940](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/COMPS-1878/pdf/COMPS-1878.pdf)
- Workers that manage could vote to use that investment to bolster their own personal income, necessarily decreasing profits and then not delivering on that fiduciary responsibility that is required under federal agencies such as the SEC that firms have to deliver capital gains to its shareholders when the firm makes profit.
    - `Strict care must be taken to ensure no conflict of interest arises between the fiduciary and their principal.` In the case of a firm, the fiduciary being a CEO and the principal being the board of directors and in the case of a worker co-operative, the board of directors is the workers who manage. [link](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiduciary.asp)
    - `In accordance with such rules, any material conflicts of interest shall be disclosed and may be consented to by the customer.` - [Investment Advisers Act Of 1940](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/COMPS-1878/pdf/COMPS-1878.pdf)
- Also, if the federal agency has jurisdiction over the firm, then they are not entirely managed by workers. If there is no SEC-type agency, then there is no fiduciary responsibility. If there is no fiduciary responsibility, then there is no reason to invest. If there's no reason to invest, there's no company expansion.
- Marx argued that socialism in one country is impossible because a socialist revolution that does not spread will either be crushed from the outside or survive by being transformed from within. Socialism in one workplace is even more of a non-starter, because the economic, political, and military power of the existing ruling class remains in place.
    - `At the same time the experience of the period from 1848 to 1864 has proved beyond doubt that, however excellent in principle and however useful in practice, co-operative labor, if kept within the narrow circle of the casual efforts of private workmen, will never be able to arrest the growth in geometrical progression of monopoly, to free the masses, nor even to perceptibly lighten the burden of their miseries.` - [Inaugural Address of the International Working Men’s Association, Marx, 1864](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1864/10/27.htm)
- Because co-operative by themselves do not challenge the system and may divert energy away from doing so, Marx noted that a variety of establishment figures had become supporters of co-operative.
    - `It is perhaps for this very reason that plausible noblemen, philanthropic middle-class spouters, and even kept political economists have all at once turned nauseously complimentary to the very co-operative labor system they had vainly tried to nip in the bud by deriding it as the utopia of the dreamer, or stigmatizing it as the sacrilege of the socialist.` - [Inaugural Address of the International Working Men’s Association, Marx, 1864](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1864/10/27.htm)

* The purpose of this paper is to examine whether or not worker cooperatives (WCs) suffer a competitive disadvantage relative to conventional firms (CFs) and also why WCs are rare in the economy  
* Studies of worker cooperatives in a variety of national settings indicate their failure rate is lower than conventional firms at least in the short and medium term  
* The implication of this research is that theories explaining the rarity of WCs by assuming they must suffer from some inefficiency should be discounted  
* On the other hand, existing theoretical and empirical research points to financing constraints as a key limitation on the creation of WCs, and the shift to less capital-intensive industries by US WCs also supports this conclusion  
* WCs in the United States are almost always created as new enterprises using funds from the worker-members themselves. The liability of adolescence experienced by new WCs makes this viable only where the initial capital requirements are low, the expected profit rate is high, or both. Except in circumstances like these workers are likely to choose conventional employment rather than the uncertain rewards of collective entrepreneurship  
* Notably however, these factors tending to inhibit the formation of WCs are greatly reduced when the creation occurs through the conversion of an existing firm, with the exception of portfolio diversification

[Stringham et al. 11](https://resources.uwcc.wisc.edu/community%20development/Alberta%20Co-op%20Survival.pdf)

* Studies Co-op Survival Rates in Alberta, Canada  
* Incorporation and dissolution data was examined for 127 co‐operatives incorporated from 2000 to 2009  
* Recent data shows that three year survival rates for co‐ops incorporated in 2005 and 2006 was 81.5% compared to 48% for conventional firms in Alberta  
* Co‐ops operating in the same field as other co‐ops (e.g., housing, water and sewage) generally had better survival rates than those which are more innovative  
* The majority of capital was from member shares and loans. Securing financing from the lending sector was considered challenging for more than half of respondents  
* Coordinating with different regulatory organisations was one of the most significant challenges for co‐ops in terms of maintaining their momentum, optimism and financial viability  
* Reasons for failure of co‐ops were most often cited as being rooted in external factors, particularly shifting markets and regulatory requirements. Internal factors were cited less often, but included lack of a united vision and dishonesty among members  
* The main resources respondents felt they lacked where  
  * Someone to provide mentorship and/or coordination of activities  
  * Start up capital/venture capital fund  
  * A package of available resources upon incorporation

[Burdín 14](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/001979391406700108)

* Studies the survival of worker managed firms (WMFs) and conventional firms (CFs) in Uruguay  
* After excluding microenterprises and controlling for differences in the effective tax burden faced by the two types of firms, the hazard of dissolution is 29% lower for WMFs than for conventional firms  
* The higher survival rates of worker-managed firms seem to be associated with their greater employment stability  
* WMFs outperform CFs under both recessionary and expansionary macroeconomic conditions  
* The fact that WMFs survive longer may partially reflect self-selection by both WMFs into industries and workers into organisational forms

[Ministry of Economic Development, Innovation and Export in Québec 08](https://ccednet-rcdec.ca/files/ccednet/pdfs/2008-Quebec_Co-op_Survival_Report_Summary.pdf)

* Examine the survival rates of coops in Québec   
* It finds 62% of coops surviving after 5 years and 44% after 10 years  
* This statistic is relevant once compared to the survival rate of other forms of Québec business enterprise, which are 35% after 5 years and 20% after 10 years   
* This demonstrates that the survival rate of co-operatives surpasses other business enterprises by an average of 25%, during the first 10 years of operation  
* After the first year alone, only 6.7% of co-ops closed their doors, compared to 24.6% of other businesses   
* Coops retain higher survivability regardless of quantity of employees  
* Notably, the survival rate of co-ops with less than 5 employees is higher than that of cooperatives with more than 5 employees  
* Coops also survive better in rural areas than in urban ones  
* Four factors indicate that the higher survival rate is specifically due to the inherent structure of the co-op model:   
  1. The focus on member service as opposed to profit, which has an impact on business decisions   
  2. The central role of the member, who is both investor and consumer in the co-op   
  3. The democratic nature, the return of profits to members and the open governance structure of co-ops   
  4. The presence of a group of promoters rooted within the communities  
* Three factors also indicate a historical advantage, as well as the business environment of co-ops:   
  1. Strong representation in economic sectors that fulfil basic human needs, including agriculture, forestry, residential services, funeral services and education   
  2. The majority of co-ops operating in both regional and sectoral networks   
  3. Support of primary and secondary organisations, which favours improved project management of start-ups and in the development and presence of financial and fiscal tools and resources, which are adapted to the co-op model

* Examine the survival rates of coops in British Columbia  
* Overall, the survival rate of co-operatives in BC is significantly higher than that of conventional, capitalist forms of business  
* The 5-year survival rate of both operating and dissolved co-ops is 100 out of 150 co-ops (for which we have data) or 66.6%  
* By contrast, Industry Canada figures show a 43% and 39% 5-year survival rate for conventional business start-ups in 1984 and 1993 respectively

[Park et al. 04](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1016/S0885-3339\(04\)08001-9/full/html)

* This study uses data on all U.S. public companies as of 1988, following them through 2001 to examine how employee ownership is related to survival  
* Estimation using Weibull survival models shows that companies with employee ownership stakes of 5% or more were only 76% as likely as firms without employee ownership to disappear in this period, compared both to all other public companies and to a closely matched sample without employee ownership  
* While employee ownership is associated with higher productivity, the greater survival rate of these companies is not explained by higher productivity, financial strength, or compensation flexibility  
* Rather, the higher survival is linked to their greater employment stability, suggesting that employee ownership companies may provide greater employment security as part of an effort to build a more cooperative culture, which can increase employee commitment, training, and willingness to make adjustments when economic difficulties occur

# Wage Structure {#wage-structure}

[Pencavel et al. 06](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/001979390606000102)

* Investigates the differences between worker-owned and capitalist enterprises with respect to wages, employment, and capital in Italy  
* Employment was somewhat less responsive to product market shocks in co-ops than in capitalist firms, which is consistent with the notion that enterprises where workers command a greater voice will protect workers from employment reductions  
* Wages tended to be more sensitive to product market shocks in co-ops than in capitalist firms  
* In conclusion, co-ops had 14% lower wages than capitalist enterprises, on average; more volatile wages; and less volatile employment. Given the quality of the data set analysed, the authors argue, these results can be regarded as having broad generality

[Pérotin 18](https://www.uk.coop/sites/default/files/2020-10/worker_co-op_report.pdf)

* This paper reviews existing literature on worker cooperatives  
* When market conditions change worker cooperatives review wages first and keep employment more stable. In a downturn worker co-operatives drop wages rather than reducing their workforce. When business picks up they are ready to respond and can make up for lost pay because employees enjoy a share of profit  
* Worker co-ops are larger than other firms and not necessarily less capital intensive, although they may be created more often than other firms in less capital intensive industries, all else being equal  
* The reason for coops being on average larger is likely because a lot of existing cooperatives were converted from traditional firms  
* They are present in most industries and differences in industry distributions with conventional firms vary from one country to another

[Burdín et al. 09](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46490130_New_Evidence_on_wages_and_employment_in_worker_cooperatives_compared_with_capitalist_firms)

* This paper measures the comparative behaviour of worker cooperatives (WCs) and capitalist firms (CFs) in regards to wages and employment responses in Uruguay  
* The effect of output price changes on wage variations is positive for both types of firms, but larger in WCs than in CFs  
* CFs exhibit a well-defined and negative relationship between wages and employment  
* By contrast, WCs display a well-defined and positive relationship between wages and employment  
* The 2002 crisis negatively affected both wages and employment, although the employment adjustment was larger in CFs than in WCs. CFs would produce a socially inefficient level of lay-offs due to their inability to establish credible commitments between owners and workers  
* By contrast, because of their unique control structure, WCs would have more egalitarian adjustment mechanisms at their disposal

[Burdín 15](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ecoj.12272)

* This paper studies the effects of the more compressed worker managed firm (WMFs) compensation structures and what effects they have on employment  
* The paper has 2 key findings  
* Firstly, is a small wage premium associated with being employed in a WMF, which declines significantly with increasing wage  
* Secondly, WMFs suffer from brain drain: the separation hazard of high-ability members is more than three times higher than that of low-ability members  
* Moreover it finds that there is a relationship between the extent of pay compression and the severity of brain drain in WMFs: high-ability workers are less likely to exit a WMF whose wage structure is less compressed  
* The explanation for this is likely that these high ability workers would be able to attain a higher wage in a non WMF as the wages are less compressed  
* There is one notable exception to this pattern, that being high-ability workers who also were founding members, these high-ability workers have a far lower separation hazard rate than other high-ability workers  
* However, the costs of equality associated with brain drain and inferior management quality may be outweighed by other labour discipline benefits, such as higher motivation of shop-floor workers, greater workplace cooperation and lower supervision costs

[Logue et al. 05](https://community-wealth.org/sites/clone.community-wealth.org/files/downloads/article-logue-yates.pdf)

* Examines productivity and survivability of worker cooperatives  
* Worker cooperatives and other employee owned enterprises generally pay wages that are competitive or better than locally prevailing wages when profit-sharing, bonuses and dividends are included  
* Coops are less likely to lay off workers during economic downturns, prefeing to share to work, even accepting a lower price of the product in order to remain in the market and maintain production and employment  
* They tend to offer better fringe benefits than conventional companies in their field

# Productivity {#productivity}

[Logue et al. 05](https://community-wealth.org/sites/clone.community-wealth.org/files/downloads/article-logue-yates.pdf)

* Examines productivity and survivability of worker cooperatives  
* Considerable evidence from the developed countries shows that participatory worker cooperatives and employee-owned firms can match or exceed the productivity of conventional firms  
* The survival rate of worker cooperatives and employee-owned firms appears to equal or surpass that of conventional firms  
* It seems clear from the empirical literature that farm and business cooperatives have a net positive impact on value added per hour worked when both the cooperative and its member units are included in the analysis  
* In sum, there is no great accumulation of evidence to suggest that cooperatives and employee-owned enterprises are less productive than conventional firms, and substantial evidence that they at least equal, and probably exceed, the productivity of their conventional counterparts

[O'Boyle et al. 16](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1748-8583.12115)

* A meta‐analysis of 102 samples representing 56,984 firms aimed at studying the effects of employee ownership on productivity  
* The analysis found that Employee ownership has a small, but positive and statistically significant relation to firm performance ( ![urn:x-wiley:09545395:media:hrmj12115:hrmj12115-math-0001][image1] = 0.04)  
* The effect is generally positive for studies with different sampling designs (samples assessing change in performance pre‐employee–post‐employee ownership adoption or samples on firms with employee ownership), different performance operationalisation (efficiency or growth) and firm type (publicly held or privately held)  
* It found no differences in effects on performance in publicly held versus privately held firms, stock or stock option‐based ownership plans or differences in effects across different firm sizes (i.e. number of employees)  
* It found that the effect of employee ownership on performance has increased in studies over time and that studies with samples from outside the USA report stronger effects than those within  
* There is a possibility of bias in sampling where employees in ownership firms are less likely to respond than employees in non-ownership firms  
* Additionally, among the pool of employees, employees most influenced by employee ownership may also be more likely to respond  
* However, it finds little to no evidence of publication bias  
* In closing, by drawing on studies from multiple disciplines that include samples from firms around the world, the present meta-analysis provides more generalizable inferences on the role of employee ownership on performance

[Fakhfakh et al. 12](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281599834_Productivity_Capital_and_Labor_in_Labor-Managed_and_Conventional_Firms)

* The paper compares the productivity of labour-managed and conventional firms using two new panel data sets covering several thousand firms from France, including representative samples of conventional firms and all worker cooperatives with 20 employees or more in manufacturing and services  
* It finds worker cooperatives to be as productive or possibly more productive overall than conventional firms in most industries  
* These findings suggest that the way in which worker cooperatives organise production is probably more productive overall than conventional firms’ way  
* In several industries, French worker cooperatives produce in such a way that they use their current inputs better than conventional firms, which could produce more at their current levels of inputs if they behaved in the same way as worker cooperatives  
* Univariate comparisons show that worker cooperatives are not smaller than conventional firms in all industries and are observed to expand their capital at least as fast as conventional firms  
* Although we find consistent evidence that worker cooperatives are at least as productive as conventional firms and do not produce at inefficient scale, behaviours observed for both types of firms, as well as differences between the two groups, seem to vary across time periods and stages in the business cycle, and are not entirely homogeneous across industries

[Monteiro et al. 18](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/apce.12201)

* This paper analyses the relative productive efficiency between cooperatives and investor owned firms in Portugal  
* Utilises two calculation systems to reach its results  
* The first system (the benchmark random‐effects model) suggests that cooperatives are, on average, considerably less productive than their investor-owned counterparts, and this result applies to a majority of the thirteen industries considered  
* The second, author preferred, System‐GMM calculation system is much less conclusive, and does not conclude that cooperatives are generally less efficient that investor‐owned firms  
* Nevertheless it finds no evidence that cooperatives are more productive than investor‐owned firms in any industry.  
* Notably, the research does not conflict with the general idea that cooperatives have significantly higher survival rates  
* This data seems to suggest that the performance in productivity for worker cooperatives is highly dependant and varies greatly depending on the industry

# Worker satisfaction and wellbeing {#worker-satisfaction-and-wellbeing}

[Coad et al. 14](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165176514001980)

* This study analyzes the causal linkages between well-being, income, health problems, worries, autonomy and hours worked in the job for working German individuals from 1984-2008  
* Given that autonomy and hours worked are the key causal drivers, it seems that individuals first choose their career trajectory in terms of autonomy or personal freedom, then decide how much to work (intensity down this trajectory), and well-being (work satisfaction and life satisfaction) is the result of these decisions.   
* Finding that autonomy is such an important non-pecuniary determinant of individual well-being is consistent with the predictions of self-determination theory and prompts a more prominent role for autonomy in labour economics  
* Individuals aiming at improving their workplace and general well-being are well advised to seek out work that allows them room for self-determined action and discretion

[Sabatini et al. 13](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11187-013-9494-8)

* Investigates the role of cooperative enterprise in in the creation of social trust in Italy  
* The findings suggest that, unlike any other type of enterprise, cooperatives have a particular ability to foster the development of social trust  
* This supports the view that the development of cooperative enterprises—and, more generally, of less hierarchical models of governance and of enterprises that do not aim purely to maximise profit—may play a crucial role in the diffusion of trust and in the accumulation of social capital  
* Trust reduces uncertainty and transaction costs, enforces contracts, and facilitates credit at the level of individual investors, thereby enhancing the efficiency of exchanges and encouraging investment in ideas, human capital and physical capital  
* The cross sectional design of the survey has prevented it from controlling for fixed effects at the individual level. In addition, it did not carry out fully randomised experiments, and it has not been able to isolate suitable instrumental variables  
* Hence, it cannot exclude the existence of some form of endogeneity leading to inconsistent estimates

* Investigates the relationships between job demands and job search behaviours in regards to employee attitudes and behaviours for cooperatives in Seoul, South Korea  
* The findings revealed that worker cooperatives moderated the relationship between job demands and organisational commitment  
* In other words, while the negative relationship between job demands and organisational commitment was significant in capitalist firms, it was not maintained in worker cooperatives  
* A potential limitation of the present study is that individual-level variables were measured by self-reports

* This paper examines job satisfaction and participation in decision making in three home health aide facilities with different organisational structures (worker-owned for-profit, for-profit with no participation or ownership by workers, and nonprofit)  
* More than 600 surveys were completed by home health aides across the three facilities. The author also engaged in participant observation during training sessions and other meetings and conducted a small number of interviews with caregivers and agency management  
* Home health aides at the worker-owned, participative decision making organisation were significantly more satisfied with their jobs  
* This study involved respondents from one of each type of business  
* A study across several of each type of organisation would allow more focus on the effects of the structural characteristics of the organisations

[Blasi et al. 15](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjir.12135)

* Studies the effect of employee ownership on company culture and function  
* The analysis of the data set finds that shared ownership forms of pay are associated with high-trust supervision, participation in decisions, and information sharing, and with a variety of positive perceptions of company culture  
* It is also associated with lower voluntary turnover and higher return on equity  
* The random-effects estimates mainly reflect comparisons between rather than within firms, raising the possibility that there are unobserved firm characteristics that help account for the findings  
* Nevertheless, these results indicate that group incentives are likely to have positive effects if implemented in the appropriate way – with supportive HR policies rather than on their own  
* Additionally these results indicate that public policy supporting group incentives, which may be motivated by a concern to increase middle class incomes and share the rewards of economic performance more broadly, is unlikely to harm and may even improve economic performance

* Investigates 2 major cooperative leagues (Mondragon in Spain and La Lega in Italy) and the way they interact with other cooperatives and form economies of scale  
* The findings suggest that coops perform better in markets which have a pre-established cooperative league  
* On the one hand it seems that players would have an incentive to form such a league since they can look forward and calculate the incentives of other players to participate in this league once it has exceeded some critical threshold  
* On the other hand, if the cost of forming such a league is borne primarily by the early movers, then players would have an incentive to wait and let others go first  
* As such the absence of cooperative leagues is believed to be a disincentive for the formation of new cooperatives
