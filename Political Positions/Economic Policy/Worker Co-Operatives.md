- Worker Co-operatives are used as an alternative firm structure that is totally owned and run by the workers of that firm.
- Mondragón - Mondragón is used as a common example of a worker co-operative that is successful in spain making the model stand strong against traditional firms but there's one problem, It’s worker-owned, it’s not totally worker managed making Mondragón by definition not a worker co-operative.
    - `Take the most advanced case: Mondragon. It’s worker-owned, it’s not worker managed, although the management does come from the workforce often, but it’s in a market system and they still exploit workers in South America, and they do things that are harmful to the society as a whole and they have no choice. If you’re in a system where you must make a profit in order to survive, you're compelled to ignore negative externalities, effects on others.` - Chomsky.

- Mondragón has also become more traditional over time.
    - `Mondragón was set up with the ideals of worker participation, solidarity and equality, but as the business has grown bigger and bigger, and become more and more integrated into global capitalism, its founding principles have applied only to a shrinking percentage of its workforce. In 1993, Britain’s Guardian newspaper reported that Mondragón was restructuring to get ready to compete in the European single market. It noted that “increased salary differentials, advertising campaigns in Fortune and cooperative alliances with companies like Hotpoint have had many co–op workers wondering whether in the new Mondragón Cooperative Corporation [MCC] some members are more equal than others.”` - [link](https://isreview.org/issue/93/are-workers-cooperatives-alternative-capitalism)
- The problem with a partially or totally worker managed but not worker owned firm is that if you were to allow outside private investors, workers have a conflict of interest compared to shareholders, that conflict being labor cost and profit, as labor is a cost of business and affects the profit delivered to shareholders.
    - `The board of directors of a public company has a fiduciary responsibility for executive pay levels and programs. Accordingly, public companies have independent compensation committees to oversee executive pay decisions.` - [Roadmap for an IPO: A guide to going public, PwC, 2017](https://www.pwc.com/hu/hu/szolgaltatasok/konyvvizsgalat/szamviteli-tanacsadas/kiadvanyok/roadmap_for_an_ipo.pdf)
    - `The Commission may promulgate rules to provide that the standard of conduct for all brokers, dealers, and investment advisers, when providing personalized investment advice about securities to retail customers (and such other customers as the Commission may by rule provide), shall be to act in the best interest of the customer without regard to the financial or other interest of the broker, dealer, or investment adviser providing the advice.` - [Investment Advisers Act Of 1940](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/COMPS-1878/pdf/COMPS-1878.pdf)
- Workers that manage could vote to use that investment to bolster their own personal income, necessarily decreasing profits and then not delivering on that fiduciary responsibility that is required under federal agencies such as the SEC that firms have to deliver capital gains to its shareholders when the firm makes profit.
    - `Strict care must be taken to ensure no conflict of interest arises between the fiduciary and their principal.` In the case of a firm, the fiduciary being a CEO and the principal being the board of directors and in the case of a worker co-operative, the board of directors is the workers who manage.

    - `In accordance with such rules, any material conflicts of interest shall be disclosed and may be consented to by the customer.` - [Investment Advisers Act Of 1940](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/COMPS-1878/pdf/COMPS-1878.pdf)
- Also, if the federal agency has jurisdiction over the firm, then they are not entirely managed by workers. If there is no SEC-type agency, then there is no fiduciary responsibility. If there is no fiduciary responsibility, then there is no reason to invest. If there's no reason to invest, there's no company expansion.
- Marx argued that socialism in one country is impossible because a socialist revolution that does not spread will either be crushed from the outside or survive by being transformed from within. Socialism in one workplace is even more of a non-starter, because the economic, political, and military power of the existing ruling class remains in place.
    - `At the same time the experience of the period from 1848 to 1864 has proved beyond doubt that, however excellent in principle and however useful in practice, co-operative labor, if kept within the narrow circle of the casual efforts of private workmen, will never be able to arrest the growth in geometrical progression of monopoly, to free the masses, nor even to perceptibly lighten the burden of their miseries.` - [Inaugural Address of the International Working Men’s Association, Marx, 1864](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1864/10/27.htm)
- Because co-operative by themselves do not challenge the system and may divert energy away from doing so, Marx noted that a variety of establishment figures had become supporters of co-operative.
    - `It is perhaps for this very reason that plausible noblemen, philanthropic middle-class spouters, and even kept political economists have all at once turned nauseously complimentary to the very co-operative labor system they had vainly tried to nip in the bud by deriding it as the utopia of the dreamer, or stigmatizing it as the sacrilege of the socialist.` - [Inaugural Address of the International Working Men’s Association, Marx, 1864](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1864/10/27.htm)
