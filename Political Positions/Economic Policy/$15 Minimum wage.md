### $15 Minimum wage
- Trump has given a number of contradictory statements on whether he would support increasing the federal minimum wage. In 2015, Trump said he wanted to `keep the minimum wage pretty much where it is right now` in an interview with MSNBC, and two months later told Fox News that a New York proposal to raise its lowest wage to $15 an hour was `too high.` But in November and December of that year, Trump said wages were `too low` and told Fox News he supported a $15.

- Pew Research found that Americans’ paychecks are bigger than 40 years ago, but their purchasing power has hardly budged. `Despite the strong labor market, wage growth has lagged economists’ expectations. In fact, despite some ups and downs over the past several decades, today’s real average wage (that is, the wage after accounting for inflation) has about the same purchasing power it did 40 years ago. And what wage gains there have been have mostly flowed to the highest-paid tier of workers.` [link](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/08/07/for-most-us-workers-real-wages-have-barely-budged-for-decades/)
- The Economic Policy Institute reported in December 2019 that: `Working people saw no discernible wage increase due to the Tax Act. The tight labor market and higher state-level minimum wages can explain the wage growth in 2018.` In reference to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.

- Biden Is in support of `Increase the federal minimum wage to $15. As Vice President, Biden helped get state and local laws increasing the minimum wage across the finish line – including in New York State – and has supported eliminating the tipped minimum wage. He firmly believes all Americans are owed a raise, and it’s well past time we increase the federal minimum wage to $15 across the country.` [link](https://joebiden.com/empowerworkers/)
- Biden Is in support of `Ensure federal dollars do not flow to employers who engage in union-busting activities, participate in wage theft, or violate labor law. Biden will institute a multi-year federal debarment for all employers who illegally oppose unions, building on debarment efforts pursued in the Obama-Biden Administration. Biden will also restore and build on the Obama-Biden Administration’s Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces executive order, which Trump revoked, requiring employers’ compliance with labor and employment laws be taken into account in determining whether they are sufficiently responsible to be entrusted with federal contracts.` [link](https://joebiden.com/empowerworkers/)
- Biden Is in support to `Aggressively pursue employers who violate labor laws, participate in wage theft, or cheat on their taxes by intentionally misclassifying employees as independent contractors. As president, Biden will put a stop to employers intentionally misclassifying their employees as independent contractors. He will enact legislation that makes worker misclassification a substantive violation of law under all federal labor, employment, and tax laws with additional penalties beyond those imposed for other violations.` [link](https://joebiden.com/empowerworkers/)
