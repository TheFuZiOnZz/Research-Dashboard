# Liberalization of Trade
- A 2004 paper found that:
    - `Theory provides a strong presumption that trade liberalization will be poverty-alleviating in the long run and on average. The empirical evidence broadly supports this view, and, in particular, lends no support to the position that trade liberalization generally has an adverse impact.` - [Trade Liberalization and Poverty: The Evidence So Far, Winters et al., 2004](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1257/002205104773558056)
- A 2006 World Bank paper found that:
    - `The estimated average increase in growth varies between 1.2 and 2.6 percent according to which specification we use to take into account the evolution of other growth determinants and is statistically significant under all specifications.` - [Growth Before And After Trade Liberalization, Salinas and Aksoy, 2006](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/8864/wps4062.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y)
- A 2008 World Bank paper found that:
    - `Over the 1950–98 period, countries that liberalized their trade regimes experienced average annual growth rates that were about 1.5 percentage points higher than before liberalization. Postliberalization investment rates rose 1.5–2.0 percentage points, confirming past findings that liberalization fosters growth in part through its effect on physical capital accumulation. Liberalization raised the average trade to GDP ratio by roughly 5 percentage points, after controlling for year effects, suggesting that trade policy liberalization did indeed raise the actual level of openness of liberalizers.` - [Trade Liberalization and Growth: New Evidence, Wacziarg and Welch, 2008](http://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/660841468162283031/pdf/775730JRN020080alization0and0Growth.pdf)
- A 2014 literature review found that:
    - `The literature of the past decade reinforces the presumption that trade liberalization generally raises average incomes (i.e., boosts economic growth temporarily), and shows that the response to trade liberalization is likely to vary with a series of complementary conditions, many of which refer to the ease with which factors of production can migrate between sectors.`[Trade Liberalization and Poverty: What Have We Learned in a Decade?, Winters and Martuscelli, 2014](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1146/annurev-resource-110713-105054)
- A 2016 paper found that:
    - `The multi-sector analysis reveals that the gains from trade are typically biased towards the poor. This is because the poor tend to concentrate expenditures in sectors that are more traded, and because these sectors have lower price elasticities` - [Measuring the Unequal Gains from Trade, Fajgelbaum and Khandelwal, 2014](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w20331/w20331.pdf)
# Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership
- The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) was a proposed trade agreement between the European Union and the United States.
- The TTIP would have increased the EU's economy by €120 billion, the US's economy by €90 billion, and the rest of the world by €100 billion, this would translate to an extra €545 in disposable income per family in the EU, and €655 per family in the US.

# Trans-Pacific Partnership
- The now dead, Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP) was a proposed trade agreement between Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, Vietnam, and the United States signed on 4 February 2016. After the newly elected US president Donald Trump withdrew the US signature from TPP in January 2017, the agreement could not be ratified as required and did not enter into force. The remaining countries negotiated a new trade agreement called Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, which incorporates most of the provisions of the TPP and which entered into force on 30 December 2018.
- In 2016, the U.S. International Trade Commission report on its projection of the TPP was positive on all fronts.
    - Economy-Wide effects, `the TPP Agreement would increase annual U.S. GDP in 2032 relative to the 2032 baseline by $42.7 billion in 2017 dollars, or by 0.15 percent of total U.S. GDP` - [Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement: Likely Impact on the U.S. Economy and on Specific Industry Sectors, United States International Trade Commission, 2016](https://www.usitc.gov/publications/332/pub4607.pdf)
    - Broad Sector Level Effects, `While output and employment would increase in the overall economy due to TPP, this change would be driven by expansion in the agriculture and food sector and the services sector. In dollar terms, the output of the services sector would expand the most ($42.3 billion) relative to its baseline volume in 2032` - [Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement: Likely Impact on the U.S. Economy and on Specific Industry Sectors, United States International Trade Commission, 2016](https://www.usitc.gov/publications/332/pub4607.pdf)
    - Industry Level Effects, `Sectors benefiting from the most extensive liberalization measures tend to expand production and exports as they become relatively more competitive in the world economy: these are the direct effects of TPP.` - [Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement: Likely Impact on the U.S. Economy and on Specific Industry Sectors, United States International Trade Commission, 2016](https://www.usitc.gov/publications/332/pub4607.pdf)
- In 2016, the World Bank found that,
    - `By shifting resources towards the most productive firms and sectors and expanding export markets, TPP has the potential to lift overall GDP of member countries by 1.1 percent by 2030.` - [Potential Macroeconomic Implications Of The Trans-Pacific Partnership, Global Economic Prospects, 2016](https://web.archive.org/web/20160212030617/http://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/Worldbank/GEP/GEP2016a/Global-Economic-Prospects-January-2016-Implications-Trans-Pacific-Partnership-Agreement.pdf)
    - `TPP could also lift member countries’ trade by 11 percent by 2030.` - [Potential Macroeconomic Implications Of The Trans-Pacific Partnership, Global Economic Prospects, 2016](https://web.archive.org/web/20160212030617/http://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/Worldbank/GEP/GEP2016a/Global-Economic-Prospects-January-2016-Implications-Trans-Pacific-Partnership-Agreement.pdf)
- In 2016, the Office of the Chief Economist at Global Affairs Canada found that,
    - `Joining the TPP would provide a net advantage to Canada resulting from increased market access and greater regional economic integration with Asia-Pacific countries. Should Canada choose to be a party to the TPP Agreement, this is projected to boost Canada’s GDP by a permanent 0.127 percent above baseline performance, generating GDP gains of $4.3 billion (US$3.3 billion) in the longer term (by 2040).` - [Economic Impact of Canada’s Potential Participation in the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement, 2021](https://www.international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/economist-economiste/analysis-analyse/tpp_ei-re_ptp.aspx?lang=eng)
    - `According to our modelling results, should Canada choose to remain outside the TPP Agreement, and all other current TPP members are parties to it, this is projected to lead to GDP losses of $5.3 billion (US$ 4.2 billion).` - [Economic Impact of Canada’s Potential Participation in the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement, 2021](https://www.international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/economist-economiste/analysis-analyse/tpp_ei-re_ptp.aspx?lang=eng)
# Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership
- The Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), is a trade agreement among Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, and Vietnam. It evolved from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which never entered into force due to the withdrawal of the United States.
- In 2018, the Office of the Chief Economist at Global Affairs Canada found that,
    - `Joining the CPTPP is expected to provide a net advantage to Canada resulting from increased market access and greater regional economic integration with Asia-Pacific countries. The CPTPP is projected to boost Canada’s GDP by $4.2 billion in the longer term (i.e. by 2040). This is significantly higher than the GDP gains of $3.4 billion that were projected under the TPP that included the United States. This increase in GDP is driven by increases in exports of goods and services, and by increases in investment.` - [Economic impact of Canada’s participation in the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, 2018](https://www.international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/cptpp-ptpgp/impact-repercussions.aspx?lang=eng)
# North American Free Trade Agreement
- The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was an agreement signed by Canada, Mexico, and the United States that created a trilateral trade bloc in North America.
- A 2001 Paper found that:
    - `U.S. real gross domestic product (GDP) fell slightly from 1990 to 1991, but grew steadily from 1992 onward, coinciding with the implementation of NAFTA` `The mainstream forecasts during the NAFTA debate were basically correct: NAFTA has had relatively small positive effects on the U.S. economy and relatively large positive effects on Mexico. ` - [The Impact of NAFTA on the United States, Burfisher et al., 2001](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.15.1.125)
- A 2017 Paper found that:
    - `It estimated that NAFTA likely increased annual U.S. GDP, but by a very small amount—“probably no more than a few billion dollars, or a few hundredths of a percent.”` - [The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Congressional Research Service and Villarreal, 2017](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R42965.pdf)
# United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement
- United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA) is a free trade agreement between Canada, Mexico, and the United States which replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
- In 2019, the U.S. International Trade Commission report found that:
    - `The Commission’s model estimates that USMCA would raise U.S. real GDP by $68.2 billion (0.35 percent) and U.S. employment by 176,000 jobs (0.12 percent). The model estimates that USMCA would likely have a positive impact on U.S. trade, both with USMCA partners and with the rest of the world. U.S. exports to Canada and Mexico would increase by $19.1 billion (5.9 percent) and $14.2 billion (6.7percent), respectively.` - [U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement: Likely Impact on the U.S. Economy and on Specific Industry Sectors, United States and International Trade Commission, 2019](https://www.usitc.gov/publications/332/pub4889.pdf)
