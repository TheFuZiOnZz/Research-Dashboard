### Notes
- Elinor Ostrom’s work on common pool resources show thoroughly that bottom-up approaches of consensus and agreement are what allow such approaches to work. While not explicitly socialist, her work does show people overcoming the tragedy of the commons (which is a common argument against socialism) for a long time, sometimes _hundreds_ of years.
- USSR was playing catch-up utilizing technology developed under capitalism. Growth rates tapered off as its industry matured. Failed to develop an internet because of infighting.
- Censorship of science under the USSR: most obvious fields that were suppressed were genetics, cybernetics and physics. USSR also censored photocopier which made communication difficult because they feared uprising
- Stafford Beer’s Cybersyn was built using cybernetic principles and rejected centralized planning so the system could be more adaptive
- 20th century `communist` regimes all failed miserably and at best, were little better than colonial capitalism. In their wake they left deeply reactionary societies and their ruling elites flipped to fascists almost overnight
- Nation-states’ military doctrines, often based on vertical command structure, are slow to respond to decentralised warfare by non-state actors
