## Progressive Income Tax
- A progressive income tax is a tax on income in which the tax rate increases as the taxable amount increases.
### 1979 Thatcher Tax Cuts
- In the first budget after her election victory in 1979, the top rate was reduced from 83% to 60% and the basic rate from 33% to 30%. [link]
- The Thatcher Poll tax was a system of taxation introduced by Margaret Thatcher‘s government in 1989/90. It provided for a single flat-rate, per-capita tax on every adult, at a rate set by the local authority. People in employment had to pay 100% of the tax, while students and the registered unemployed paid 20% of the tax. [link]
- UK unemployment rose after the poll tax was implemented and lowered after it was removed by John Major in 1993 and replaced with council tax. March 1990: 6.9%, March 1993: 10.5%. [link]
- UK GDP fell to stagnant and negative levels after the poll tax was implemented and flowed after it was removed by John Major in 1993 and replaced with council tax. [link]

### 2001 Bush Tax Cuts
- Bush’s tax bills (`Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001` and `Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003`) reduced the marginal income tax rate from 39.6% to 35%.
- In 2017, a Center on Budget and Policy Priorities report found that,
    - `Job growth, economic growth, and small business job creation were much weaker following the George W. Bush tax cuts, which gave the biggest boosts to high-income households, than after the Clinton tax increases on high-income households.` - [Tax Cuts for the Rich Aren’t an Economic Panacea — and Could Hurt Growth, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, 2017](https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/tax-cuts-for-the-rich-arent-an-economic-panacea-and-could-hurt-growth)
    - `After the Bush tax cuts for the very highest-income households expired at the end of 2012, the economy continued to grow and add jobs steadily.` - [Tax Cuts for the Rich Aren’t an Economic Panacea — and Could Hurt Growth, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, 2017](https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/tax-cuts-for-the-rich-arent-an-economic-panacea-and-could-hurt-growth)
    - `The Bush tax cuts included sharp tax cuts on capital gains and dividends that proponents said would spur immediate business growth, but a recent study found “empirical evidence that the 2003 tax cuts had little impact on investment or employment.” And, in the words of The Wall Street Journal, Federal Reserve economists found the 2003 tax cut "was a dud when it came to boosting the stock market."` - [Tax Cuts for the Rich Aren’t an Economic Panacea — and Could Hurt Growth, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, 2017](https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/tax-cuts-for-the-rich-arent-an-economic-panacea-and-could-hurt-growth)
    - `The drag from deficit-increasing tax cuts for the wealthy on the economy is a key reason why the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that allowing the high-income Bush tax cuts to expire and using the savings to cut the deficit would improve long-term economic growth.` - [Tax Cuts for the Rich Aren’t an Economic Panacea — and Could Hurt Growth, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, 2017](https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/tax-cuts-for-the-rich-arent-an-economic-panacea-and-could-hurt-growth)
### 2017 Trump Tax Cuts
- On his first day in office, Trump reversed a middle class tax cut in mortgage insurance premiums issued by the Federal Housing Administration. These insurance fees are effectively a tax on middle-class homeownership. For a mortgage worth $200,000, this adds $500 to a homebuyer’s annual costs.

- Trump's tax proposal (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017) would reduce the corporate tax rate to 20% from 35%. The Trump Treasury Department released a one-page summary of the nearly 500-page Senate tax bill that suggested the tax cut would more than pay for itself, based on an assumption of higher economic growth than any independent analysis had forecast. [link](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/11/us/politics/treasury-tax.html) Every detailed, independent analysis found that the enacted tax cut would increase budget deficits. [link](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/15/business/economy/survey-trump-economy.html)
- The CBO estimated in April 2018 that implementing the Act would add an estimated $2.289 trillion to the national debt over ten years. [link](https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/115th-congress-2017-2018/reports/53651-outlook.pdf\#page=133)
- Analysis conducted by The New York Times in November 2019 found that average business investment was lower after the tax cut than before, and that firms receiving larger tax relief increased investment less than firms receiving smaller tax relief. The analysis also found that since the tax cut firms increased dividends and stock buybacks by nearly three times as much as they increased capital investments.

- A study found ‘379 large, profitable U.S. companies in 2018 paid an effective tax rate of 11.3%’, the first year the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was in force. That's slightly more than half of the nominal corporate tax rate of 21%, which itself was reduced by the TCJA from a previous rate of 35%. [link](https://itep.org/corporate-tax-avoidance-in-the-first-year-of-the-trump-tax-law/)
- Trump’s Treasury Department has been on record for Deleted Research That Contradicts Republicans on Tax Reform. 
	- `In an interview on Fox News last month, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin made a sales pitch for the GOP’s tax reform plan—specifically, its plan to cut corporate taxes. `Most economists believe that over 70 percent of corporate taxes are paid for by the workers,` he said. His implication, in layman's terms: Regular workers would get 70 percent of the benefit of corporate tax cuts.` - [link](https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2017/10/trumps-treasury-department-deleted-research-that-contradicts-republicans-on-tax-reform/)
- Another study found 83% of the benefits of the Trump tax bill will go to the top 1%.
    - `We find the bill would reduce taxes on average for all income groups in both 2018 and 2025.` ` On average, in 2027 taxes would change little for lower- and middle-income groups and decrease for higher-income groups. Compared to current law, 5 percent of taxpayers would pay more tax in 2018, 9 percent in 2025, and 53 percent in 2027.` - [link](https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/distributional-analysis-conference-agreement-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act)
### General Papers on Taxation Effects
- A 1983 paper found that:
    - `The rapid increases in Swedish payroll taxes, occurring especially during the 70s, were presumably based on the notion of backward shifting. The evidence given in this paper suggests that the payroll tax increases were partly shifted back as lower wage increases, but that this shifting was far from complete. The estimates indicate that about 50 percent of a payroll tax increase was directly shifted back within one year.` - [Payroll Taxes and Wage Inflation: The Swedish Experience, Holmlund, 1983](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/94678/1/wp068.pdf)
- A 1987 paper found that:
    - `Our principal conclusions are two. First, while the introduction of an actuarially fair Social Security system leads to a significant increase in lifetime consumption and welfare, accompanied by a reduction in the capital stock, the gain is reduced-and in some cases eliminated-in the presence of realistic restrictions on borrowing. Extending the model to general equilibrium, we find that the partial-equilibrium gains in lifetime welfare from participation in Social Security are offset by the interaction of higher steady-state interest rates and binding liquidity constraints. Indeed, the steady-state welfare cost of Social Security under proportional payroll tax finance can be substantial. Second, replacing the proportional payroll tax with a progressive tax (essentially a linear tax with an exemption), we show that age-specific tax schemes can restore much of the potential gain from participating in Social Security.` - [Social Security and Individual Welfare: Precautionary Saving, Borrowing Constraints, and the Payroll Tax, Hubbard and Judd, 1987](https://sci-hub.ee/https://www.jstor.org/stable/1814536)
- A 2001 paper found that:
    - `Using longitudinal data over the 80s, and comparing years of increasing minimum costs with years of decreasing minimum costs, we show the negative effect of minimum cost increases on the employment of minimum wage workers. Our estimates, based on a difference-indifference, approach suggest that the elasticity of labor demand is roughly equal to –1.5 for this group. A similar analysis of the re-employment impact of tax subsidies gives small and insignificant positive effects on minimum wage workers. In fact, it seems that all workers in the tax subsidy zone benefit from the cost decreases.` - [The impact of differential payroll tax subsidies on minimum wage employment, Kramarz and Philippon, 2001](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/21065/1/dp219.pdf)
- A 2000 paper found that:
    - `Our estimates imply that a country contemplating a move to full experience rating might expect UI claim rates to fall between 10 and 33 percent, and the seasonality of this rate to fall 16–40 percent. Similarly, a drop of about 11 percent in the seasonal range of employment would be predicted. These results clearly suggest that experience rating reduces UI claims and stabilizes employment. Both of these changes mean lower unemployment and, thus, likely higher social welfare.` - [The effects of the unemployment insurance payroll tax on wages, employment, claims and denials, Anderson and Meyer, 2000](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1016/s0047-2727(99)00112-7)
- A 2007 paper found that:
    - `The evidence indicates that there may be a link between progressive taxes and higher revenues and a more equitable income distribution. The link to portfolio flows, output volatility, and growth is ambiguous. Progressive taxation does appear to be associated with larger budget deficits, but a VAT does not bring salvation. Specifically, a higher VAT is associated with more volatility. When VAT levels are considered in combination with progressive taxes, a high VAT and progressive taxation provide high revenue and high volatility, whereas the opposite is true for low VAT and progressive taxation.` - [The Benefits of Progressive Taxation in Economic Development, Weller, 2007](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1177%2F0486613407305286)
- A 2009 paper found that:
    - `We do find significant estimates of positive wage effects; the wage incidence is on average 1/4 of the payroll tax reduction. This result is also in line with previous empirical research. Our results are consistent with the interpretation that in the wage bargaining process the employers and the unions treat the cost reduction as a windfall gain which they split among themselves. That the employers are able to reap 75 percent of the gain indicates that their bargaining power markedly exceeds that of the unions.` - [Do regional payroll tax reductions boost employment?, Bennmarker et al., 2009](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/45771/1/578827638.pdf)

- A 2012 paper found that:
    - `In this paper, we estimate jointly the gross labor income responses to marginal and average tax rates for both income and payroll tax schedules. To identify the responses to the payroll tax schedule, we use the changes in the employer payroll tax reduction for low-paid jobs that occurred in France over the period 2003-2006. To identify the responses to the income tax schedule, we use the increase in working tax credit for low wage earners that took place over the same period. We find a significant elasticity of gross labor income with respect to the marginal net-of-income-tax rate around 0.2 and our results suggest that this effect is driven by married women’s labor supply decisions. Conversely, we find no significant effect of marginal net-of-payroll-tax rates on gross labor income. This discrepancy appears robust across specifications and sample selections. It is in contradiction with the prediction of identical responses to income tax and to payroll tax reforms that is common to a large class of labor market models, in particular the competitive labor supply framework, which is central in the optimal income taxation literature` - [Labor Income Responds Differently to Income-Tax and Payroll-Tax Reforms, Lehmann et al., 2012](https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/file/index/docid/856246/filename/12-017.pdf)
- A 2013 paper found that:
    - `This paper studies whether large-scale payroll tax reductions for employers of young workers is an effective means to raise youth employment. In 2007–08, payroll taxes in Sweden were cut with 11 percentage points for employers of workers at 19–25 years of age. We estimate the effect of this substantial tax cut to be, at most, an employment increase at around 2.7 percent. We find no employment effect of an extension of the original reductions, implemented in 2009. Shifting of the tax cut onto workers in the form of higher wages cannot explain the modest employment effect: the size of the wage adjustments in the wake of the reform is small, at roughly one percent. The employment and wage estimates in combination imply that the elasticity of demand for young workers in Sweden is at around −0.31. Using a different metric: the estimated cost per created job for 19–25 year-olds was SEK 1.0 to 1.6 million ($150,000 to $240,000). Since we are likely to overestimate the employment increase, these figures are most likely overly optimistic. We conclude that targeted payroll tax cuts are an expensive way to boost employment for young individuals.` - [Do payroll tax cuts raise youth employment?, Egebark and Kaunitz, 2013](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/106281/1/775177512.pdf)
- A 2019 paper found that:
    - `the stimulative effects of income tax cuts are largely driven by tax cuts for the bottom 90% and that the empirical link between employment growth and tax changes for the top 10% is weak to negligible over a business cycle frequency.` - [Tax Cuts for Whom? Heterogeneous Effects of Income Tax Changes on Growth and Employment, Zidar, 2019](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w21035/w21035.pdf)
- A 2015 report found that:
    - `States considering personal income tax cuts this legislative session should be skeptical of claims that these tax cuts will improve the state’s economic performance. In the last two decades, a number of states have cut taxes deeply in hopes of spurring economic gains, with unimpressive results. That’s not surprising given that the preponderance of the peer-reviewed academic studies indicate that state and local personal income tax levels do not affect economic performance.`
      
      `Rather than bet their futures on a tax-cutting approach that has not worked well in the past, states would do better to concern themselves with improving their schools, transportation networks, and other public services that act as building blocks of economic growth.` - [State Personal Income Tax Cuts: Still a Poor Strategy for Economic Growth, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, 2015](https://www.cbpp.org/sites/default/files/atoms/files/3-21-13sfp.pdf)
