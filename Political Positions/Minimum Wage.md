## Minimum Wage
- There are two scenarios in which are most successful and applicable to the majority of countries, an indexed minimum wage not requiring (but not discouraging) strong unions, or no minimum wage policies with strong unions and sectoral bargaining, namely the Nordic model.
- Seattle is a well studied case for indexed minimum wage which is attached to the areas Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers or CPI-W, [link](https://lni.wa.gov/workers-rights/wages/minimum-wage/history-of-washington-states-minimum-wage) and that the U.S. is known for its low membership of Unions.

- Whilst it has all the positive effects of increasing the minimum wage does, the problem is whilst adaptive to the general labor market and its median wages, it doesn't address individual sectoral downsides minimum wage might impact negatively, so whilst the average wage across an area would rise, because certain sectors cant uphold the wage for the same hours, they either cut the amount of hours or close the business.
    - `Research on the effects of minimum wage laws on low-wage workers suggests that the policy increases wages but can also lead to small reductions in hours and employment as employers adjust to higher costs` - [Responding to an Increased Minimum Wage: A Mixed Methods Study of Child Care Businesses during the Implementation of Seattle's Minimum Wage Ordinance, Otten et al., 2018](https://ejournals.bib.uni-wuppertal.de/index.php/sws/article/view/538/1063)
    - `we conclude that the second wage increase to $13 reduced hours worked in low-wage jobs by 6-7 percent, while hourly wages in such jobs increased by 3 percent.` - [Minimum Wage Increases, Wages, and Low-Wage Employment: Evidence from Seattle, Jardim et al., 2017](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w23532/w23532.pdf)
- This problem is analogous to that in the U.S, minimum wage as a federal law on the state level, that because of the varied different standards of living, a set level across the entire country has big varied economic impact, it's debatable on whether that would be net positive or negative but as the effect in general would be so big, it's safe to assume both the positive and negatives would also be big.
- The Nordic model is an example of no legally set minimum wage but strong unions with sectoral bargaining meaning that even with no minimum wage laws, the minimum wage tends to hover near 60% to 70% of the average wage in Sweden. and strong labor force protections.

    - `Unions raise wages for all types of workers. When unionized workers are compared with similar nonunionized counterparts, analysis shows union wages are about 12 percent higher.` `Union employers, compared with similar nonunion employers: Contribute 56 percent more toward workers’ retirement, Pay 77 percent more toward workers’ health care, Provide 11 percent more toward paid vacation and holidays.` - [American Workers Need Unions, Walter and Madland, 2019](https://www.americanprogressaction.org/issues/economy/reports/2019/04/02/173622/american-workers-need-unions/)
- Whilst it has all the positive effects of increasing the minimum wage does, the problem is that this results in next to no leverage for the workers in companies with no union organisation and for a country with no legal minimum wage, there's no insurance to a liveable or even received wage.
