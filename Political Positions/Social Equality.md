    - A 2016 paper found that `women are now better educated than men but they continue to lag (slightly) in actual labor market experience. In the full specification, the adjusted ratio (91.6 percent) remained considerably higher than in the human capital specification (82.1 percent) in 2011, suggesting a continued substantial role for occupation and industry in explaining the gender wage gap (recall that union differences have now been virtually eliminated).` ... `One puzzling finding in Table 4 is that, despite the occupational improvements of women shown in Table 3, gender differences in occupation accounted for a larger pay gap in 2010 than in 1980 (0.076 vs. 0.051 log points). However, while women upgraded their occupations during this period, the wage consequences of gender differences in occupations became larger as well.` - [link](https://docs.iza.org/dp9656.pdf)
