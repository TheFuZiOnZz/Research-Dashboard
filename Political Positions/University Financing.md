## Student Debt Cancellation

    - This disparity is only [**rising.**](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2014/02/11/the-rising-cost-of-not-going-to-college/)
- A February 2018 research paper from the Levy Economics Institute of Bard College argues that government cancellation student debt in the United States would result in rising consumer demand, along with economic growth and increased employment. Over the following decade, the GDP would increase by between $86 billion and $108 billion annually, which would result in an increase of between 1.2 and 1.5 million jobs and a decreased unemployment rate of 0.22 to 0.36 percent.

- In January 2019, the Federal Reserve said that student loan debt has more than doubled in the last decade, and is forcing many in the millennial generation to delay buying homes. [link](https://www.npr.org/2019/02/01/689660957/heavy-student-loan-debt-forces-many-millennials-to-delay-buying-homes)
- A 2019 survey by Bankrate found that student loan debt is also forcing millennials to delay other financial and life milestones, such as building emergency savings, saving for retirement, or paying off other debts.

- Beth Akers, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, points out that 66% of millennials have no college debt; most who do have debt proportional to their income; and that for those who drop out or fail to get a high-income job after getting an expensive degree, there are government programs that limit payments to a reasonable percentage of income and that forgive loans after 10-20 years if they cannot be repaid.

## Student Financing
- Forgiveness
- Talk about the US forgiveness policy proposal
- Problems with that
- UK student finance system
- That plus government purchasing existing debt to funnel into a finance system,
- Final solution, Government purchases existing loan debts and implements income-scaled repayment plans, funnels pre existing debtors into the finance system.
- A 2017 paper found that `There are serious problems associated with the current design of US student loans, due largely to the difficulties many students face in repaying. After all, there are considerable risks associated with the process of acquiring a college degree, and substantial uncertainty related to the individual financial returns to higher education. Loan arrangements which don’t take these uncertainties into account, such as the system in place in the US, have great potential for creating adversity for borrowers. This paper draws lessons from Australia and England to suggest how this problem can be solved. The problem arises because with a conventional loan, with fixed monthly repayments, the duration of the loan and monthly repayments do not respond to changes in income, so that the ability to pay depends crucially on having sufficient income to make these loans affordable.` - [link](https://www.researchcghe.org/perch/resources/publications/wp16.pdf)
- A 2018 paper found that `The claim that increased student aid causes tuition to rise was originated by William Bennett, the secretary of education under Ronald Reagan, in a 1987 New York Times opinion piece. Numerous academic studies since have tested the Bennett hypothesis, and though a few have found some link between rising aid and tuition in at most one sector of higher education, the vast majority have “…found not a shred of evidence of an empirical relationship,” as David Warren wrote in the Washington Post. As Warren notes, three major federal reports in the last fifteen years have each surveyed the existing academic literature, and each concluded that no such relationship exists. The most recent, conducted by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in 2011, took advantage of a unique “natural experiment” to test the Bennett hypothesis: the substantial increases in Stafford Loan limits between 2007 and 2009.22 In 2007, the yearly loan limits, adjusted for inflation, ranged from $2,925 for freshmen to $6,125 for upper classmen. By 2009, they had risen to $5,750 and $7,825, respectively. All told, the yearly borrowing limit for all undergraduates increased by an average of $2,340. However, average tuition at public 4-year universities rose by just $540 over the same two years, in line with recent historical averages, leading the GAO to reject the possibility of a relationship between the two. Additionally, these increases in borrowing limits were the first since 1993, meaning that the inflation-adjusted value of the limit had declined for more than a decade during which tuitions rose steadily. All told, both the empirical evidence and academic consensus deem the Bennett hypothesis false.` - [link](https://www.demos.org/sites/default/files/publications/Robbie%20admin-bloat.pdf)
- A 2020 paper found that `While the distributional effects of student loan forgiveness are an important aspect of student loan forgiveness, other factors may play a role in determining the desirability of debt forgiveness. Student loans may distort career choices (Rothstein and Rouse, 2011), credit constraints may hinder entrepreneurship Barrios, Hochberg and Yi, 2020), debt overhang may distort labor supply decisions (Donaldson, Piacentino and Thakor, 2019) and debt relief may have macroeconomic consequences (Auclert et al., 2019).` - [link](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/BFI_WP_2020169.pdf)
