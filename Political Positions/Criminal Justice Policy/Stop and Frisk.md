- A 2012 study finds few effects of stop-and-frisk on robbery and burglary rates in New York between 2003 and 2010. [link](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07418825.2012.712152?journalCode=rjqy20)
- A 2016 study found no evidence that stop-and-frisk was effective. One of the authors of that study, Jeffrey Fagan of Columbia University, said that `you can achieve really very positive crime control, reductions in crime, if you do stop using those probable-cause standards. If you just leave it up to the officers, based on their hunches, then they have almost no effect on crime.` - [link](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/09/22/donald-trump-claims-new-yorks-stop-and-frisk-policy-reduced-crime-the-data-disagree/) 
- Fagan `found stops based on probable cause standards of criminal behavior were associated with a 5â€“9 percent decline in NYC crime in census block groups.` - [link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4911104)
- A 2016 study found that stop-and-frisk lowered crime, and that the size of the effect was `significant yet modest`. The authors also noted that `the level of SQFs needed to produce meaningful crime reductions are costly in terms of police time and are potentially harmful to police legitimacy.` - [link](https://doi.org/10.1111%2F1745-9133.12172)
- A 2017 study also reported that stop-and-frisk was associated with modest crime reductions, and cautioned against drawing strong causal conclusions. [link](https://doi.org/10.1080%2F07418825.2016.1275748)
- A 2017 study in The Journal of Politics found that the introduction of a mandate in 2013 that officers provide thorough justifications for stopping suspects led to far fewer stops, far fewer detainments of innocent people and increased the ratio of stops that ultimately produced evidence of the crime that the police stopped the suspect for.
