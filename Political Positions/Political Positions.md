## Food Stamps
- A 2015 paper concluded that:
    - `SNAP effectively alleviates food insecurity in terms of caloric, macronutrient, and micronutrient intake. Still, SNAP participants are struggling more than income-eligible and higher-income nonparticipants to meet key dietary guidelines. Future policies should ensure that this vital food assistance program addresses diet quality while reducing food insecurity.` - [Dietary Quality of Americans by Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Participation Status: A Systematic Review, Andreyeva et al., 2015](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1016/j.amepre.2015.04.035)
- A 2015 report found that:
    - `We find that SNAP redemptions (the value of SNAP benefits redeemed by SNAP-authorized stores) had a positive average impact on county-level employment throughout the 2001 to 2014 period, with an increase of between 0.4 and 0.5 job per $10,000 of additional SNAP redemptions across all counties over the entire period.` `As expected, the impact of SNAP redemptions on employment was greater during the recession period (2008 to 2010) than either the pre-recession period (2001 to 2007) or the postrecession period (2011 to 2014) in both nonmetro and metro counties. In the recession period, SNAP redemptions contributed to about 1.0 job per $10,000 of additional SNAP redemptions in nonmetro counties and about 0.4 job per $10,000 of additional SNAP redemptions in metro counties.` - [link](https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/93169/err-263.pdf?v=1509.3) - The Impacts of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Redemptions on County-Level Employment, United States Department of Agriculture and Pender, 2019
- A 2017 study found that:
    - `The SEBTC SNAP demonstration provided SNAP-like benefits in the summer to households <185% of the federal poverty limit with children receiving the school food programs during the school year. In 2012, the $60 monthly per child benefit amounted to approximately $90 per month per household, analogous to a 25% increase in SNAP` - [link](https://www.ajpmonline.org/action/showPdf?pii=S0749-3797%2816%2930389-0) - Improving Nutrition by Increasing Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Benefits, Collins and Klerman, 2017
- A 2016 paper concluded that:
    - `Majority of vendors from each market did believe that SNAP increased sales, but the percentage of increased sales is generally not higher than 5 percent. A potentially more crucial impact of the program is an increase in customer base, and fewer vendors in each market saw their customer base increase due to SNAP acceptance. Still, a majority of vendors did feel that the customer base has increased, that number could rise if the amount of promotional materials increased, drawing in new market customers.` - [link](https://scholarworks.uark.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1002&context=scwkuht) - Analysis of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Programs in Farmers' Markets, Thomas, 2016
- A 2014 report found that:
    - `The findings of this health impact assessment suggest that many of the SNAP policy changes considered to modify how eligibility or benefit levels are determined would likely place the health of low-income Americans at greater risk.` - [link](https://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/assets/2014/11/hiahealthimpactsnapwhitepaper.pdf) - Health Impact Assessment of Proposed Changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Wernham, 2014
## Money In Politics
- A 1994 paper found that:
    
    - `This paper finds that once district-specific factors and the quality of the competing candidates are controlled for, the impact of campaign spending on election outcomes, regardless of incumbency status, is small but positive.` - [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1086/261954) - Using Repeat Challengers to Estimate the Effect of Campaign Spending on Election Outcomes in the U.S. House, Levitt, 1994
    
- A 2003 Paper found that:
    
    - `Overall, PAC contributions show relatively few effects on voting behavior. In three out of four instances, campaign contributions had no statistically significant effects on legislation or had the `wrong` sign - suggesting that more contributions lead to less support` - [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1257/089533003321164976) - Why Is There so Little Money in U.S. Politics?, Ansolabehere et al., 2003
    
- A 2004 paper concluded that:
    
    - `The experiments suggest that incumbent spending has only a negligible effect on incumbent vote margins. In contrast, the challenger’s spending appeared highly effective.` - [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1177/0002764203260415) - Does Campaign Spending Work?: Field Experiments Provide Evidence and Suggest New Theory, Gerber, 2004
    
- A 2015 Paper concluded that:
    
    - `It is almost impossible to draw any conclusions from a body of scholarship that spans several fields. It is notable, though, that regardless of the field, scholars have become increasingly focused on highly complex questions involving democratic representation, political equality, corruption, political influence, and governance. Not surprisingly, there is little consensus on these issues.` - [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1146/annurev-polisci-010814-104523) - Campaign Finance and American Democracy, Dawood, 2015
    
- A 2017 Article found that:
    
    - `In examining the relationship between early fundraising and electoral success, this article suggests that focusing on general election contests understates the true effect of fundraising on election outcomes. Fundraising matters a great deal to candidate selection. Success in the primaries is shown to be closely related to early fundraising outcomes. As the importance of primary elections has grown in recent decades, so too has the distortionary effect of early fundraising.` - [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1089/elj.2016.0413) - Professional Networks, Early Fundraising, and Electoral Success, Bonica, 2017
    
- A famous 2014 paper by Gilens & Page finds that:
    
    - `When the preferences of economic elites and the stands of organized interest groups are controlled for, the preferences of the average American appear to have only a minuscule, near-zero, statistically non-significant impact upon public policy.` - [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1017/s1537592714001595) - Testing Theories of American Politics: Elites, Interest Groups, and Average Citizens, Gilens and Page, 2014
    
- A replicated reply to the Gilens & Page paper found that when examining whether Republican and Democratic leadership were in support or opposed to this policy, rather than just examine policy adoption on its own, the conclusion differs:
    
    - `Given considerable research suggesting that public opinion can drive policy adoption...scholars have been surprised that rising economic inequality has not been associated with significant policy changes designed to redistribute income.` - [link](http://matthewg.org/Gilens-Parties4.pdf) - Oligarchy or Class War? Political Parties and Interest Groups in Unequal Public Influence on Policy Adoption, Grossmann and Isaac, 2017
    
- A 2017 reply to the Gilens & Page paper found:
    
    - `nonlinearities in the relationship between income and representation. Most dramatically, our analysis of the 2012 CCES showed that Republican representatives (though generally more responsive to higher income constituents) provided a much higher degree of representation to individuals in the 97th, 98th, and 99th percentiles. Second, our results revealed that individuals residing in Democratic districts received a fundamentally different mode of representation than those living in Republican districts. In Democratic districts, the relationship between income and representation was either negative (in the Catalist data) or generally flat with negative effects in the highest income categories (in the CCES data)` - [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1561/100.00016077) - Testing Models of Unequal Representation: Democratic Populists and Republican Oligarchs?, Rhodes and Schaffner, 2017
    
- A 2019 reply to the Gilens & Page paper found that:
    
    - `The larger the opinion supermajority, the more clear-cut the majoritarian position, the more likely the Democratic senators are to side with it and Republicans against it.` - [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1017/S0003055419000315) - The Party or the Purse?

## Falling Rate of Profit
- A 1976 paper found that:
    
    - `The above very sketchy review of the literature on Marx's law of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall has shown us that-at present-no satisfactory formulation of this law exists.` - [link](https://sci-hub.st/https://www.jstor.org/stable/1817193?seq=1) - Marx and the Falling Rate of Profit, Christiansen, 1976
    
- A 2007 journal found that:
    
    - `A more realistic estimate of annual working hours is provided by Huberman (2002), who takes into account differences in weekly working hours, paid leave and public holidays. As Figure 3.1 shows, working hours in industrialized countries were reduced dramatically in the last century. In the Netherlands, for example, workers worked 3,285 hours per year in 1870 but only 1,347 hours in 2000. Interestingly, this reduction of working hours coincided with economic progress: the period of severe economic turbulence between 1929 and 1950 was accompanied by fluctuations in working hours, sometimes involving an upward trend. Other periods such as post-World War I and post-World War II are largely characterized by progressive reductions in working hours.` - [link](https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/@dgreports/@dcomm/@publ/documents/publication/wcms_104895.pdf) - Working Time Around the World, Messenger et al., 2007
    
- A 2014 paper found that:
    
    - `The examination of the determining factors of long-run profitability in the manufacturing sector has been largely neglected in the literature. Existing studies either overlook the internal profit dynamics of the sector for the sake of international developments or do not go beyond the application of descriptive statistics. Starting from the theoretical concepts of Marx-biased technical change and the tendential fall in the rate of profit, we intend to fill this gap with the use of multivariate cointegration analysis. A Vector Error Correction Model using a time-series dataset that covers the entire postwar era is applied to test the long-run relationship between the rate of profit and a set of variables. The analysis is extended to capital-intensive and labour-intensive industries within manufacturing. We find one true long-run relationship between the set of variables in all models. Capital intensity is found to have a negative impact on the profit rate in all models tested, providing evidence for Marx-biased technical change. The effect of real wages is also negative in the models where a statistically significant contribution is established. Labour productivity has the largest positive effect in all models and is promoted as the decisive counteracting force to the negative burdens on the rate of profit. A secular declining trend in the rate of profit cannot be confirmed.` - [link](http://lup.lub.lu.se/luur/download?func=downloadFile&recordOId=4648167&fileOId=4648170) - Technology, distribution, and long-run profit rate dynamics in the U.S. manufacturing sector, 1948-2011: evidence from a Vector Error Correction Model (VECM), Kalogerakos, 2014
    
- A 2018 paper found that:
    
    - `The results for this nonlinear approach reinforce previous empirical evidence that does not provide support for a systematic and declining tendency in profit rate as advanced in the Marxian literature.` `The model appears to provide a satisfactory portrayal of the evolution of the profit rate and the pattern of long swings reinforces previous rejections of the hypothesis of a consistent declining tendency of the profit rate.` - [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1080/13504851.2017.1352074) - Profit rate in the US, 1949–2007: a Markov switching assessment, Resende, 2018
    
- A 2019 paper found that:
    
    - `We find that from 1980 onwards, markups have risen from 21% to nearly 61% in 2014, an increase of 40 points. For the same period, average profit rates have increased from 1 percent of sales to 8 percent.` - [link](http://www.janeeckhout.com/wp-content/uploads/RMP.pdf) - The Rise of Market Power and the Macroeconomic Implications, Loecker et al., 2019

## Boom Bust Cycle
- Crises have become less common over time and a higher proportion of countries in the world are growing at all times:
    
    - `The pandemic underscores the crucial value of global coordination and cooperation in public health as well as in economic policy. Cooperation across governments, and between governments, non-governmental organizations, and the private sector is necessary to help build domestic capacity to detect and respond to health crises, as well as develop and disseminate global public goods such as vaccines. Global coordination is vital for transferring health supplies and expertise where they are most needed in the near term, and to develop a coordinated exit strategy from restrictions on the free movement of people in the medium term. Moreover, the unprecedented common economic shock adds to the growing evidence of the gains from coordinating monetary and fiscal actions across countries (Bodenstein, Corsetti, and Guerrieri 2020; Triggs 2018). In late March, the G7 pledged to “do whatever is necessary to restore confidence and economic growth and to protect jobs, businesses, and the resilience of the financial system” (U.S. Department of the Treasury 2020).` - [link](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/33748/211553-Ch01.pdf?sequence=18&isAllowed=y) - Global Economic Prospects, 2020
    
- A 2001 Paper found that:
    
    - Output volatility has enormously fallen in the US and other high-income countries (G7) (minus Japan). They also found that higher inflation and higher inflation volatility both predict higher output volatility -- but the time trend predicts lower volatility `We have documented the long and large decline in output volatility over the last half-century.` - [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1353/eca.2001.0013) - The Long and Large Decline in U.S. Output Volatility, Blanchard and Simon, 2001
    
- A 2018 Paper found that there was no evidence for the post-2008 era having seen increased volatility.
    
    - `In this paper, we focused on break detection in mean and in variance on output growth for a set of advanced countries, based on statistical test procedures. It turns out that the Great Recession period is characterized by large breaks in mean of transitory nature, while dates of breaks in variance are consistent with the Great Moderation period in the eighties. This leads us to conclude that there is no evidence favoring an end of the low output volatility period, but rather that the Great Recession has a dramatically short-lived effect on the output growth but not on its volatility.` - [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1111/ecin.12551) - Does The Great Recession Imply The End Of The Great Moderation? International Evidence, Charles et al., 2018
    
- Good monetary policy is the claim to low volatility of capital in the US, namely The Great Moderation.
    
    - `The Great Moderation is the name given to the period of decreased macroeconomic volatility experienced in the United States from the mid-1980s to the financial crisis in 2007.` `The Great Moderation is seen as a part of the monetary policy framework laid by Paul Volcker and continued by Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke during their time as Federal Reserve chairs.` - [link](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/great-moderation.asp#:~:text=The%20Great%20Moderation%20is%20the,States%20starting%20in%20the%201980s.&text=The%20Great%20Moderation%20can%20be,inflation%20and%20positive%20economic%20growth.)

## Worker Co-Operatives
- Worker Co-operatives are used as an alternative firm structure that is totally owned and run by the workers of that firm.
- Mondragón - Mondragón is used as a common example of a worker co-operative that is successful in spain making the model stand strong against traditional firms but there's one problem, It’s worker-owned, it’s not totally worker managed making Mondragón by definition not a worker co-operative.
    
    - `Take the most advanced case: Mondragon. It’s worker-owned, it’s not worker managed, although the management does come from the workforce often, but it’s in a market system and they still exploit workers in South America, and they do things that are harmful to the society as a whole and they have no choice. If you’re in a system where you must make a profit in order to survive, you're compelled to ignore negative externalities, effects on others.` - Chomsky. [link](https://www.counterpunch.org/2012/04/30/talking-with-chomsky/)
    
- Mondragón has also become more traditional over time.
    
    - `Mondragón was set up with the ideals of worker participation, solidarity and equality, but as the business has grown bigger and bigger, and become more and more integrated into global capitalism, its founding principles have applied only to a shrinking percentage of its workforce. In 1993, Britain’s Guardian newspaper reported that Mondragón was restructuring to get ready to compete in the European single market. It noted that “increased salary differentials, advertising campaigns in Fortune and cooperative alliances with companies like Hotpoint have had many co–op workers wondering whether in the new Mondragón Cooperative Corporation [MCC] some members are more equal than others.”` - [link](https://isreview.org/issue/93/are-workers-cooperatives-alternative-capitalism)
    
- The problem with a partially or totally worker managed but not worker owned firm is that if you were to allow outside private investors, workers have a conflict of interest compared to shareholders, that conflict being labor cost and profit, as labor is a cost of business and affects the profit delivered to shareholders.
    
    - `The board of directors of a public company has a fiduciary responsibility for executive pay levels and programs. Accordingly, public companies have independent compensation committees to oversee executive pay decisions.` - [link](https://www.pwc.com/hu/hu/szolgaltatasok/konyvvizsgalat/szamviteli-tanacsadas/kiadvanyok/roadmap_for_an_ipo.pdf) - Roadmap for an IPO: A guide to going public, PwC, 2017
    
    - `The Commission may promulgate rules to provide that the standard of conduct for all brokers, dealers, and investment advisers, when providing personalized investment advice about securities to retail customers (and such other customers as the Commission may by rule provide), shall be to act in the best interest of the customer without regard to the financial or other interest of the broker, dealer, or investment adviser providing the advice.` - [link](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/COMPS-1878/pdf/COMPS-1878.pdf) - Investment Advisers Act Of 1940
    
- Workers that manage could vote to use that investment to bolster their own personal income, necessarily decreasing profits and then not delivering on that fiduciary responsibility that is required under federal agencies such as the SEC that firms have to deliver capital gains to its shareholders when the firm makes profit.
    
    - `Strict care must be taken to ensure no conflict of interest arises between the fiduciary and their principal.` In the case of a firm, the fiduciary being a CEO and the principal being the board of directors and in the case of a worker co-operative, the board of directors is the workers who manage. [link](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiduciary.asp)
    
    - `In accordance with such rules, any material conflicts of interest shall be disclosed and may be consented to by the customer.` - [link](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/COMPS-1878/pdf/COMPS-1878.pdf) - Investment Advisers Act Of 1940
    
- Also, if the federal agency has jurisdiction over the firm, then they are not entirely managed by workers. If there is no SEC-type agency, then there is no fiduciary responsibility. If there is no fiduciary responsibility, then there is no reason to invest. If there's no reason to invest, there's no company expansion.
- Marx argued that socialism in one country is impossible because a socialist revolution that does not spread will either be crushed from the outside or survive by being transformed from within. Socialism in one workplace is even more of a non-starter, because the economic, political, and military power of the existing ruling class remains in place.
    
    - `At the same time the experience of the period from 1848 to 1864 has proved beyond doubt that, however excellent in principle and however useful in practice, co-operative labor, if kept within the narrow circle of the casual efforts of private workmen, will never be able to arrest the growth in geometrical progression of monopoly, to free the masses, nor even to perceptibly lighten the burden of their miseries.` - [link](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1864/10/27.htm) - Inaugural Address of the International Working Men’s Association, Marx, 1864
    
- Because co-operative by themselves do not challenge the system and may divert energy away from doing so, Marx noted that a variety of establishment figures had become supporters of co-operative.
    
    - `It is perhaps for this very reason that plausible noblemen, philanthropic middle-class spouters, and even kept political economists have all at once turned nauseously complimentary to the very co-operative labor system they had vainly tried to nip in the bud by deriding it as the utopia of the dreamer, or stigmatizing it as the sacrilege of the socialist.` - [link](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1864/10/27.htm) - Inaugural Address of the International Working Men’s Association, Marx, 1864

## Labor Theory Of Value
- The Labor Theory of Value claims that Goods + Labor Inputs + Surplus Value = Value of the Commodity
- The Labor Theory of Value is defined by four different elements:
    - Abstract Labour: economically valuable work time
    - Concrete Labour: particular activity that has a specific useful effect.
    - Use Value: a commodities capacity to satisfy a human need.
    - Exchange Value: determines ratio which a commodity is exchangeable with every other commodity.
- Marx asserts that LTV only applies to the averages of various goods, not individual goods making this a self-admitted incomplete theory of value:
    
    - `But without the leave, and behind the back, of our weaver, the old-fashioned mode of weaving undergoes a change. The labour-time that yesterday was without doubt socially necessary to the production of a yard of linen, ceases to be so to-day, a fact which the owner of the money is only too eager to prove from the prices quoted by our friend s competitors. Unluckily for him, weavers are not few and far between. Lastly, suppose that every piece of linen in the market contains no more labour-time than is socially necessary. In spite of this, all these pieces taken as a whole, may have had superfluous labour-time spent upon them. If the market cannot stomach the whole quantity at the normal price of 2 shillings a yard, this proves that too great a portion of the total labour of the community has been expended in the form of weaving. The effect is the same as if each individual weaver had expended more labour-time upon his particular product than is socially necessary. Here we may say, with the German proverb: caught together, hung together. All the linen in the market counts but as one article of commerce, of which each piece is only an aliquot part. And as a matter of fact, the value also of each single yard is but the materialised form of the same definite and socially fixed quantity of homogeneous human labour.` - [link](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch03.htm) - Capital: a critique of political economy. Vol. 1, Marx, 1867
    
- In a journal called `Marxian Economics: A Reappraisal Essays On Volume III Of Capital - Volume 2: Profits, Prices And Dynamics`, In a section called `The Empirical Strength of the Labour Theory of Value`, Anwar Shaikh argues that the theory holds as proved by showing that total labor total times vs price of production correlates to each other. [link](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafykbzaceaccp5bzqpxfaxysdgcgzbgeau6k75iwtvq64qczstpu74i7lobsc?filename=%5B%5D+Riccardo+Bellofiore+%28eds.%29+-+Marxian+Economics%3A+A+Reappraisal%3A+Volume+2%3A+Essays+on+Volume+III+of+Capital+Profit%2C+Prices+and+Dynamics+%281998%2C+Palgrave+Macmillan%29+%5B10.1007%2F978-1-349-26121-5%5D.pdf) - Marxian Economics: A Reappraisal: Volume 2: Essays On Volume Iii Of Capital, Profits, Prices And Dynamics, Bellofiore, 1998
- Andrew Kliman argues that the problem with Shaikh's claim is that because `price of production` is represented through the input-output of an entire sector of an economy, it misses the value of a single product from said sector and doesn't factor the size of a given sector. So Kiman replicates the data:
    
    - `The measures of distance indicate that prices differed from adjusted values by an average of about +/-8% to +/-13%. Such results, and even somewhat weaker ones, are typically taken as providing strong confirmation that values are close to market prices. Yet what can we infer from this closeness and what can we not validly infer?` - [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1093/cje/26.3.299) - The law of value and laws of statistics: sectoral values and prices in the US economy, 1977—97, Kliman, 2002
    
- Kliman then adjusts the price and value of each sector by its aggregate labour and non-labour costs.
    
    - `I have chosen to deflate the sectoral aggregate prices and values by aggregate labour and non labour costs.` - [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1093/cje/26.3.299) - The law of value and laws of statistics: sectoral values and prices in the US economy, 1977–97
    
- Kliman then finds after adjustment, no correlation between labor input and value occurs
    
    - `Once the effects of industry size are removed, it is not the case that prices are high in high-value sectors and low in low-value sectors. Rather, size-adjusted prices and values are close only in the sense that almost all sectors prices are close to almost all sectors values. I thus find that, on average, a sector s value is no better a predictor of its price than is a random variable with the same probability distribution as the values.` - [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1093/cje/26.3.299) - The law of value and laws of statistics: sectoral values and prices in the US economy, 1977–97
    
- In their book `Capital is Power`, Jonathan Nitzan & Shimshon Bichler argue that Labor Theory of Value researchers assume wages equal the value of labor power (among other assumptions), which results in circular reasoning,
    
    - `The most important of these assumptions are that the value of labour power is proportionate to the actual wage rate, that the ratio of variable capital to surplus value is given by the price ratio of wages to profit, and occasionally also that the value of the depreciated constant capital is equal to a fraction of the capital’s money price. In other words, the researcher assumes precisely what the labour theory of value is supposed to demonstrate.` - [link](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/bafykbzacedvvf6kzqa35zvfvyix6otsy2yy53llgmxiukm5lzsqmpkfouzvbc?filename=Jonathan%20Nitzan%2C%20Shimshon%20Bichler%20-%20Capital%20as%20Power_%20A%20Study%20of%20Order%20and%20Creorder%20%28Ripe%20Series%20in%20Global%20Political%20Economy%29%20%282009%29.pdf) Capital as power: a study of order and creorder, Nitzan and Bichler, 2009
    
- Nitzan And Bichler then try to present an example demonstrating that, even when price and value are totally uncorrelated, aggregate price and value will be strongly correlated, demonstrating that this correlation is spurious.
    
    - `the average error you get when predicting United States prices using the labour theory of value is only about 9%. This has proven to be the case across many industries and several decades.` - [link](http://bnarchives.yorku.ca/308/2/20101200_cockshott_nitzan_bichler_testing_the_ltv_exchange_web.htm)
    
## Modern Monetary Theory
- MMT doesn't have a testable, falsifiable hypothesis that we can compare to neoclassical economics.
    
    - `ME/MMT is distinguished by its explicit recognition that the currency itself is a public monopoly, which is the micro foundation of fiat currency. MEMMT then builds the ramifications of that fundamental understanding.` - [link](http://www00.unibg.it/dati/corsi/910003/64338-Warren%20Mosler%20Bergamo%20paper%20March%2010.pdf)
    
- MMT claims that currency is a tax credit but doesn't explain the format of that tax credit, unlike conventional tax credits which are in dollars, which would make tax credits - currency - tax credits which is circular.
    
    - `ME/MMT recognizes that with fiat currency, the funds the government spends are best thought of as tax credits. Likewise, the funds the government spends that are not immediately used to pay taxes remain in the economy as ‘monetary savings’ until used to pay taxes in the future. Furthermore, these tax credits outstanding constitute what is called the ‘national debt’.` - [link](http://www00.unibg.it/dati/corsi/910003/64338-Warren%20Mosler%20Bergamo%20paper%20March%2010.pdf)
    
- MMT has also been explained by its founder very similarly to what the U.S. Federal Reserve already does, making it a subject within Keynesian Economics.
    
    - `MEMMT presumes the role of government is to establish and sustain public infrastructure for public purpose, and that the currency is a tool of government for the promotion of public purpose. Accordingly, what MEMMT offers are fiscal and monetary proposals that sustain employment opportunities for anyone willing and able to work, and that optimize real terms of trade, all in support of real standards of living.` - [link](http://www00.unibg.it/dati/corsi/910003/64338-Warren%20Mosler%20Bergamo%20paper%20March%2010.pdf)
    
- An IGM survey of a panel of 26 economists found that 0% agree with MMT in any degree of agreement. [link](https://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/modern-monetary-theory/)
- MMT has been tried in various Latin American countries and caused runaway inflation, huge currency devaluations, and precipitous real wage declines.
    
    - `Almost every one of the Latin American experiments with major central bank–financed fiscal expansions took place under populist regimes, and all of them ended up badly, with runaway inflation, huge currency devaluations, and precipitous real wage declines. In most of these episodes — Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Peru, and Venezuela — policymakers used arguments similar to those made by MMTers to justify extensive use of money creation to finance very large increases in public expenditures.` - [link](https://www.cato.org/cato-journal/fall-2019/modern-monetary-theory-cautionary-tales-latin-america)
    
- In a PBS interview with Paul Krugman on Modern Monetary Theory, he is asked about the claim of `The Government Cannot Go Bankrupt` made by MMTers and replies,
    
    - `Yeah, this is basically true, but you don't need a new theory for that, we kinda knew that already. To a large extent, they're just doing Keynesian Economics, but they don't know they're doing Keynesian Economics and they've invented their own terminology for it.` - [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gyj1H-gjI8)

### Notes
- Elinor Ostrom’s work on common pool resources show thoroughly that bottom-up approaches of consensus and agreement are what allow such approaches to work. While not explicitly socialist, her work does show people overcoming the tragedy of the commons (which is a common argument against socialism) for a long time, sometimes _hundreds_ of years.
- USSR was playing catch-up utilizing technology developed under capitalism. Growth rates tapered off as its industry matured. Failed to develop an internet because of infighting.
- Censorship of science under the USSR: most obvious fields that were suppressed were genetics, cybernetics and physics. USSR also censored photocopier which made communication difficult because they feared uprising
- Stafford Beer’s Cybersyn was built using cybernetic principles and rejected centralized planning so the system could be more adaptive
- 20th century `communist` regimes all failed miserably and at best, were little better than colonial capitalism. In their wake they left deeply reactionary societies and their ruling elites flipped to fascists almost overnight
- Nation-states’ military doctrines, often based on vertical command structure, are slow to respond to decentralised warfare by non-state actors
## Unemployment benefits
### US Unemployment Insurance
- A 2017 paper found that `This paper has taken advantage of a discontinuity in the Austrian UI system and identified a positive UI effect on re-employment wages. We argue that the magnitude of this UI wage effect is economically meaningful from both an individual and a social perspective. The magnitude of the effect is consistent with rational behavior of an agent who extends her unemployment by being more selective in her job search, knowing that this can help secure a lasting wage gain upon reemployment. Moreover, from a social perspective, the UI wage effect implies a considerable positive fiscal externality.` - [link](https://sci-hub.ee/10.1257/aer.20150528)
- A 2020 paper found that `We use LEHD data and find that match quality explains 35% of the increased wages due to more generous UI, while employer quality can explain almost 50% of the wage increase from UI. By contrast, we find that sorting is not much affected by more generous UI benefits. Consistent with both improved matches and employer quality, we find that extended UI benefit duration increases the likelihood of remaining in the job one year later, thus increasing job stability. In total, the increase in wages and the increase in job stability would imply an increase in earnings of $4,593 due to the increased generosity in UI benefit duration.` - [link](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w27574/w27574.pdf)
### UK Universal Credit & Jobseekers Allowance

### European Union
- A 2011 paper found that `While the OLS analysis revealed the presence of a moderate correlation between social welfare spending and immigration from non-EU origins, the IV and GMM estimates indicate that the causal effect is smaller and statistically insignificant, thereby rejecting the welfare magnet hypothesis. All estimates for EU immigrants are essentially zero, which suggests that immigration within the EU does not respond to unemployment benefit incentives.` - [link](https://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&context=lew2012)
# Immigration Policy
## Trump's Wall
- A 2019 report found that:
    
    - `The number of Mexican immigrants living in the U.S. illegally has declined by 2 million since 2007. In 2017, 4.9 million unauthorized immigrants from Mexico lived in the U.S., down from a peak of 6.9 million in 2007. Mexicans now make up fewer than half of the nation’s 10.5 million unauthorized immigrants (47% in 2017).` - [link](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/06/28/what-we-know-about-illegal-immigration-from-mexico/) - What we know about illegal immigration from Mexico, Pew Research Center and Krogstad, 2019

## More Open Immigration
- A 2014 Cato institute paper asserts that most studies state the fiscal impact of immigration being negligible, and cites many ways that immigrants have had positive impacts on the economy, and predicts that future immigration should have no dramatic fiscal impact. [link](https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/working-paper-21-fix.pdf) - The Fiscal Impact of Immigration, Nowrasteh, 2014
- A 2017 report by the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine asserts `Immigration's Long-Term Impacts on Overall Wages and Employment of Native-Born U.S. Workers Very Small, Although Low-Skilled Workers May Be Affected, New Report Finds; Impacts on Economic Growth Positive, While Effects on Government Budgets Mixed.` `When measured over a period of 10 years or more, the impact of immigration on the wages of native-born workers overall is very small.` `Immigration has an overall positive impact on long-run economic growth in the U.S.` - [link](https://www.nationalacademies.org/news/2016/09/new-report-assesses-the-economic-and-fiscal-consequences-of-immigration)
- Even illegal immigrants put into the system in unexpected ways, `Stephen Goss, the chief actuary of the Social Security Administration (SSA), told VICE News that an estimated 7 million people are currently working in the US illegally. Of those, he estimates that about 3.1 million are using fake or expired social security numbers, yet also paying automatic payroll taxes. Goss believes that these workers pay an annual net contribution of $12 billion to the Social Security Trust Fund.` - [link](https://news.vice.com/article/unauthorized-immigrants-paid-100-billion-into-social-security-over-last-decade)

## Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals
- A 2016 study in the Journal of Public Economics found that DACA increased labor force participation and decreased the unemployment rate for DACA-eligible immigrants. DACA also increased the income of undocumented immigrants in the bottom of the income distribution. The study estimates that DACA moved 50,000 to 75,000 unauthorized immigrants into employment. [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1016/j.jpubeco.2016.08.014) - The Effects of DACAmentation: The Impact of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals on Unauthorized Immigrants, Pope, 2016
- According to University of California, Davis economist Giovanni Peri, DACA consequently:
    
    - `increases consumption and overall demand for U.S. services, products, and jobs where the DACA recipients live and spend. Economists have shown that highly skilled workers increase local productivity and create opportunities for the other workers too`. [link](http://econofact.org/the-economic-cost-of-repealing-daca)
    
- A 2016 study in Economics Letters found that DACA-eligible households were 38% less likely than non-eligible unauthorized immigrant households to live in poverty.

- Peri argues that DACA recipients likely have a significant net positive fiscal impact given that DACA-eligible individuals have similar characteristics as second-generation immigrants, and that research shows that second-generation immigrants have a net positive fiscal impact of $173,000 to $259,000 per immigrant. Peri also notes that the U.S. public school system has already invested in educating these individuals, and they are at the point at which they can start contributing to the U.S. economy and public coffers; deporting them or increasing the likelihood that they are deported is economically counterproductive. [link](http://econofact.org/the-economic-cost-of-repealing-daca)

# Environmental Policy
## Climate Change
- In 2001 Following the publication of the IPCC Third Assessment Report, seventeen national science academies issued a joint statement, entitled `The Science of Climate Change`, explicitly acknowledging the IPCC position as representing the scientific consensus on climate change science. [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1126/science.292.5520.1261) - The Science of Climate Change, Science Mag, 2001
- In 2007 In preparation for the 33rd G8 summit, the Network of African Science Academies submitted a joint `statement on sustainability, energy efficiency, and climate change`: A consensus, based on current evidence, now exists within the global scientific community that human activities are the main source of climate change and that the burning of fossil fuels is largely responsible for driving this change. The IPCC should be congratulated for the contribution it has made to public understanding of the nexus that exists between energy, climate and sustainability. [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20231102014012/http://nasaconline.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Joint-Statement-by-NASAC-to-G8-on-Sustainability-Energy-efficiency-and-Cli.pdf) - Joint statement by the Network of African Science Academies (NASAC) to the G8 on sustainability, energy efficiency and climate change, Network of African Science Academies - 2007
- In 2009 In advance of the UNFCCC negotiations to be held in Copenhagen in December 2009, the national science academies of the G8+5 nations issued a joint statement declaring, `Climate change and sustainable energy supply are crucial challenges for the future of humanity. It is essential that world leaders agree on the emission reductions needed to combat negative consequences of anthropogenic climate change`. The statement references the IPCC's Fourth Assessment of 2007, and asserts that `climate change is happening even faster than previously estimated; global CO2 emissions since 2000 have been higher than even the highest predictions, Arctic sea ice has been melting at rates much faster than predicted, and the rise in the sea level has become more rapid`. The thirteen signatories were the same national science academies that issued the 2007 and 2008 joint statements.

## Fossil Fuels
- [EESI - Coleman and Dietz 19](https://www.eesi.org/papers/view/fact-sheet-fossil-fuel-subsidies-a-closer-look-at-tax-breaks-and-societal-costs#targetText=According%20to%20the%20IMF%2C%20%22fossil,by%203.8%20percent%20of%20GDP.%22)
- AIR AND LAND DESTRUCTION FROM FOSSIL FUELS
- Burning fossil fuels creates **air pollutants** such as:
    - particulate matter
    - carbon monoxide
    - sulfur dioxide
    - ozone
    - mercury
        - _(note: Coal-fired power plants are also the largest source of airborne mercury emissions in the United States. Mercury can move through the food chain and accumulate in the flesh of fish, posing the greatest risk to pregnant women)_
- These pollutants lead to **health impacts** including:
    - Asthma
    - lung disease
    - Bronchitis
    - and other chronic respiratory diseases that may lead to premature death
- Air pollutants from fossil fuels also contribute to:
    - the development of **lung cancers** as well as other cancers (30 percent of cancer-related deaths each year)
    - 200,000 **premature deaths** each year
- Fine particulate matter from U.S. coal plants (in 2010) resulted in:
    - 13,200 deaths
    - 9,700 hospitalizations
    - 20,000 **heart attacks**
- Extraction and refining of fossil fuel may result in a host of negative outcomes including:
    - landscape degradation
    - risk for spills
- **Coal extraction and burning involves**
    - **Strip mining** **(65% of production**
        - **(note: Involves clearing vegetation, soil, and rock above coal deposits, leading to permanent damage of landscapes and the creation of massive amounts of mine wastes)**
    - pollution across the supply chain
    - **coal ash deposits**
        - a combustion byproduct containing toxic heavy metals like arsenic, mercury, and chromium
        - one of the largest sources of industrial waste in the United States
        - 95 percent of coal ash storage sites have **contaminated groundwater** at levels deemed unsafe by the EPA
        - In the flooding that followed Hurricane Florence, several coal ash storage sites in North Carolina overflowed or were damaged, spilling contaminated water into surrounding area
## Nuclear Power
- [Kharecha and Hansen 13](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es3051197?source=cen)
- Global nuclear power has prevented:
    - **1.84 million deaths** related to air pollution
    - **64 gigatonnes of CO2 emissions** that would have resulted from fossil fuel burning
- On the basis of global projection data that take into account the effects of the Fukushima accident, nuclear power could, by midcentury, additionally prevent:
    - an average of **4.2 hundred thousand to 7.04 million deaths**
    - **80 to 240 gigatonnes CO2 emissions** due to fossil fuels

    - Nuclear energy now provides about **10% of the world's electricity** from about **450 power reactors**.
    - Over **50 countries** utilise nuclear energy in about 225 research reactors.
    - These reactors are used for the production of medical and industrial isotopes, as well as for training.

## Renewables
- [Stanford: Jacobson et al. 2015](http://web.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/CombiningRenew/CONUSGridIntegration.pdf) ([cited](https://www.ewg.org/energy/22422/100-percent-renewable-energy-us-possible-yes-0))
- **100 percent wind and solar power** could provide electricity to the continental U.S. more reliably than the current system by 2050, and at lower projected costs
    - This is in conjunction with energy efficiency, energy storage and other advances to complement renewables
- [Brown et al. 18](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032118303307) ([cited](https://www.ewg.org/energy/22422/100-percent-renewable-energy-us-possible-yes-0))
    - Analysis of a number of studies from around the world on the feasibility of 100% renewables.
    - In brief, the study includes explanations that:
        - There’s more than enough solar, wind and hydro potential – **30 times more** than business-as-usual forecasts for energy demand in 2050.
        - Technology already exists to **account for the variability** of wind and solar generation, so that the lights will stay on even when the weather doesn’t cooperate.
        - We do not need to alter the design of the electric grid radically to accommodate 100 percent renewables: The shift is well underway and accelerating.
        - **Costs won’t be overwhelming**. A grid based on 100 percent renewables can compete in cost with fossil fuel systems, even before factoring in the tremendous costs of pollution, global warming and water usage.
        - A number of nations and regions are at or close to 100 percent renewables already, including Denmark, Norway and parts of Germany. Canada is at 62 percent renewables and Brazil at 76 percent.
## Carbon Tax/Dividend
- A 2013 study found that:
    
    - `during the first 20 years alone, a CF&D policy would lead to: A 50% reduction of carbon emissions below 1990 levels, The addition of 2.8 million jobs above baseline, driven by the steady economic stimulus of the energy dividend, The avoidance of 230,000 premature deaths due to reduction in air pollutants that often accompany carbon emissions` - [link](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/remi-report/)
    
- A 2017 paper found that:
    
    - `in response to the BC carbon tax, employment declines in emission-intensive and trade-exposed industries while employment rises in clean service industries. The employment impacts differ across industries due to the difference in the output effect and redistribution effect of the tax. Employment falls in industries whose negative output effect outweighs their positive redistribution effect.` `The results from the preferred specification suggests that the BC carbon tax generated, on average, a small but statistically significant 0.74 percent (roughly 10,000 jobs) annual increases in employment over the 2007-2013 period, a 4.5 percent increase overall.` - [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1016/j.jeem.2017.03.003) - Jobs and climate policy: Evidence from British Columbia's revenue-neutral carbon tax, Yamazaki, 2017
    
- A 2018 paper found that:
    
    - `under plausible assumptions, the lowest household income quintile does not suffer an absolute reduction in welfare under the carbon tax. We also find larger source- and use-side impacts than what the narrower welfare measures used in previous studies would predict.` - [link](https://media.rff.org/documents/RFF20WP2018-22dc.pdf) - Impacts of a Carbon Tax across US Household Income Groups: What Are the Equity-Efficiency Trade-Offs?, Resources for the Future, 2018

## EPA
- EPA - A 2017 study found that the Clean Air Act of 1970 led to an over 10 percent reduction in pollution (`ambient TSP levels`) in counties that exceeded the pollution thresholds set by the Act in the three years after the regulation went into effect. The study found that this regulation-induced reduction in air pollution has caused affected workers to work more and earned one percent more in annual earnings. The authors estimate that cumulative lifetime income gain for each affected individual is approximately $4,300 in present value terms. [link](https://sci-hub.ee/10.1086/691465)
- A 2018 study found that the Clean Air Act contributed to the 60% decline in pollution emissions by the manufacturing industry between 1990 and 2008. [link](https://sci-hub.ee/10.1257/aer.20151272)

## Public Transport
- [link](https://www.vox.com/2021/3/10/22303355/gen-z-high-speed-rail-biden-map-meme-buttigieg)
- A 2012 paper found that
    
    - `The nine papers identified in this review report a range of 8–33 minutes of additional physical activity associated with public transport use, with several papers reporting 12–15 minutes. Using bootstrapping analyses, we found that if public transport use by inactive adults was to increase, there would be a significant dose-response increase in the population level of sufficiently active adults in NSW.` - [link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3407915/)
    
- A 2019 paper found that
    
    - `This systematic review found that initiating public transportation use was associated with modestly lower adiposity. Little evidence was available for other outcomes. Incorporating public transportation into sustainable urban design should be considered a potential mechanism for reducing overweight and obesity in the general population.` - [link](https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/188/4/785/5301286)
    
- A 2020 paper found that
    
    - `In this study, we find more positive than negative findings when excluding the null findings regarding the association between access to public transport and childhood obesity.` - [link](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/obr.12987)
