### Medicare for All
#### Economic Analysis of Medicare for All, Pollin et al., 2018
- A 2018 paper by The Political Economy Research Institute identifies that in 2017 the US was spending $3.24 trillion on personal healthcare but other high income countries spend around 40% less and produce better healthcare outcomes. Medicare for all would reduce healthcare spending by nearly 10% to $2.93 trillion and create `stable access to good care for all US residents.`
- The study gives a good explanation regarding what medicare for all is and the goals:
	- `The primary goal of Medicare for All is to provide high-quality health care to all U.S. residents. This includes full coverage for the 8.8 percent of the population that is presently uninsured and the 26 percent of the population that is underinsured. Medicare for All also aims to provide stable access to decent coverage to all U.S. residents, including those who currently receive adequate care but may face difficulties at later points.` - [Economic Analysis of Medicare for All, Pollin et al., 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20230423162841/https://peri.umass.edu/publication/item/download/805_a3e545f40523864e46158aca8ebbb158)
    - `our results show that Medicare for All can promote both lower costs and greater equity in the financing of health care in the United States.` - [Economic Analysis of Medicare for All, Pollin et al., 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20230423162841/https://peri.umass.edu/publication/item/download/805_a3e545f40523864e46158aca8ebbb158)
- Among the main findings of the study are that other countries which have implemented some kind of universal healthcare generate better outcomes than the current system in the US.
    - `It is also the case that, on balance, other countries that provide universal health care generate superior health outcomes relative to the U.S. Another 2017 study summarizes some key evidence as follows: 'In other countries, a shift to universal health care has been associated with reduced mortality. Specifically, 34 countries score higher than the USA on the Health Access and Quality Index, a metric based on amenable mortality, or death that could be averted with medical care. All of these countries provide a form of universal care.'` - [Economic Analysis of Medicare for All, Pollin et al., 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20230423162841/https://peri.umass.edu/publication/item/download/805_a3e545f40523864e46158aca8ebbb158)
- In regard to the cost saving potential under medicare for all, the study identifies that:
	- `through implementation of Medicare for All, overall costs of providing full health care coverage to all U.S. residents could fall by about 19 percent in the first year of full operations relative to spending levels under the existing system.` - [Economic Analysis of Medicare for All, Pollin et al., 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20230423162841/https://peri.umass.edu/publication/item/download/805_a3e545f40523864e46158aca8ebbb158)
- The breakdown of the savings is as follows: 
	- `1) administration (9.0 percent savings in total system costs); 2) pharmaceutical pricing (5.9 percent savings in system costs); and 3) establishing uniform Medicare rates for hospitals, physicians, and clinics (2.8 percent savings in system costs).` - [Economic Analysis of Medicare for All, Pollin et al., 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20230423162841/https://peri.umass.edu/publication/item/download/805_a3e545f40523864e46158aca8ebbb158)
- This totals up to 17.7% savings and the other savings which would make this total add up to the aforementioned 19% would be achieved by addressing: 
	- `1) unnecessary services; 2) inefficiently delivered services; 3) missed prevention opportunities; and 4) fraud,` - [Economic Analysis of Medicare for All, Pollin et al., 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20230423162841/https://peri.umass.edu/publication/item/download/805_a3e545f40523864e46158aca8ebbb158)
- The study identifies two sources which could/would be sourced to finance medicare for all: current revenue sources and a multitude of other sources. Current revenue sources account for $1.88 trillion, meaning the extra ~$1.05 trillion (the study assumes $1.08 trillion for the purposes of analysis) would need to come from other sources the study identifies like cutting business healthcare premiums by 8% relative to existing spending per worker, a 3.75% sales tax on non-necessities, a net worth tax of 0.38%, and taxing long-term capital gains as ordinary income (see page 9 of the study for more in-depth analysis).
    - `The first is the same public health care revenue sources that presently provide about 60 percent of all U.S. health care financing. These include Medicare and Medicaid, which together finance nearly 40 percent of all health care funding. It also includes tax subsidies for health care expenditures by individuals and households, which equal about 10 percent of total funding.` - [Economic Analysis of Medicare for All, Pollin et al., 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20230423162841/https://peri.umass.edu/publication/item/download/805_a3e545f40523864e46158aca8ebbb158)
    - `There are multiple ways through which the U.S. federal government could raise $1.08 trillion in additional revenues to finance Medicare for All. We examine here one set of new measures that would be capable of generating a total of $1.08 trillion in an equitable and efficient matter. But we emphasize that additional approaches could also be workable.` - [Economic Analysis of Medicare for All, Pollin et al., 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20230423162841/https://peri.umass.edu/publication/item/download/805_a3e545f40523864e46158aca8ebbb158)
- When looking at the impact on families, low and middle income families would see their healthcare spending reduced by anywhere from 0.8% to 14% (Figure 2).
- On a macroeconomics level, the study reports that, over a 10 year period in which healthcare is 15.8% of America's GDP (as opposed to 17.2% as it is now), implementing medicare for all would raise productivity thanks to improved health outcomes, support greater income equality, and support job creation (see page 16 of the study for further analysis).
#### Does Medicare Coverage Improve Cancer Detection and Mortality Outcomes?, Myerson et al., 2020
- A 2020 paper in The Journal of Policy Analysis and Management found that:
    - `We reviewed 90 studies and included primary analyses of 22 single-payer plans from 18 studies, published between 1991 and 2018, including 8 national and 14 state-level plans` - [Does Medicare Coverage Improve Cancer Detection and Mortality Outcomes?, Myerson et al., 2020](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/pam.22199)
- the authors of this research concluded that:
    - `We found that 19 (86%) of the analyses predicted net savings (median net result was a savings of 3.46% of total costs) in the first year of program operation and 20 (91%) predicted savings over several years; anticipated growth rates would result in long-term net savings for all plans.` - [Does Medicare Coverage Improve Cancer Detection and Mortality Outcomes?, Myerson et al., 2020](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/pam.22199)
    - `All studies estimate lower costs due to simplified payment administration, but vary in the size of these savings` `In the long term, projected net savings increase, due to a more tightly controlled rate of growth.` - [Does Medicare Coverage Improve Cancer Detection and Mortality Outcomes?, Myerson et al., 2020](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/pam.22199)
- The study reviewed 22 different, credible, economic models of single-payer financing in the US and found that:
    - `19 (86%) predict net savings in the first year of operations, with a range from 7% higher net cost to 15% lower net cost.` - [Does Medicare Coverage Improve Cancer Detection and Mortality Outcomes?, Myerson et al., 2020](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/pam.22199)
    - `The largest net savings were for plans with reductions in drug costs. Net savings accumulate over time at an estimated 1.4% per year.` - [Does Medicare Coverage Improve Cancer Detection and Mortality Outcomes?, Myerson et al., 2020](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/pam.22199)
- Overall:
    - `These analyses suggest that single-payer can save money, even in year 1, incorporating a wide range of assumptions about potential savings.` - [Does Medicare Coverage Improve Cancer Detection and Mortality Outcomes?, Myerson et al., 2020](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/pam.22199)
- The research concludes:
    - `In this systematic review, we found a high degree of analytic consensus for the fiscal feasibility of a single-payer approach in the US.` - [Does Medicare Coverage Improve Cancer Detection and Mortality Outcomes?, Myerson et al., 2020](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/pam.22199)
    - `There is near-consensus in these analyses that single-payer would reduce health expenditures while providing high-quality insurance to all US residents. To achieve net savings, single-payer plans rely on simplified billing and negotiated drug price reductions, as well as global budgets to control spending growth over time. Replacing private insurers with a public system is expected to achieve lower net healthcare costs.` - [Does Medicare Coverage Improve Cancer Detection and Mortality Outcomes?, Myerson et al., 2020](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/pam.22199)
### Medicaid
- A 2017 Paper found that:
    - `..that the cohorts covered by Medicaid as young children in the 1960s and 1970s, grow up to be healthier adults who work more and receive public assistance less often.` `Improvements in longevity and morbidity are worth over one trillion dollars, and the labor supply and program participation effects save the government about $36 billion per year.` - [link](https://cdn.vanderbilt.edu/vu-my/wp-content/uploads/sites/2318/2019/04/14141045/medicaid_longrun_ajgb.pdf) - The Long-Run Effects of Childhood Insurance Coverage: Medicaid Implementation, Adult Health, and Labor Market Outcomes, Goodman-Bacon, 2017
### Affordable Care Act
- A 2015 report found that:
    - `most market fundamentals have stayed consistent with prior trends, suggesting that the implementation has not caused significant disruption for most market participants. Premiums for single and family coverage increased by 4% in 2015, continuing a fairly long period (2005 to 2015) where annual premium growth has averaged about 5%. The percentage of employers offering coverage (57%) is similar to recent years, as is the percentage of workers in offering firms covered by their own employer (63%).` - [link](https://files.kff.org/attachment/summary-of-findings-2015-employer-health-benefits-survey) - Employer Health Benefits 2015 Summary of Findings, The Kaiser Family Foundation and The Health Research & Educational Trust, 2015
- A 2016 report found that:
    - `In most parts of the country in 2016, a 40-year-old adult making $30,000 per year would pay about $208 per month for the second-lowest-silver plan. If this person is willing to switch to whatever the new second lowest-cost silver plan is in 2017, they will pay a similar amount (the after-tax credit payment for a similar person in 2017 is $207 per month or a change of 0%).` - [link](https://www.kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/2017-premium-changes-and-insurer-participation-in-the-affordable-care-acts-health-insurance-marketplaces/) - 2017 Premium Changes and Insurer Participation in the Affordable Care Act’s Health Insurance Marketplaces, The Kaiser Family Foundation, 2016
- A 2016 CDC report found that:
    - `an average of about 12 million people will be covered by insurance purchased through the (ACA) marketplaces.` `CBO and JCT expect average enrollment to continue to increase to 15 million people in 2017 and then to between 18 million and 19 million people each year from 2018 to 2026. Between 80 percent and 85 percent of those enrollees—or about 14 million to 16 million people—are expected to receive subsidies for purchasing that insurance each year after 2017.` - [link](https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/114th-congress-2015-2016/reports/51385-healthinsurancebaselineonecol.pdf) - Federal Subsidies for Health Insurance Coverage for People Under Age 65: 2016 to 2026, Congressional Budget Office, 2016
- A 2016 data sheet found that in 2013, the U.S. had 44.8 million people uninsured, In 2014, the U.S. had 36.0 million people uninsured, In 2015, the U.S. had 28.6 million people uninsured.

### Affordable Care Act Under Trump
- A 2017 paper found that:
    - `In its first two years of full implementation, the ACA improved health care access for Americans in low-income households, people who were not college graduates, and the unemployed. The law’s Medicaid expansion was responsible for about half of these gains. The ACA was associated with a substantial (but incomplete) narrowing of socioeconomic disparities in access, particularly in states that expanded Medicaid.` - [link](https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/pdf/10.1377/hlthaff.2017.0083) - The Affordable Care Act Reduced Socioeconomic Disparities In Health Care Access, Griffith et al., 2017
- A 2017 paper found that:
    - `In 2026, an estimated 52 million people would be uninsured, compared with 28 million who would lack insurance that year under current law.` `In 2018 and 2019, according to CBO and JCT’s estimates, average premiums for single policyholders in the nongroup market would be 15 percent to 20 percent higher than under current law, mainly because the individual mandate penalties would be eliminated, inducing fewer comparatively healthy people to sign up.` - [link](https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/115th-congress-2017-2018/costestimate/americanhealthcareact.pdf) - American Health Care Act, Congressional Budget Office, 2017
- A 2019 paper found that In 2016, the U.S. had 27.5 million people uninsured. In 2017, the U.S. had 28.3 million people uninsured. In 2018, the U.S. had 28.9 million people uninsured.

### Affordable Care Act Under Biden
## Universal Pre-K
- A 2017 paper found that:
    - `Like the TPS pre-K program, CAP’s Head Start program yields persistent gains in math and a reduction in grade retention. It is not associated with higher enrollment in honors courses, but it is associated with less chronic absenteeism.` - [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1002/pam.22023) - The Effects of Tulsa's Pre-K Program on Middle School Student Performance, Gormley et al., 2018
- A 2013 paper found that:
    - `For lower-SES children, we find evidence of increases in math scores that may be sustained through eighth grade. The increases may be working through multiple channels. First, children are likely to switch from not attending preschool to attending a high-quality public preschool when a universal program is introduced. Moreover, we find suggestive evidence that although they spend less time overall in the presence of their mothers, these children spend more time actively engaging in activities such as playing and reading with them. We also find suggestive evidence that their mothers are more likely to become employed.` - [link](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/2013b_cascio_preschool_education.pdf) - The Impacts of Expanding Access to High-Quality Preschool Education, Cascio and Schanzenbach, 2013
- A 2019 report found that:
    - `Of all Black and Latino 3- and 4-year-olds in the 26 states we analyzed, only 1% of Latino children and 4% of Black children were enrolled in high-quality state-funded preschool programs. Even among those who were enrolled in state-funded preschool programs, only 4% of Latino children and 13% of Black children in the 26 states we analyzed were enrolled in high-quality programs.` - [link](https://s3-us-east-2.amazonaws.com/edtrustmain/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/05162154/Young-Learners-Missed-Opportunities.pdf) - Young Learners, Missed Opportunities: Ensuring That Black and Latino Children Have Access to High-Quality State-Funded Preschool, The Education Trust, 2019
- A 2018 report found that:
    - `The two years of free, high-quality preschool that Washington, D.C., offers have resulted in the city boasting the highest maternal labor force participation rate in the nation. The District of Columbia’s universal preschool program has been good for significant numbers of women and their families, but it has also made the city an even more attractive place to live for those who can afford its high cost of living.` - [link](https://www.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/Children-Learning-Mothers-Earning-report.pdf) - The Effects of Universal Preschool in Washington, D.C., Malik, 2018
- A 2020 report found that:
    - `the positive budgetary impacts alone are greater than the costs—so that the programs pay for themselves. Specifically, the school facilities infrastructure investment returns $3.27 of output and $0.82 in tax revenues for each dollar invested in the program. The pre-K investment returns $3.08 in output and $1.61 in budgetary savings for each dollar spent on the program. And the K-12 public school investment yields $6.66 in output and $1.66 in tax revenue for each dollar expended.` - [link](https://equitablegrowth.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/102620-education-investment-report.pdf) - Public investments in education can spur equitable growth, pay for themselves, and create jobs for a stronger economic recovery, Lynch, 2020
## Socialised Housing
- There are two common models of Social Housing, the `Staircase Model` and the `Housing First Model`. The traditional Staircase Model requires people to obtain increasing levels of treatment and social integration (eg, get clean, get a job) before getting full-time housing. The Housing First Model in contrast works differently:
    - `The scheme, introduced in 2007, is called Housing First. It is built on the principle that having a permanent home can make solving health and social problems much easier. The homeless are given permanent housing on a normal lease. That can range from a self-contained apartment to a housing block with round-the-clock support. Tenants pay rent and are entitled to receive housing benefits. Depending on their income, they may contribute to the cost of the support services they receive. The rest is covered by local government.` - [link](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/02/how-finland-solved-homelessness/)
- A 2020 journal published by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development covered `How Finland Ended Homelessness` where it talks about Finland changing from the staircase model to the `Housing First Model` and their differences in results.
- They found that the staircase model halved homelessness in Finland but stalled in the 1990s,
    - `Using the staircase approach, Finland more than halved homelessness by 1994, but then progress slowed, as shown in exhibit 1. In particular, between 2004 and 2008, the number of single homeless individuals hovered between 7,400 and 7,960. Finland's annual homeless reports attributed the stalled progress to a group of people with high support needs who were experiencing long-term homelessness, analogous to chronic homelessness in the United States (Pleace, 2017). Researchers suggested that the staircase approach can work well with those who have opted for substance abuse rehabilitation and can cope with shared housing. However, the insistence on service users being intoxicant-free and able to take control of their lives has proven to be an insuperable barrier for many homeless people with multiple problems (Tainio and Fredriksson, 2009: 188).` - [link](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/periodicals/cityscpe/vol22num2/ch4.pdf) - A Multiple-City RCT of Housing First With Assertive Community Treatment for Homeless Canadians With Serious Mental Illness, Aubry et al., 2016
- They also found that starting in 2008, the `Housing First` model converted and purchased thousands of units of housing,
    - `A Housing First approach requires housing, and Finland set about converting shelters into apartment units and buying and constructing housing for Housing First. In 1985, Helsinki had 2,121 shelter and hostel beds, and by 2016, the number had shrunk to 52. Meanwhile, supported housing units in Helsinki grew from 127 to 1,309, and independent rental apartments for (formerly) homeless people increased from 65 to 2,433 (Y-Foundation, 2017: 30). The Y-Foundation is currently the fourth largest landlord in Finland.` - [link](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/periodicals/cityscpe/vol22num2/ch4.pdf) - A Multiple-City RCT of Housing First With Assertive Community Treatment for Homeless Canadians With Serious Mental Illness, Aubry et al., 2016
- They also found that residents often performed highly visible social work,
    - `Because programs that house a group of clients in the same building can encounter more community resistance than scattered-site apartments, the Finns have developed elaborate strategies to combat opposition from neighbors. Tenants engage in neighborhood work, such as collecting litter or maintaining parks. In one neighborhood, residents donned safety vests and kept watch over a bus stop used by schoolchildren. Neighbors have access to a 24-hour hotline to report any problems (Y-Foundation, 2017).` - [link](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/periodicals/cityscpe/vol22num2/ch4.pdf) - A Multiple-City RCT of Housing First With Assertive Community Treatment for Homeless Canadians With Serious Mental Illness, Aubry et al., 2016
  
- HUD-U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) Program was a U.S. implementation of the `Housing First Model`
- A 2014 paper found that:
    - `In conclusion, the results demonstrate the strong association between substance abuse and homelessness, particularly in veterans with comorbid alcohol and drug use disorders. Supported housing appears successful in housing veterans with substance use disorders, although additional efforts may be needed to address their substance abuse once they are housed.` - [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1016/j.addbeh.2013.02.002) - Alcohol and drug use disorders among homeless veterans: Prevalence and association with supported housing outcomes, Tsai et al., 2014
- A 2017 paper found that:
    - `Veterans who exited HUD-VASH generally did not return to homelessness within 600 days; approximately one in six of the veterans included in the study sample accessed a VHA homeless program within 600 days of exiting HUD-VASH.` - [link](https://www.va.gov/HOMELESS/nchav/docs/CusackMontgomery_ExaminingBidirectionalAssociationBetweenVeteranHomelessness.pdf) - Examining the bidirectional association between veteran homelessness and incarceration within the context of permanent supportive housing, Cusack and Montgomery, 2017
- A 2019 paper found that:
    - `For each additional voucher, permanent supportive housing units increased by 0.9 and the number of homeless veterans decreased by 1. Conclusions. Our results indicate the HUD-VASH program worked as intended and veterans’ homelessness would have risen substantially over the past decade without the program.` - [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.2105/ajph.2019.305231) - Housing and Urban Development–Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing Vouchers and Veterans’ Homelessness, 2007–2017, Evans et al., 2019
## Unions
- A 2003 paper found that:
    - `Unions raise wages of unionized workers by roughly 20% and raise compensation, including both wages and benefits, by about 28%, Unions reduce wage inequality because they raise wages more for low- and middle-wage workers than for higher-wage workers, more for blue-collar than for white-collar workers, and more for workers who do not have a college degree, Strong unions set a pay standard that nonunion employers follow. For example, a high school graduate whose workplace is not unionized but whose industry is 25% unionized is paid 5% more than similar workers in less unionized industries. The impact of unions on total nonunion wages is almost as large as the impact on total union wages. The most sweeping advantage for unionized workers is in fringe benefits. Unionized workers are more likely than their nonunionized counterparts to receive paid leave, are approximately 18% to 28% more likely to have employer-provided health insurance, and are 23% to 54% more likely to be in employer-provided pension plans. Unionized workers receive more generous health benefits than nonunionized workers. They also pay 18% lower health care deductibles and a smaller share of the costs for family coverage. In retirement, unionized workers are 24% more likely to be covered by health insurance paid for by their employer. • Unionized workers receive better pension plans. Not only are they more likely to have a guaranteed benefit in retirement, their employers contribute 28% more toward pensions. • Unionized workers receive 26% more vacation time and 14% more total paid leave (vacations and holidays).` - [link](https://files.epi.org/page/-/old/briefingpapers/143/bp143.pdf) - How unions help all workers, Mishel and Walters, 2003
- A 2011 report found that:
    - `The social democratic countries (Figure 6) have consistently high levels of union coverage (dashed line) and union membership (solid line). Coverage rates were flat or even rising in all four countries. Membership rates, which are nearly as high as coverage rates, changed little or fell slightly.` `The liberal market economies (Figure 8) generally have relatively low unionization rates and these rates have declined in every one of these countries.` - [link](https://cepr.net/documents/publications/unions-oecd-2011-11.pdf) - Politics Matter. Changes in Unionization Rates in Rich Countries, 1960-2010, Schmitt and Mitukiewicz, 2011
- A 2017 paper found that:
    - `Much of the connection between unions and the distribution of economic resources occurs through political channels. There is extensive evidence, both macro and micro, linking union membership to increased political knowledge, interest, and turnout as well as other forms of participation` - [link](https://www.annualreviews.org/docserver/fulltext/polisci/20/1/annurev-polisci-051215-023225.pdf?expires=1715723790&id=id&accname=guest&checksum=0616FE1045E4A531C023166CBF7858B7) - Labor Unions, Political Representation, and Economic Inequality, Ahlquist, 2017

- A 2020 paper found that:
    - `We find that increasing union density leads to improved firm level productivity in Norway. The negative relationship between union density and productivity apparent in OLS estimates disappears and becomes weakly positive but non-significant once we control for firm fixed effects. However, it becomes statistically significant and strongly positive when we use exogenous variation in the average tax subsidy on union membership fees of the workers in the firm to instrument for union density.` - [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1093/ej/ueaa048) - Union Density Effects on Productivity and Wages, Barth et al., 2020
- A 2021 paper found that:
    - `While previous research finds little evidence that trade unions achieve desirable policy outcomes on issues related to union institutions and activities (Dixon 2010; Masters and Delaney 2005), my findings suggest that organized labor can influence social policy issues that directly benefit nonmembers. A key finding is that states with higher unionization rates—both overall and in the public sector—are faster to adopt leave policies.` - [link](https://sci-hub.ee/10.1093/sf/soaa074) - When Do Unions Matter to Social Policy?

## Abortion
- A 2014 WHO document found that:
    - `Based on 2008 data, WHO estimates that there are approximately 22 million unsafe abortions annually, resulting in 47,000 deaths, and more than 5 million complications such as: incomplete abortion (failure to remove or expel all of the pregnancy tissue from the uterus); haemorrhage (heavy leeding); infection; uterine perforation (caused when the uterus is pierced by a sharp object); and damage to the genital tract and internal organs by inserting dangerous objects such as sticks, knitting needles, or broken glass into the vagina or anus.` `Globally, unsafe abortion accounts for an estimated 13% of all pregnancy-related deaths.` - [link](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/112321/WHO_RHR_14.09_eng.pdf;jsessionid=481B6A58181BB579E0C654F97A1ADEAF?sequence=1) - Preventing Unsafe Abortion, Fact Sheet, World Health Organisation, 2014
- A 2015 WHO document found that:
    - `Restriction in access to safe abortion services results in both unsafe abortions and unwanted births. Almost all deaths and morbidity from unsafe abortion occur in countries where abortion is severely restricted in law and/or in practice.` `Nearly all unsafe abortions (98%) occurred in low- and middle-income countries. One of the factors driving unsafe abortion is the lack of safe abortion services, even where they are legal.` - [link](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/173586/WHO_RHR_15.04_eng.pdf;jsessionid=29C1CFD0AB9731960132761646E95991?sequence=1) - Safe abortion: Technical & policy guidance for health systems. Legal and policy considerations, World Health Organisation, 2015
- A 2015 paper found that:
    - `Results from this study suggest that claims that many women experience abortion decision regret are likely unfounded. The random slope model we fit allowed for individual variability in decision rightness trajectory: some women have lower predicted values of the outcome and others higher values. The typical participant, however, had -99% chance of reporting that the abortion was right for her over three years, and her negative emotions subsided over time. These findings differ from those of the only other large-scale US prospective study, which found that negative emotions increased, and satisfaction with the abortion decision decreased slightly, over two years.` - [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1371/journal.pone.0128832) - Decision Rightness and Emotional Responses to Abortion in the United States: A Longitudinal Study, Rocca et al., 2015
- A 2018 paper found that:
    - `Women seeking abortion reported economic hardships at the time of abortion seeking—half (51%) were living below 100% of the federal poverty level; 3 quarters (76%) reported not having enough money to cover housing, transportation, and food. Most (63%) already had children.` - [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.2105/AJPH.2017.304247?url_ver=Z39.88-2003) - Socioeconomic Outcomes of Women Who Receive and Women Who Are Denied Wanted Abortions in the United States, Foster et al., 2018
- A 2020 paper found that:
    - `We find evidence that being denied an abortion has large and persistent negative effects on a woman’s financial well-being. Women denied an abortion experience a significant increase in financial distress during the year that they give birth (or, in some cases, would have given birth since some of them received an abortion elsewhere or miscarried), compared to their counterparts who received a wanted abortion. Unpaid debts that are 30 or more days past due more than double in size, and the number of public records, which include negative events such as evictions and bankruptcies, increases substantially. This financial impact extends throughout our sample period, with negative effects observed up to four years after the birth year. While we do not find as strong of evidence of changes in the financial independence of these women, as measured through markers of credit access, we do find that the women who were denied an abortion were significantly less likely to have a prime credit score in the two years following the birth.` - [link](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w26662/w26662.pdf) - The Economic Consequences of Being Denied an Abortion, Miller et al., 2020
## Subsidizing Contraception
### Money is saved by the state
- A 2009 paper found that:
    - `We found all contraceptive methods dispensed through Family PACT to be cost-effective. Long-term methods are very cost-effective. Barrier methods and emergency contraceptives tend to yield the lowest savings per dollar spent because of their relatively low efficacy and short duration of use. Higher costs and fewer months of contraceptive protection from the contraceptive patch and ring result in lower cost savings than for oral contraceptives; however, these easier-to-use methods offer enhanced convenience for clients.` - [link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2661445/pdf/446.pdf) - Cost savings from the provision of specific methods of contraception in a publicly funded program, Foster et al., 2009
- A 2017 paper found that:
    - `Our estimates suggest that due to the price hike, the weekly birth rate increased by 4%. We show large effects on the number of children born to unmarried mothers, from mothers in their early 20's, and to primiparae women. Moreover, we find evidence of significant deterioration of newborn health as measured by the incidence of low birthweight and infant mortality. We suggest that the “extra” conceptions faced dire conditions during gestation as a result of mothers' unhealthy behaviors. In addition, we document a disproportional increase of 27% in the weekly miscarriage and stillbirth rates, which we interpret as manifestations of active efforts of termination in a country where abortion was illegal. As the “extra” children reached school age, we find lower school enrollment rates and higher participation in programs for students with special needs. Our results suggest that access to contraceptives may prevent conceptions that will turn out to be in relatively poor health, and thereby may improve the average health of children conceived.` - [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1363/46e1714) - The Children of the Missed Pill, Rau et al., 2017
### Less teen pregnancy
- A 2000 paper found that:
    - `The direct effect of the pill decreased the cost to women of remaining unmarried while investing in a professional career. The pill further reduced the cost of career investment for women by serving to increase the age at first marriage for a large fraction of all young people. The power of the pill in affecting women’s careers was magnified by its impact on the age at first marriage.` - [link](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w7527/w7527.pdf) - The Power Of The Pill: Oral Contraceptives And Women’s Career And Marriage Decisions, Goldin and Katz, 2000
- A 2005 paper found that:
    - `The results suggest that legal access to the pill before age 21 significantly reduced the likelihood of a first birth before age 22, increased the number of women in the paid labor force, and raised the number of annual hours worked.` Access to the pill before the age of 21 reduced the likelihood of being a mother before age 22 by 14-18%, and increased later employment between the ages of 26-30 by 8%.` - [link](https://ir.vanderbilt.edu/bitstream/handle/1803/15760/vu04-wg01R.pdf;jsessionid=09E31BF0CC4543220E675D45EFADDA6D?sequence=1) - More Power To The Pill: The Impact Of Contraceptive Freedom On Women’s Life Cycle Labor Supply, Bailey, 2005
- A 2013 paper found that:
    - `With the passage of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, Congress inadvertently and unexpectedly increased the effective price of birth control pills (“the Pill”) at college health centers more than three-fold, from $5 to $10 a month to between $30 to $50 a month. Using two different data sets, we employ multiple empirical strategies — including interrupted time-series, quasi-difference-in-differences, and fixed effects — for identification, and we find consistent results across data sets and methodologies. Our benchmark estimates show that this policy change reduced use of the Pill by at least 1.5 percentage points, or 3 to 4 percent, among all college women. For college women who lacked health insurance or carried large credit card balances, the decline was two to three times as large.` - [link](https://www.appam.org/assets/1/7/The_Impact_of_Subsidized_Birth_Control_for_College_Women_Evidence_from_the_Deficit.pdf) - The Impact of Subsidized Birth Control for College Women: Evidence from the Deficit Reduction Act, Collins and Hershbein, 2013
- A 2014 CDC paper found that:
    - `Birth rates for U.S. teenagers have generally fallen in the United States since peaking in 1957. The rate fell 57% between 1991 and 2013. The 2013 preliminary rate (26.6 per 1,000 aged 15-19) is less than one-third of the historically highest rate (96.3 in 1957).` `The declines in teen birth rates reflect a number of behavioral changes, including decreased sexual activity, increases in the use of contraception at first sex and at most recent sex, and the adoption and increased use of hormonal contraception, injectables, and intrauterine devices.` - [link](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr63/nvsr63_04.pdf) - National and State Patterns of Teen Births in the United States, 1940–2013, Ventura et al., 2010
- A 2014 paper found that:
    - `The LARC methods it promoted and paid for appeared to contribute to a large decline in fertility among the young, low-income patient population and to a decline in the overall fertility rate among women younger than 25. At the same time, measurable declines occurred in abortion rates, births to young unmarried women with limited education.` - [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1363/46e1714) - Game change in Colorado: widespread use of long-acting reversible contraceptives and rapid decline in births among young, low-income women, Ricketts et al., 2014
### Health impact on women
- A 2002 paper found that:
    - `Among women from 35 to 64 years of age, current or former oral-contraceptive use was not associated with a significantly increased risk of breast cancer` - [link](https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa013202?articleTools=true) - Oral Contraceptives and the Risk of Breast Cancer, Marchbanks et al., 2002
- A 2004 paper found that:
    - `The best overall evidence of noncontraceptive benefits associated with COC use is in the area of risk  
    - reduction for some cancers, maintenance of bone mineral density, and the treatment of moderate acne vulgaris. Although the mechanism is not well understood, COC use has been consistently associated with protection against ovarian and endometrial cancers, based on both case-control and cohort studies. COC use also has been shown to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer. Results of several studies have indicated a positive effect on bone mineral density and, perhaps more importantly, a reduced risk of hip fracture among postmenopausal women who have taken COCs. The data on improvement of acne is so compelling that 2 COCs have been approved by the FDA to treat moderate acne.`

- A 2005 paper found that:
    - `notable effects on the reproductive system include relief from troublesome symptoms associated with menstruation such as heavy periods, painful periods and irregular bleeding. Many women also have improvement in acne and hirsutism. Moreover, OCs may be used to treat menorrhagia or symptomatic endometriosis.` - [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1093/humupd/dmi019) - Noncontraceptive health benefits of combined oral contraception, ESHRE Capri Workshop Group, 2005
- A 2006 paper found that:
    - `Uterine body cancer...and ovarian cancer...showed strong negative associations with duration of OC use...This apparent protective effect for both cancers persisted for more than 20 years after stopping OCs. Combining data for cancers of the cervix, uterine body and ovary, the age adjusted RR for women ever using OCs compared with those never doing so was 0.7 (95%CI, 0.5–0.8). Beneficial effects of OCs on the gynaecological cancers thus outweighed adverse effects.` - [link](https://www.nature.com/articles/6603260.pdf) - Oral contraceptive use and cancer.

### Abstinence only education is ineffective
- A 2008 paper found that:
    - `Teaching about contraception was not associated with increased risk of adolescent sexual activity or STD. Adolescents who received comprehensive sex education had a lower risk of pregnancy than adolescents who received abstinence-only or no sex education.` - [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2007.08.026) - Abstinence-Only and Comprehensive Sex Education and the Initiation of Sexual Activity and Teen Pregnancy, Kohler et al., 2008
## Gun Control
### Problems
- A 2009 paper found that:
    - `On average, guns did not protect those who possessed them from being shot in an assault. Although successful defensive gun uses occur each year, the probability of success may be low for civilian gun users in urban areas. Such users should reconsider their possession of guns or, at least, understand that regular possession necessitates careful safety countermeasures.` - [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.2105/AJPH.2008.143099) - Investigating the Link Between Gun Possession and Gun Assault, Branas et al., 2009
- A 2014 meta-analysis found that:
    - `In summary, we found the association between firearm availability and homicide to be more modest than that between firearm availability and completed suicide. The evidence that we synthesize here helps to elucidate the risks of having a firearm in the home; restricting that access may effectively prevent injury` - [link](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/suppl/10.7326/M13-1301/suppl_file/AIME201401210-00006-v1.pdf) - The Accessibility of Firearms and Risk for Suicide and Homicide Victimization Among Household Members: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis, Anglemyer et al., 2014
- A 2015 paper found that:
    - `Of over 14,000 incidents in which the victim was present, 127 (0.9%) involved a SDGU. SDGU was more common among males, in rural areas, away from home, against male offenders and against offenders with a gun. After any protective action, 4.2% of victims were injured; after SDGU, 4.1% of victims were injured. In property crimes, 55.9% of victims who took protective action lost property, 38.5 of SDGU victims lost property, and 34.9% of victims who used a weapon other than a gun lost property.` - [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1016/j.ypmed.2015.03.029) - The epidemiology of self-defense gun use: evidence from the National Crime Victimization Surveys 2007-2011, Hemenway and Solnick, 2015
- A 2019 paper found that:
    - `The best available evidence using different statistical approaches—panel data regression and synthetic control—with varying strengths and shortcomings and with different model specifications all suggest that the net effect of state adoption of RTC laws is a substantial increase in violent crime. (13-15% higher violent crime)` - [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1111/jels.12219) - Right-to-Carry Laws and Violent Crime: A Comprehensive Assessment Using Panel Data and a State-Level Synthetic Control Analysis, Donohue et al., 2019
- A 2019 paper found that:
    - `This study finds that the rich–poor gap, citizens’ levels of trust in institutions, economic opportunity, and public welfare spending are associated with rates of firearm-related homicides in the US. Further elucidating and modifying the social and economic drivers of firearm related homicides and mass shootings—possibly through candidate levers including taxation policies and policies that increase college affordability—are essential if the US as a nation is to effectively address the epidemic of gun homicides, and reverse recent trends in life expectancy among Americans.` - [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1371/journal.pmed.1002978) - Social determinants of health in relation to firearm-related homicides in the United States: A nationwide multilevel cross-sectional study, Kim, 2019
### Solution - Universal Background Checks
- A 2017 paper found that:
    - `Half of our respondents acquired their most recent gun within the past 5 years (29% within the past 2 years, 21% between 2 and 5 years ago, and the remainder more than 5 years ago). For gun owners who reported acquiring their last firearm within 2 years of the April survey, 22% obtained their most recent gun without a background check` - [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.7326/M16-1590?url_ver=Z39.88-2003) - Firearm Acquisition Without Background Checks: Results of a National Survey, Miller et al., 2017
- A 2020 paper found that:
    - `Universal background checks were associated with 13% lower firearm homicide rates in large cities` `Permit requirements were associated with 21% lower firearm homicide rates in large cities and 20% lower firearm homicide rates in smaller localities.` - [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1111/jrh.12387) - The Impact of State Firearm Laws on Homicide Rates in Suburban and Rural Areas Compared to Large Cities in the United States, 1991-2016, Siegel et al., 2020
### Solution - Gun Buyback Programs
- A 2010 paper found that:
    - `The results in this paper—using a different and more reliable source of identification—support the general findings of those time series studies. We show that the largest falls in firearm deaths occurred in states where more firearms were bought back. Compared to time series studies, this approach has some key benefits. First, it allows us to control for national-level trends in death rates through the use of national-level fixed effects and at the state level through state-specific time trends—the results show that, even after controlling for such trends, there was a statistically significant decline in firearm deaths in states with higher firearm buyback rates. Second, we are able to examine in more depth the time pattern of any response of deaths to the NFA—the results show that firearm deaths in states with higher buyback rates fell relative to those with lower buyback rates and that this relative reduction in the firearm death rate was maintained subsequently. Finally, we use an instrumental variables strategy to allow for possible endogeneity in the gun buyback rate and find that this makes no substantive difference to the results. That the results in the baseline regression are robust to all three approaches suggests that the relationship between buyback rates and death rates is likely causal.` - [link](http://andrewleigh.org/pdf/GunBuyback_Panel.pdf) - Do Gun Buybacks Save Lives? Evidence from Panel Data, Leigh and Neill, 2010
### Solution - Gun Permits
- A 2015 paper found that:
    - `The synthetic control model estimated a 15.4% reduction in firearm suicide rates associated with Connecticut's PTP law. Missouri's PTP law repeal was associated with a 16.1% increase in firearm suicide rates. Evidence that PTP laws were associated with non-firearm suicide rates was mixed in Connecticut and negative in Missouri.` - [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1016/j.ypmed.2015.07.013) - Effects of changes in permit-to-purchase handgun laws in Connecticut and Missouri on suicide rates, Crifasi et al., 2015
- A 2020 paper found that:
    - `Permit requirements were associated with 21% lower firearm homicide rates (95% CI: 14%-28%) in large cities and 20% lower firearm homicide rates (95% CI: 7%-31%) in smaller localities.` - [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1111/jrh.12387) - The Impact of State Firearm Laws on Homicide Rates in Suburban and Rural Areas Compared to Large Cities in the United States, 1991-2016, Siegel et al., 2020
### Solution - Waiting Periods
- A 2017 paper found that:
    
    - `The results of Table 1 show that waiting periods are associated with a 17% reduction in gun homicides. This effect is equivalent to ∼36 fewer gun homicides per year for a state with an average number of gun deaths. Waiting periods also lead to a 7–11% reduction in gun suicides (depending on the control variables used in the specification), which is equivalent to 22–35 fewer gun suicides per year for the average state.` - [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1073/pnas.1619896114) - Handgun waiting periods reduce gun deaths, Luca et al., 2017
    
# Criminal Justice Policy
## Rehabilitative Justice
- A 2005 meta-analysis found that:
    
    - `restorative justice programs, on average, yielded reductions in recidivism compared to nonrestorative approaches to criminal behavior. In fact, compared to the comparison and/or control groups who did not participate in a restorative justice program, offenders in the treatment groups were significantly more successful during the follow-up periods` - [link](https://sci-hub.ee/10.1177/0032885505276969) - The Effectiveness of Restorative Justice Practices: A Meta-Analysis, Latimer et al., 2005
    
- A 2014 RAND meta-analysis found that:
    
    - `With respect to recidivism, based on the higher-quality research studies, we found that, on average, inmates who participated in correctional education programs had a 43 percent lower odds of recidivating than inmates who did not, thus indicating that correctional education is an effective strategy for reducing recidivism.` `This translates to a reduction in the risk of recidivating of 13 percentage points for those who participated in correctional education programs versus those who did not.` - [link](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR500/RR564/RAND_RR564.pdf) - How Effective Is Correctional Education, and Where Do We Go from Here? The Results of a Comprehensive Evaluation, Davis et al., 2014
    
- A 2014 paper found that:
    
    - `The vast majority of violent crimes are perpetrated by a small number of persistent violent offenders, almost all males, who have an early onset of violent criminality and display substance use problems, personality disorders, and nonviolent criminality. These findings support the provision of far-reaching interventions among young individuals who have committed one or two violent crimes and are at risk of developing persistent violent criminal behavior.` - [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1007/s00127-013-0783-y) - The 1% of the population accountable for 63 % of all violent crime convictions, Falk et al., 2014
    
- A 2015 paper found that:
    
    - `We find that one-month extra prison sentence reduces the rate of recidivism by about one percentage point, with possibly larger effects for those with limited criminal histories. However, the reduction in recidivism comes almost entirely in the first year of release, which we interpret as consistent with prison’s rehabilitative role.` - [link](https://sci-hub.ee/10.2139/ssrn.2701549) - The Effect of Prison Sentence Length on Recidivism: Evidence from Random Judicial Assignment, Roach and Schanzenbach, 2015
    
## Death Penalty
- A 2003 report found that
    - `Cases in which the death penalty was sought and imposed could cost about 70% more than cases in which the death penalty wasn’t sought. The estimated median cost of a case in which the death sentence was given was $1.2 million, compared to the same estimated costs for a non-death penalty case of about $740,000.` - [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20151109015151/http://www.kslpa.org/assets/files/reports/04pa03a.pdf)
- In Tennessee, death penalty trials cost an average of 48% more than the average cost of trials in which prosecutors seek life imprisonment. [link](http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/documents/deathpenalty.pdf)
- In Maryland death penalty cases cost 3 times more than non-death penalty cases, or $3 million for a single case. [link](http://www.urban.org/UploadedPDF/411625_md_death_penalty.pdf)
- In California the current system costs $137 million per year; it would cost $11.5 million for a system without the death penalty. [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20120229154704/http://www.deathpenalty.org/downloads/FINAL%20REPORT%20DEATH%20PENALTY%20ccfaj%20June%2030.2008.pdf)

## Systemic Racism
### Employment Discrimination
- A 2004 paper found that:
    
    - `This paper suggests that discrimination is an important factor in why African Americans do poorly in the  
    - labor market. Job applicants with African American names get far fewer callbacks for each resume they send out. Equally importantly, applicants with African American names find it hard to fight discrimination  
    - in callbacks by improving their observable skills or credentials.`

- A 2017 meta-analysis, building on the methodology of [[Political Positions]], found that:
    
    - `On average, white applicants receive 36% more callbacks than equally qualified African Americans (95% confidence interval of 25–47% more), based on random-effects meta-analysis of data since 1989, representing a substantial degree of direct discrimination. White applicants receive on average 24% more callbacks than Latinos (95% confidence interval of 15–33% more).` - [link](https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.1706255114) - Meta-analysis of field experiments shows no change in racial discrimination in hiring over time, Quillian et al., 2017
    
### Judicial Discrimination
- A 2005 meta-analysis found that:
    
    - `the independent effects of these variables are unknown. Consequently, the only conclusion that can be firmly drawn regarding the influence of race on Federal sentencing outcomes is that the effect of race was larger in more recent analyses of Federal sentencing practices` - [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1007/s10940-005-7362-7) - A Meta-Analysis of Race and Sentencing Research: Explaining the Inconsistencies, Mitchell, 2005
    
- A 2012 paper found that:
    
    - `there is substantial excess heterogeneity in the empirical distribution of the racial gap in the incarceration rate. The quantitative impact of this gap on sentencing disparity is of considerable magnitude. If a defendant assigned to a 10th-percentile judge was instead sentenced by a 90th-percentile judge, the racial gap in the incarceration rate would rise by a full 18 percentage points.` - [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1086/666006) - Do Judges Vary in Their Treatment of Race?, Abrams et al., 2012
    
- A 2014 paper found that:
    
    - `Using rich new linked data that allow us to address the sample selection problems and other limitations that have pervaded prior research, this paper provides robust evidence that black male federal arrestees ultimately face longer prison terms than whites arrested for the same offenses with the same prior records,` - [link](https://repository.law.umich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2413&context=articles) - Racial Disparity in Federal Criminal Sentences, Rehavi and Starr, 2014
    
- A 2019 report found that:
    
    - `sentence length continues to be associated with some demographic factors, in particular race and gender. After controlling for a wide variety of sentencing factors, the Commission found that Black male offenders continued to receive longer sentences than similarly situated White male offenders, and that female offenders of all races received shorter sentences than White male offenders.` - [link](https://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/research-and-publications/research-publications/2017/20171114_Demographics.pdf) - Demographic Differences in Sentencing: An Update to the 2012 Booker Report, Pryor et al., 2017
    
### Correctional Discrimination
- A 2020 paper found that:
    
    - `Our analysis provides evidence that decisions about whom to stop and, subsequently, whom to search are biased against black and Hispanic drivers.` `Our primary dataset thus consists of approximately 95 million stops from 21 state patrol agencies and 35 municipal police departments` `In our veil-of-darkness analysis, we compared stop rates before sunset and after dusk—as is common when applying this test` ` In all cases, we found qualitatively similarly results that are suggestive of racial bias against black drivers in stop decisions` - [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1038/s41562-020-0858-1) - A large-scale analysis of racial disparities in police stops across the United States, Pierson et al., 2020
    
### Economic Mobility
- A 2012 report found that:
    
    - `Blacks are more likely to be stuck in the bottom and fall from the middle than are whites. Over half of blacks (53 percent) raised in the bottom of the family income ladder remain stuck in the bottom as adults, compared with only a third (33 percent) of whites. Half of blacks (56 percent) raised in the middle of the family income ladder fall to the bottom two rungs as adults compared with just under a third of whites (32 percent). Half of blacks (50 percent) raised in the bottom of the family wealth ladder remain stuck in the bottom as adults, compared with only a third (33 percent) of whites. More than two-thirds of blacks (68 percent) raised in the middle fall to the bottom two rungs of the ladder as adults compared with just under a third of whites (30 percent).` - [link](https://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/legacy/uploadedfiles/pcs_assets/2012/pursuingamericandreampdf.pdf) - Pursuing the American Dream: Economic Mobility Across Generations, The Pew Charitable Trusts, 2012
    
## Stop and Frisk
- A 2012 study finds few effects of stop-and-frisk on robbery and burglary rates in New York between 2003 and 2010. [link](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07418825.2012.712152?journalCode=rjqy20)
- A 2016 study found no evidence that stop-and-frisk was effective. One of the authors of that study, Jeffrey Fagan of Columbia University, said that `you can achieve really very positive crime control, reductions in crime, if you do stop using those probable-cause standards. If you just leave it up to the officers, based on their hunches, then they have almost no effect on crime.` - [link](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/09/22/donald-trump-claims-new-yorks-stop-and-frisk-policy-reduced-crime-the-data-disagree/) Fagan `found stops based on probable cause standards of criminal behavior were associated with a 5–9 percent decline in NYC crime in census block groups.` - [link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4911104)
- A 2016 study found that stop-and-frisk lowered crime, and that the size of the effect was `significant yet modest`. The authors also noted that `the level of SQFs needed to produce meaningful crime reductions are costly in terms of police time and are potentially harmful to police legitimacy.` - [link](https://doi.org/10.1111%2F1745-9133.12172)
- A 2017 study also reported that stop-and-frisk was associated with modest crime reductions, and cautioned against drawing strong causal conclusions. [link](https://doi.org/10.1080%2F07418825.2016.1275748)
- A 2017 study in The Journal of Politics found that the introduction of a mandate in 2013 that officers provide thorough justifications for stopping suspects led to far fewer stops, far fewer detainments of innocent people and increased the ratio of stops that ultimately produced evidence of the crime that the police stopped the suspect for.

# Economic Policy
## Keynesian Economics
### Deficit Spending
- Deficit Spending is when a government's expenditures exceed its revenues during a fiscal period, causing it to run a budget deficit. The phrase `deficit spending` often implies a Keynesian approach to economic stimulus, in which the government takes on debt while using its spending power to create demand and stimulate the economy. [link](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deficit-spending.asp)

### Keynes’s General Theory
- Michał Kalecki, a Polish economist that was trained in Marxist Political Economy, was said to have discovered a large amount of what would later constitute Keynes’s General Theory. In some ways, Kalecki is said to be the bridge of Marx and Keynes.

## Progressive Income Tax
- A progressive income tax is a tax on income in which the tax rate increases as the taxable amount increases.
### 1979 Thatcher Tax Cuts
- In the first budget after her election victory in 1979, the top rate was reduced from 83% to 60% and the basic rate from 33% to 30%. [link]
- The Thatcher Poll tax was a system of taxation introduced by Margaret Thatcher‘s government in 1989/90. It provided for a single flat-rate, per-capita tax on every adult, at a rate set by the local authority. People in employment had to pay 100% of the tax, while students and the registered unemployed paid 20% of the tax. [link]
- UK unemployment rose after the poll tax was implemented and lowered after it was removed by John Major in 1993 and  
    replaced with council tax. March 1990: 6.9%, March 1993: 10.5%. [link]  
    
- UK GDP fell to stagnant and negative levels after the poll tax was implemented and flowed after it was removed by John Major in 1993 and replaced with council tax. [link]
### 1981 Reagan Tax Cuts

### 1986 Reagan Tax Cuts
- [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reagan_tax_cuts)
### 2001 Bush Tax Cuts
- Bush’s tax bills (`Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001` and `Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003`) reduced the marginal income tax rate from 39.6% to 35%.
- In 2017, a Center on Budget and Policy Priorities report found that,
    
    - `Job growth, economic growth, and small business job creation were much weaker following the George W. Bush tax cuts, which gave the biggest boosts to high-income households, than after the Clinton tax increases on high-income households.` - [link](https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/tax-cuts-for-the-rich-arent-an-economic-panacea-and-could-hurt-growth) - Tax Cuts for the Rich Aren’t an Economic Panacea — and Could Hurt Growth, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, 2017
    
    - `After the Bush tax cuts for the very highest-income households expired at the end of 2012, the economy continued to grow and add jobs steadily.` - [link](https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/tax-cuts-for-the-rich-arent-an-economic-panacea-and-could-hurt-growth) - Tax Cuts for the Rich Aren’t an Economic Panacea — and Could Hurt Growth, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, 2017
    
    - `The Bush tax cuts included sharp tax cuts on capital gains and dividends that proponents said would spur immediate business growth, but a recent study found “empirical evidence that the 2003 tax cuts had little impact on investment or employment.” And, in the words of The Wall Street Journal, Federal Reserve economists found the 2003 tax cut `was a dud when it came to boosting the stock market.”` - [link](https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/tax-cuts-for-the-rich-arent-an-economic-panacea-and-could-hurt-growth) - Tax Cuts for the Rich Aren’t an Economic Panacea — and Could Hurt Growth, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, 2017
    
    - `The drag from deficit-increasing tax cuts for the wealthy on the economy is a key reason why the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that allowing the high-income Bush tax cuts to expire and using the savings to cut the deficit would improve long-term economic growth.` - [link](https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/tax-cuts-for-the-rich-arent-an-economic-panacea-and-could-hurt-growth) - Tax Cuts for the Rich Aren’t an Economic Panacea — and Could Hurt Growth, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, 2017
    
### 2017 Trump Tax Cuts
- On his first day in office, Trump reversed a middle class tax cut in mortgage insurance premiums issued by the Federal Housing Administration. These insurance fees are effectively a tax on middle-class homeownership. For a mortgage worth $200,000, this adds $500 to a homebuyer’s annual costs. [link](https://theintercept.com/2017/01/20/on-his-first-day-in-office-trump-raises-taxes-on-middle-class-homebuyers/)
- Trump's tax proposal (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017) would reduce the corporate tax rate to 20% from 35%. The Trump Treasury Department released a one-page summary of the nearly 500-page Senate tax bill that suggested the tax cut would more than pay for itself, based on an assumption of higher economic growth than any independent analysis had forecast. [link](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/11/us/politics/treasury-tax.html) Every detailed, independent analysis found that the enacted tax cut would increase budget deficits. [link](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/15/business/economy/survey-trump-economy.html)
- The CBO estimated in April 2018 that implementing the Act would add an estimated $2.289 trillion to the national debt over ten years. [link](https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/115th-congress-2017-2018/reports/53651-outlook.pdf\#page=133)
- Analysis conducted by The New York Times in November 2019 found that average business investment was lower after the tax cut than before, and that firms receiving larger tax relief increased investment less than firms receiving smaller tax relief. The analysis also found that since the tax cut firms increased dividends and stock buybacks by nearly three times as much as they increased capital investments. [link](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/17/business/how-fedex-cut-its-tax-bill-to-0.html)
- A study found ‘379 large, profitable U.S. companies in 2018 paid an effective tax rate of 11.3%’, the first year the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was in force. That's slightly more than half of the nominal corporate tax rate of 21%, which itself was reduced by the TCJA from a previous rate of 35%. [link](https://itep.org/corporate-tax-avoidance-in-the-first-year-of-the-trump-tax-law/)
- Trump’s Treasury Department has been on record for Deleted Research That Contradicts Republicans on Tax Reform. `In an interview on Fox News last month, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin made a sales pitch for the GOP’s tax reform plan—specifically, its plan to cut corporate taxes. `Most economists believe that over 70 percent of corporate taxes are paid for by the workers,` he said. His implication, in layman's terms: Regular workers would get 70 percent of the benefit of corporate tax cuts.` - [link](https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2017/10/trumps-treasury-department-deleted-research-that-contradicts-republicans-on-tax-reform/)
- Another study found 83% of the benefits of the Trump tax bill will go to the top 1%.
    - `We find the bill would reduce taxes on average for all income groups in both 2018 and 2025.` ` On average, in 2027 taxes would change little for lower- and middle-income groups and decrease for higher-income groups. Compared to current law, 5 percent of taxpayers would pay more tax in 2018, 9 percent in 2025, and 53 percent in 2027.` - [link](https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/distributional-analysis-conference-agreement-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act)
### General Papers on Taxation Effects
- A 1983 paper found that:
    
    - `The rapid increases in Swedish payroll taxes, occurring especially during the 70s, were presumably based on the notion of backward shifting. The evidence given in this paper suggests that the payroll tax increases were partly shifted back as lower wage increases, but that this shifting was far from complete. The estimates indicate that about 50 percent of a payroll tax increase was directly shifted back within one year.` - [link](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/94678/1/wp068.pdf) - Payroll Taxes and Wage Inflation: The Swedish Experience, Holmlund, 1983
    
- A 1987 paper found that:
    
    - `Our principal conclusions are two. First, while the introduction of an actuarially fair Social Security system leads to a significant increase in lifetime consumption and welfare, accompanied by a reduction in the capital stock, the gain is reduced-and in some cases eliminated-in the presence of realistic restrictions on borrowing. Extending the model to general equilibrium, we find that the partial-equilibrium gains in lifetime welfare from participation in Social Security are offset by the interaction of higher steady-state interest rates and binding liquidity constraints. Indeed, the steady-state welfare cost of Social Security under proportional payroll tax finance can be substantial. Second, replacing the proportional payroll tax with a progressive tax (essentially a linear tax with an exemption), we show that age-specific tax schemes can restore much of the potential gain from participating in Social Security.` - [link](https://sci-hub.ee/https://www.jstor.org/stable/1814536) - Social Security and Individual Welfare: Precautionary Saving, Borrowing Constraints, and the Payroll Tax, Hubbard and Judd, 1987
    
- A 2001 paper found that:
    
    - `Using longitudinal data over the 80s, and comparing years of increasing minimum costs with years of decreasing minimum costs, we show the negative effect of minimum cost increases on the employment of minimum wage workers. Our estimates, based on a difference-indifference, approach suggest that the elasticity of labor demand is roughly equal to –1.5 for this group. A similar analysis of the re-employment impact of tax subsidies gives small and insignificant positive effects on minimum wage workers. In fact, it seems that all workers in the tax subsidy zone benefit from the cost decreases.` - [link](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/21065/1/dp219.pdf) - The impact of differential payroll tax subsidies on minimum wage employment, Kramarz and Philippon, 2001
    
- A 2000 paper found that:
    
    - `Our estimates imply that a country contemplating a move to full experience rating might expect UI claim rates to fall between 10 and 33 percent, and the seasonality of this rate to fall 16–40 percent. Similarly, a drop of about 11 percent in the seasonal range of employment would be predicted. These results clearly suggest that experience rating reduces UI claims and stabilizes employment. Both of these changes mean lower unemployment and, thus, likely higher social welfare.` - [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1016/s0047-2727(99)00112-7) - The effects of the unemployment insurance payroll tax on wages, employment, claims and denials, Anderson and Meyer, 2000
    
- A 2007 paper found that:
    
    - `The evidence indicates that there may be a link between progressive taxes and higher revenues and a more equitable income distribution. The link to portfolio flows, output volatility, and growth is ambiguous. Progressive taxation does appear to be associated with larger budget deficits, but a VAT does not bring salvation. Specifically, a higher VAT is associated with more volatility. When VAT levels are considered in combination with progressive taxes, a high VAT and progressive taxation provide high revenue and high volatility, whereas the opposite is true for low VAT and progressive taxation.` - [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1177%2F0486613407305286) - The Benefits of Progressive Taxation in Economic Development, Weller, 2007
    
- A 2009 paper found that:
    
    - `We do find significant estimates of positive wage effects; the wage incidence is on average 1/4 of the payroll tax reduction. This result is also in line with previous empirical research. Our results are consistent with the interpretation that in the wage bargaining process the employers and the unions treat the cost reduction as a windfall gain which they split among themselves. That the employers are able to reap 75 percent of the gain indicates that their bargaining power markedly exceeds that of the unions.` - [link](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/45771/1/578827638.pdf) - Do regional payroll tax reductions boost employment?, Bennmarker et al., 2009

- A 2012 paper found that:
    
    - `In this paper, we estimate jointly the gross labor income responses to marginal and average tax rates for both income and payroll tax schedules. To identify the responses to the payroll tax schedule, we use the changes in the employer payroll tax reduction for low-paid jobs that occurred in France over the period 2003-2006. To identify the responses to the income tax schedule, we use the increase in working tax credit for low wage earners that took place over the same period. We find a significant elasticity of gross labor income with respect to the marginal net-of-income-tax rate around 0.2 and our results suggest that this effect is driven by married women’s labor supply decisions. Conversely, we find no significant effect of marginal net-of-payroll-tax rates on gross labor income. This discrepancy appears robust across specifications and sample selections. It is in contradiction with the prediction of identical responses to income tax and to payroll tax reforms that is common to a large class of labor market models, in particular the competitive labor supply framework, which is central in the optimal income taxation literature` - [link](https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/file/index/docid/856246/filename/12-017.pdf) - Labor Income Responds Differently to Income-Tax and Payroll-Tax Reforms, Lehmann et al., 2012
    
- A 2013 paper found that:
    
    - `This paper studies whether large-scale payroll tax reductions for employers of young workers is an effective means to raise youth employment. In 2007–08, payroll taxes in Sweden were cut with 11 percentage points for employers of workers at 19–25 years of age. We estimate the effect of this substantial tax cut to be, at most, an employment increase at around 2.7 percent. We find no employment effect of an extension of the original reductions, implemented in 2009. Shifting of the tax cut onto workers in the form of higher wages cannot explain the modest employment effect: the size of the wage adjustments in the wake of the reform is small, at roughly one percent. The employment and wage estimates in combination imply that the elasticity of demand for young workers in Sweden is at around −0.31. Using a different metric: the estimated cost per created job for 19–25 year-olds was SEK 1.0 to 1.6 million ($150,000 to $240,000). Since we are likely to overestimate the employment increase, these figures are most likely overly optimistic. We conclude that targeted payroll tax cuts are an expensive way to boost employment for young individuals.` - [link](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/106281/1/775177512.pdf) - Do payroll tax cuts raise youth employment?, Egebark and Kaunitz, 2013
    
- A 2019 paper found that:
    
    - `the stimulative effects of income tax cuts are largely driven by tax cuts for the bottom 90% and that the empirical link between employment growth and tax changes for the top 10% is weak to negligible over a business cycle frequency.` - [link](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w21035/w21035.pdf) - Tax Cuts for Whom? Heterogeneous Effects of Income Tax Changes on Growth and Employment, Zidar, 2019
    
- A 2015 report found that:
    
    - `States considering personal income tax cuts this legislative session should be skeptical of claims that these tax cuts will improve the state’s economic performance. In the last two decades, a number of states have cut taxes deeply in hopes of spurring economic gains, with unimpressive results. That’s not surprising given that the preponderance of the peer-reviewed academic studies indicate that state and local personal income tax levels do not affect economic performance.  
    -   
    - Rather than bet their futures on a tax-cutting approach that has not worked well in the past, states would do better to concern themselves with improving their schools, transportation networks, and other public services that act as building blocks of economic growth.`

## Wealth Tax
- Bernie supports [**Wealth Tax**](https://berniesanders.com/issues/tax-extreme-wealth/).
- Bernie says it will raise an estimated $4.35 trillion. According to the [**Tax Foundation**](https://taxfoundation.org/wealth-tax/), it would **only raise $2.6 trillion**.
- The effect of the Swiss tax and Warren tax on wealth inequality is [**miniscule**](http://www.pse-journal.hr/upload/files/pse/2020/2/1.pdf).
- The wealth tax would [**decrease long-run GDP by 0.43% and also doubling the trade deficit**](https://files.taxfoundation.org/20200127123048/Analysis-of-Sen.-Warren-and-Sen.-Sanders%E2%80%99-Wealth-Tax-Plans.pdf).
- European countries that had wealth taxes [**have shown disappointing results and have been phased out**](https://taxfoundation.org/wealth-tax-repeal-wealth-taxes-in-europe/).
- A wealth tax would [**mitigate foreign inflows of billions of dollars a year to replace reductions in US spending**](https://files.taxfoundation.org/20200127123048/Analysis-of-Sen.-Warren-and-Sen.-Sanders%E2%80%99-Wealth-Tax-Plans.pdf).
## Minimum Wage
- There are two scenarios in which are most successful and applicable to the majority of countries, an indexed minimum wage not requiring (but not disencouraging) strong unions, or no minimum wage policies with strong unions and sectoral bargaining, namely the nordic model.
- Seattle is a well studied case for indexed minimum wage which is attached to the areas Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers or CPI-W, [link](https://lni.wa.gov/workers-rights/wages/minimum-wage/history-of-washington-states-minimum-wage) and that the U.S. is known for its low membership of Unions. [link](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/union2.nr0.htm)
- Whilst it has all the positive effects of increasing the minimum wage does, the problem is whilst adaptive to the general labor market and its median wages, it doesn't address individual sectoral downsides minimum wage might impact negatively, so whilst the average wage across an area would rise, because certain sectors cant uphold the wage for the same hours, they either cut the amount of hours or close the business.
    
    - `Research on the effects of minimum wage laws on low-wage workers suggests that the policy increases wages but can also lead to small reductions in hours and employment as employers adjust to higher costs` - [link](https://ejournals.bib.uni-wuppertal.de/index.php/sws/article/view/538/1063) - Responding to an Increased Minimum Wage: A Mixed Methods Study of Child Care Businesses during the Implementation of Seattle's Minimum Wage Ordinance, Otten et al., 2018
    
    - `we conclude that the second wage increase to $13 reduced hours worked in low-wage jobs by 6-7 percent, while hourly wages in such jobs increased by 3 percent.` - [link](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w23532/w23532.pdf) - Minimum Wage Increases, Wages, and Low-Wage Employment: Evidence from Seattle, Jardim et al., 2017
    
- This problem is analogous to that in the U.S, minimum wage as a federal law on the state level, that because of the varied different standards of living, a set level across the entire country has big varied economic impact, it's debatable on whether that would be net positive or negative but as the effect in general would be so big, it's safe to assume both the positive and negatives would also be big.
- The nordic model is an example of no legally set minimum wage but strong unions with sectoral bargaining meaning that even with no minimum wage laws, the minimum wage tends to hover near 60% to 70% of the average wage in Sweden. and strong labor force protections.

    - `Unions raise wages for all types of workers. When unionized workers are compared with similar nonunionized counterparts, analysis shows union wages are about 12 percent higher.` `Union employers, compared with similar nonunion employers: Contribute 56 percent more toward workers’ retirement, Pay 77 percent more toward workers’ health care, Provide 11 percent more toward paid vacation and holidays.

- Whilst it has all the positive effects of increasing the minimum wage does, the problem is that this results in next to no leverage for the workers in companies with no union organisation and for a country with no legal minimum wage, there's no insurance to a livable or even received wage.
## Redistributive Cash Transfers
- In 2012, A test of a RCT was conducted in the Philippines, in which families would be given **conditional** grants of flat, untaxed payment depending on their financial and familial situation. The program primarily aimed to test RCT’s ability to break generational poverty and benefit children's future. Parents with children ranging age 0-14 are eligible for the health grants, receiving a total of ₱500 monthly, as long as conditions as to how well families follow health guidelines are met. For the education grants, the only conditions to apply for the benefit of ₱300 per child monthly are to have a child 6-14 in a low-income area, and to make sure the child attends at least 85% of school days.
- Attendance in preschool or daycare was 10.3% higher than the baseline of 65% for the low-income families without the RCT. Similarly, in children aged 6-11, enrolment in elementary school rose 4.5% higher than the baseline 93% in other low income households. However, for children 15-17, RCT had a **slight negative** effect on enrolment, but the RCT **did not** apply to the age group, so a positive effect on education **was not expected for those 15-17.** Similarly to the benefits in enrolment in most age groups, attendance in school **increased** in all age groups.
- Access to prenatal and postnatal care greatly increased for women affected by the RCT health benefits. (Prenatal by 10.5% and postnatal by 10%). It was also found that pregnant recipients of RCT made visits to prenatal facilities 1.6x more than the control. RCT also reduced severe stunting in affected children 6-36 months old by 10.1% from the 24% baseline. Alcohol consumption **reduced** by 39% in households affected by RCT.
- Poor households receiving RCT increased spending on health services by 34%, increased spending on education by 38%, and increased spending on protein-rich foods by 38%. There was a reduction in poverty three years after the program’s initiation by 2.7%. This impact is small, but would likely increase as more time under the program passes for affected families. It was found there was **no significant change** in motivation to work. [link](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/13244/755330REVISED000Revised0June0402014.pdf)
- This source lists three pro-RCT points, said points being:
    
    - RCTs have positive effects on children, primarily increased weight for age and weight for height, 15% decreased rates of low birth-weight, and increased school attendance.
    
    - Recipients of RCT use the income well, causing it to create long term benefit. Men’s income increased by 64-96% five years after receiving a transfer.
    
    - Those receiving transfers don’t expend their income on unneeded commodities such as alcohol. There is also no significant impact on work-hours. [link](https://www.givedirectly.org/research-on-cash-transfers/)
    
- A World Bank blog post from 2014 makes the claim that recipients of RCT and UBI **do not** use their given income on goods such as alcohol. Examples are as follows:
    
    - When examining 44 estimates of alcohol consumption across 19 studies and 13 interventions, the majority of studies report results of reduced alcohol consumption (82%).
    
    - There is little to no incentive for recipients to lie. The surveyors intentionally do not add items such as alcohol in separate lists, and treat them with the same significance as other household items. It’s also been shown that those with a non-zero baseline for alcohol don’t suddenly report spending nothing on alcohol, instead, they still tend to report a decreased, but not non-zero spending on alcohol. This trend implies that recipients do not try to “game the system,” and rather remain honest about their expenditures.

## Multilateral & Liberalized Trade
### Liberalization of Trade
- A 2004 paper found that:
    
    - `Theory provides a strong presumption that trade liberalization will be poverty-alleviating in the long run and on average. The empirical evidence broadly supports this view, and, in particular, lends no support to the position that trade liberalization generally has an adverse impact.` - [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1257/002205104773558056) - Trade Liberalization and Poverty: The Evidence So Far, Winters et al., 2004
    
- A 2006 World Bank paper found that:
    
    - `The estimated average increase in growth varies between 1.2 and 2.6 percent according to which specification we use to take into account the evolution of other growth determinants and is statistically significant under all specifications.` - [link](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/8864/wps4062.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) - Growth Before And After Trade Liberalization, Salinas and Aksoy, 2006
    
- A 2008 World Bank paper found that:
    
    - `Over the 1950–98 period, countries that liberalized their trade regimes experienced average annual growth rates that were about 1.5 percentage points higher than before liberalization. Postliberalization investment rates rose 1.5–2.0 percentage points, confirming past findings that liberalization fosters growth in part through its effect on physical capital accumulation. Liberalization raised the average trade to GDP ratio by roughly 5 percentage points, after controlling for year effects, suggesting that trade policy liberalization did indeed raise the actual level of openness of liberalizers.` - [link](http://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/660841468162283031/pdf/775730JRN020080alization0and0Growth.pdf) - Trade Liberalization and Growth: New Evidence, Wacziarg and Welch, 2008
    
- A 2014 literature review found that:
    
    - `The literature of the past decade reinforces the presumption that trade liberalization generally raises average incomes (i.e., boosts economic growth temporarily), and shows that the response to trade liberalization is likely to vary with a series of complementary conditions, many of which refer to the ease with which factors of production can migrate between sectors.`[link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1146/annurev-resource-110713-105054) - Trade Liberalization and Poverty: What Have We Learned in a Decade?, Winters and Martuscelli, 2014
    
- A 2016 paper found that:
    
    - `The multi-sector analysis reveals that the gains from trade are typically biased towards the poor. This is because the poor tend to concentrate expenditures in sectors that are more traded, and because these sectors have lower price elasticities` - [link](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w20331/w20331.pdf) - Measuring the Unequal Gains from Trade, Fajgelbaum and Khandelwal, 2014
    
### Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership
- The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) was a proposed trade agreement between the European Union and the United States.
- The TTIP would have increased the EU's economy by €120 billion, the US's economy by €90 billion, and the rest of the world by €100 billion, this would translate to an extra €545 in disposable income per family in the EU, and €655 per family in the US.

### Trans-Pacific Partnership
- The now dead, Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP) was a proposed trade agreement between Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, Vietnam, and the United States signed on 4 February 2016. After the newly elected US president Donald Trump withdrew the US signature from TPP in January 2017, the agreement could not be ratified as required and did not enter into force. The remaining countries negotiated a new trade agreement called Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, which incorporates most of the provisions of the TPP and which entered into force on 30 December 2018.
- In 2016, the U.S. International Trade Commission report on its projection of the TPP was positive on all fronts.
    
    - Economy-Wide effects, `the TPP Agreement would increase annual U.S. GDP in 2032 relative to the 2032 baseline by $42.7 billion in 2017 dollars, or by 0.15 percent of total U.S. GDP` - [link](https://www.usitc.gov/publications/332/pub4607.pdf) - Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement: Likely Impact on the U.S. Economy and on Specific Industry Sectors, United States International Trade Commission, 2016
    
    - Broad Sector Level Effects, `While output and employment would increase in the overall economy due to TPP, this change would be driven by expansion in the agriculture and food sector and the services sector. In dollar terms, the output of the services sector would expand the most ($42.3 billion) relative to its baseline volume in 2032` - [link](https://www.usitc.gov/publications/332/pub4607.pdf) - Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement: Likely Impact on the U.S. Economy and on Specific Industry Sectors, United States International Trade Commission, 2016
    
    - Industry Level Effects, `Sectors benefiting from the most extensive liberalization measures tend to expand production and exports as they become relatively more competitive in the world economy: these are the direct effects of TPP.` - [link](https://www.usitc.gov/publications/332/pub4607.pdf) - Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement: Likely Impact on the U.S. Economy and on Specific Industry Sectors, United States International Trade Commission, 2016
    
- In 2016, the World Bank found that,
    
    - `By shifting resources towards the most productive firms and sectors and expanding export markets, TPP has the potential to lift overall GDP of member countries by 1.1 percent by 2030.` - [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20160212030617/http://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/Worldbank/GEP/GEP2016a/Global-Economic-Prospects-January-2016-Implications-Trans-Pacific-Partnership-Agreement.pdf) - Potential Macroeconomic Implications Of The Trans-Pacific Partnership, Global Economic Prospects, 2016
    
    - `TPP could also lift member countries’ trade by 11 percent by 2030.` - [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20160212030617/http://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/Worldbank/GEP/GEP2016a/Global-Economic-Prospects-January-2016-Implications-Trans-Pacific-Partnership-Agreement.pdf) - Potential Macroeconomic Implications Of The Trans-Pacific Partnership, Global Economic Prospects, 2016
    
- In 2016, the Office of the Chief Economist at Global Affairs Canada found that,
    
    - `Joining the TPP would provide a net advantage to Canada resulting from increased market access and greater regional economic integration with Asia-Pacific countries. Should Canada choose to be a party to the TPP Agreement, this is projected to boost Canada’s GDP by a permanent 0.127 percent above baseline performance, generating GDP gains of $4.3 billion (US$3.3 billion) in the longer term (by 2040).` - [link](https://www.international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/economist-economiste/analysis-analyse/tpp_ei-re_ptp.aspx?lang=eng) - Economic Impact of Canada’s Potential Participation in the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement, 2021
    
    - `According to our modelling results, should Canada choose to remain outside the TPP Agreement, and all other current TPP members are parties to it, this is projected to lead to GDP losses of $5.3 billion (US$ 4.2 billion).` - [link](https://www.international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/economist-economiste/analysis-analyse/tpp_ei-re_ptp.aspx?lang=eng) - Economic Impact of Canada’s Potential Participation in the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement, 2021
    
### Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership
- The Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), is a trade agreement among Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, and Vietnam. It evolved from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which never entered into force due to the withdrawal of the United States.
- In 2018, the Office of the Chief Economist at Global Affairs Canada found that,
    
    - `Joining the CPTPP is expected to provide a net advantage to Canada resulting from increased market access and greater regional economic integration with Asia-Pacific countries. The CPTPP is projected to boost Canada’s GDP by $4.2 billion in the longer term (i.e. by 2040). This is significantly higher than the GDP gains of $3.4 billion that were projected under the TPP that included the United States. This increase in GDP is driven by increases in exports of goods and services, and by increases in investment.` - [link](https://www.international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/cptpp-ptpgp/impact-repercussions.aspx?lang=eng) - Economic impact of Canada’s participation in the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, 2018
    
### North American Free Trade Agreement
- The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was an agreement signed by Canada, Mexico, and the United States that created a trilateral trade bloc in North America.
- A 2001 Paper found that:
    
    - `U.S. real gross domestic product (GDP) fell slightly from 1990 to 1991, but grew steadily from 1992 onward, coinciding with the implementation of NAFTA` `The mainstream forecasts during the NAFTA debate were basically correct: NAFTA has had relatively small positive effects on the U.S. economy and relatively large positive effects on Mexico. ` - [link](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.15.1.125) - The Impact of NAFTA on the United States, Burfisher et al., 2001
    
- A 2017 Paper found that:
    
    - `It estimated that NAFTA likely increased annual U.S. GDP, but by a very small amount—“probably no more than a few billion dollars, or a few hundredths of a percent.”` - [link](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R42965.pdf) - The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Congressional Research Service and Villarreal, 2017
    
### United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement
- United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA) is a free trade agreement between Canada, Mexico, and the United States which replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
- In 2019, the U.S. International Trade Commission report found that:
    
    - `The Commission’s model estimates that USMCA would raise U.S. real GDP by $68.2 billion (0.35 percent) and U.S. employment by 176,000 jobs (0.12 percent). The model estimates that USMCA would likely have a positive impact on U.S. trade, both with USMCA partners and with the rest of the world. U.S. exports to Canada and Mexico would increase by $19.1 billion (5.9 percent) and $14.2 billion (6.7percent), respectively.` - [link](https://www.usitc.gov/publications/332/pub4889.pdf) - U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement: Likely Impact on the U.S. Economy and on Specific Industry Sectors, United States and International Trade Commission, 2019
    
## Student Debt Cancellation
- Bernie [**supports**](https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/23/politics/bernie-sanders-student-loan-debt-cancellation/index.html) cancelling **all $1.6 trillion** of student debt.
- Most of the debt is [**held by those**](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/10/09/who-owes-the-most-in-student-loans-new-data-from-the-fed/) in **upper-income levels**
    - Bailing out **all debt** would be [**net regressive.**](https://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/student-debt-forgiveness/)
- The **average college graduate** is still [**better off**](https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2015/more-education-still-means-more-pay-in-2014.htm) than the **average non-college graduate**.
    - This disparity is only [**rising.**](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2014/02/11/the-rising-cost-of-not-going-to-college/)
  
- A February 2018 research paper from the Levy Economics Institute of Bard College argues that government cancellation student debt in the United States would result in rising consumer demand, along with economic growth and increased employment. Over the following decade, the GDP would increase by between $86 billion and $108 billion annually, which would result in an increase of between 1.2 and 1.5 million jobs and a decreased unemployment rate of 0.22 to 0.36 percent. [[letscanceleveryo]]
- In January 2019, the Federal Reserve said that student loan debt has more than doubled in the last decade, and is forcing many in the millennial generation to delay buying homes. [link](https://www.npr.org/2019/02/01/689660957/heavy-student-loan-debt-forces-many-millennials-to-delay-buying-homes)
- A 2019 survey by Bankrate found that student loan debt is also forcing millennials to delay other financial and life milestones, such as building emergency savings, saving for retirement, or paying off other debts. [[suveryfindsmorepeople]]
- Beth Akers, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, points out that 66% of millennials have no college debt; most who do have debt proportional to their income; and that for those who drop out or fail to get a high-income job after getting an expensive degree, there are government programs that limit payments to a reasonable percentage of income and that forgive loans after 10-20 years if they cannot be repaid.

## Free College
- Bernie supports [**Free College**](https://berniesanders.com/issues/free-college-cancel-debt/), **which isn't necessarily bad**, but he supports it for every single person in the US.
- It forces taxpayers to **foot the bill for even wealthy students**, which [[somecollegeshavemorestudentsf]].
- It also **doesn't cover** [**living or textbook costs**](https://www.edmit.me/blog/how-much-does-the-average-college-student-spend-on-textbooks). This is **literally throwing money at the issue rather than solving it**.
- Bernie's funding plan for it **is very odd**, he said it would be funded by a [**Financial Transaction Tax**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_transaction_tax) and **that it would raise $2.4 trillion over ten years**. According to the [**Institute Of Taxation And Economic Policy**](https://itep.org/benefits-of-a-financial-transaction-tax/), it would **only raise $600 billion**, with the [**Tax Foundation**](https://taxfoundation.org/financial-transaction-tax/) saying **it would raise as low as $220 billion.**
## Student Financing
- Forgiveness
- Talk about the US forgiveness policy proposal
- Problems with that
- UK student finance system
- That plus government purchasing existing debt to funnel into a finance system,
- Final solution, Government purchases existing loan debts and implements income-scaled repayment plans, funnels pre existing debtors into the finance system.
- A 2017 paper found that `There are serious problems associated with the current design of US student loans, due largely to the difficulties many students face in repaying. After all, there are considerable risks associated with the process of acquiring a college degree, and substantial uncertainty related to the individual financial returns to higher education. Loan arrangements which don’t take these uncertainties into account, such as the system in place in the US, have great potential for creating adversity for borrowers. This paper draws lessons from Australia and England to suggest how this problem can be solved. The problem arises because with a conventional loan, with fixed monthly repayments, the duration of the loan and monthly repayments do not respond to changes in income, so that the ability to pay depends crucially on having sufficient income to make these loans affordable.` - [link](https://www.researchcghe.org/perch/resources/publications/wp16.pdf)
- A 2018 paper found that `The claim that increased student aid causes tuition to rise was originated by William Bennett, the secretary of education under Ronald Reagan, in a 1987 New York Times opinion piece. Numerous academic studies since have tested the Bennett hypothesis, and though a few have found some link between rising aid and tuition in at most one sector of higher education, the vast majority have “…found not a shred of evidence of an empirical relationship,” as David Warren wrote in the Washington Post. As Warren notes, three major federal reports in the last fifteen years have each surveyed the existing academic literature, and each concluded that no such relationship exists. The most recent, conducted by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in 2011, took advantage of a unique “natural experiment” to test the Bennett hypothesis: the substantial increases in Stafford Loan limits between 2007 and 2009.22 In 2007, the yearly loan limits, adjusted for inflation, ranged from $2,925 for freshmen to $6,125 for upper classmen. By 2009, they had risen to $5,750 and $7,825, respectively. All told, the yearly borrowing limit for all undergraduates increased by an average of $2,340. However, average tuition at public 4-year universities rose by just $540 over the same two years, in line with recent historical averages, leading the GAO to reject the possibility of a relationship between the two. Additionally, these increases in borrowing limits were the first since 1993, meaning that the inflation-adjusted value of the limit had declined for more than a decade during which tuitions rose steadily. All told, both the empirical evidence and academic consensus deem the Bennett hypothesis false.` - [link](https://www.demos.org/sites/default/files/publications/Robbie%20admin-bloat.pdf)
- A 2020 paper found that `While the distributional effects of student loan forgiveness are an important aspect of student loan forgiveness, other factors may play a role in determining the desirability of debt forgiveness. Student loans may distort career choices (Rothstein and Rouse, 2011), credit constraints may hinder entrepreneurship Barrios, Hochberg and Yi, 2020), debt overhang may distort labor supply decisions (Donaldson, Piacentino and Thakor, 2019) and debt relief may have macroeconomic consequences (Auclert et al., 2019).` - [link](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/BFI_WP_2020169.pdf)
## Rent Control
- Bernie [**supports Rent Control**](https://berniesanders.com/issues/housing-all/)
- Most economists [**agree that rent control is bad**](https://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/rent-control/).
- Rent control [**limits renters mobility by 20%, reduces housing supplies by 15%, and increasing the cost of rent by 7%**](https://web.stanford.edu/~diamondr/DMQ.pdf).

    - A 2016 paper found that `women are now better educated than men but they continue to lag (slightly) in actual labor market experience. In the full specification, the adjusted ratio (91.6 percent) remained considerably higher than in the human capital specification (82.1 percent) in 2011, suggesting a continued substantial role for occupation and industry in explaining the gender wage gap (recall that union differences have now been virtually eliminated).` ... `One puzzling finding in Table 4 is that, despite the occupational improvements of women shown in Table 3, gender differences in occupation accounted for a larger pay gap in 2010 than in 1980 (0.076 vs. 0.051 log points). However, while women upgraded their occupations during this period, the wage consequences of gender differences in occupations became larger as well.` - [link](https://docs.iza.org/dp9656.pdf)

- Right to work (RTW) laws directly increase occupational deaths, Methods Two-way fixed effects regression models are used to estimate the effect of unionisation on occupational mortality per 100 000 workers, controlling for state policy liberalism and workforce composition over the period 1992-2016. In the final specification, RTW laws are used as an instrument for unionisation to recover causal effects. Results The Local Average Treatment Effect of a 1% decline in unionisation attributable to RTW is about a 5% increase in the rate of occupational fatalities. In total, RTW laws have led to a 14.2% increase in occupational mortality through decreased unionisation. [link](https://oem.bmj.com/content/early/2018/06/13/oemed-2017-104747)

## Food Stamps
- A 2015 paper concluded that:
    
    - `SNAP effectively alleviates food insecurity in terms of caloric, macronutrient, and micronutrient intake. Still, SNAP participants are struggling more than income-eligible and higher-income nonparticipants to meet key dietary guidelines. Future policies should ensure that this vital food assistance program addresses diet quality while reducing food insecurity.` - [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1016/j.amepre.2015.04.035) - Dietary Quality of Americans by Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Participation Status: A Systematic Review, Andreyeva et al., 2015
    
- A 2015 report found that:
    
    - `We find that SNAP redemptions (the value of SNAP benefits redeemed by SNAP-authorized stores) had a positive average impact on county-level employment throughout the 2001 to 2014 period, with an increase of between 0.4 and 0.5 job per $10,000 of additional SNAP redemptions across all counties over the entire period.` `As expected, the impact of SNAP redemptions on employment was greater during the recession period (2008 to 2010) than either the pre-recession period (2001 to 2007) or the postrecession period (2011 to 2014) in both nonmetro and metro counties. In the recession period, SNAP redemptions contributed to about 1.0 job per $10,000 of additional SNAP redemptions in nonmetro counties and about 0.4 job per $10,000 of additional SNAP redemptions in metro counties.` - [link](https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/93169/err-263.pdf?v=1509.3) - The Impacts of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Redemptions on County-Level Employment, United States Department of Agriculture and Pender, 2019

    - `The SEBTC SNAP demonstration provided SNAP-like benefits in the summer to households <185% of the federal poverty limit with children receiving the school food programs during the school year.

- A 2016 paper concluded that:
    
    - `Majority of vendors from each market did believe that SNAP increased sales, but the percentage of increased sales is generally not higher than 5 percent. A potentially more crucial impact of the program is an increase in customer base, and fewer vendors in each market saw their customer base increase due to SNAP acceptance. Still, a majority of vendors did feel that the customer base has increased, that number could rise if the amount of promotional materials increased, drawing in new market customers.` - [link](https://scholarworks.uark.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1002&context=scwkuht) - Analysis of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Programs in Farmers' Markets, Thomas, 2016

## Money In Politics

- A 2003 Paper found that:
    
    - `Overall, PAC contributions show relatively few effects on voting behavior.

- A 2015 Paper concluded that:
    
    - `It is almost impossible to draw any conclusions from a body of scholarship that spans several fields.

- A 2017 Article found that:
    
    - `In examining the relationship between early fundraising and electoral success, this article suggests that focusing on general election contests understates the true effect of fundraising on election outcomes.

- A famous 2014 paper by Gilens & Page finds that:
    
    - `When the preferences of economic elites and the stands of organized interest groups are controlled for, the preferences of the average American appear to have only a minuscule, near-zero, statistically non-significant impact upon public policy.` - [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1017/s1537592714001595) - Testing Theories of American Politics: Elites, Interest Groups, and Average Citizens, Gilens and Page, 2014
    
- A replicated reply to the Gilens & Page paper found that when examining whether Republican and Democratic leadership were in support or opposed to this policy, rather than just examine policy adoption on its own, the conclusion differs:
    
    - `Given considerable research suggesting that public opinion can drive policy adoption...scholars have been surprised that rising economic inequality has not been associated with significant policy changes designed to redistribute income.` - [link](http://matthewg.org/Gilens-Parties4.pdf) - Oligarchy or Class War? Political Parties and Interest Groups in Unequal Public Influence on Policy Adoption, Grossmann and Isaac, 2017
    
- A 2017 reply to the Gilens & Page paper found:
    
    - `nonlinearities in the relationship between income and representation. Most dramatically, our analysis of the 2012 CCES showed that Republican representatives (though generally more responsive to higher income constituents) provided a much higher degree of representation to individuals in the 97th, 98th, and 99th percentiles. Second, our results revealed that individuals residing in Democratic districts received a fundamentally different mode of representation than those living in Republican districts. In Democratic districts, the relationship between income and representation was either negative (in the Catalist data) or generally flat with negative effects in the highest income categories (in the CCES data)` - [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1561/100.00016077) - Testing Models of Unequal Representation: Democratic Populists and Republican Oligarchs?, Rhodes and Schaffner, 2017

## Falling Rate of Profit
- A 1976 paper found that:
    
    - `The above very sketchy review of the literature on Marx's law of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall has shown us that-at present-no satisfactory formulation of this law exists.` - [link](https://sci-hub.st/https://www.jstor.org/stable/1817193?seq=1) - Marx and the Falling Rate of Profit, Christiansen, 1976
    
- A 2007 journal found that:
    
    - `A more realistic estimate of annual working hours is provided by Huberman (2002), who takes into account differences in weekly working hours, paid leave and public holidays. As Figure 3.1 shows, working hours in industrialized countries were reduced dramatically in the last century. In the Netherlands, for example, workers worked 3,285 hours per year in 1870 but only 1,347 hours in 2000. Interestingly, this reduction of working hours coincided with economic progress: the period of severe economic turbulence between 1929 and 1950 was accompanied by fluctuations in working hours, sometimes involving an upward trend. Other periods such as post-World War I and post-World War II are largely characterized by progressive reductions in working hours.` - [link](https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/@dgreports/@dcomm/@publ/documents/publication/wcms_104895.pdf) - Working Time Around the World, Messenger et al., 2007
    
- A 2014 paper found that:
    
    - `The examination of the determining factors of long-run profitability in the manufacturing sector has been largely neglected in the literature. Existing studies either overlook the internal profit dynamics of the sector for the sake of international developments or do not go beyond the application of descriptive statistics. Starting from the theoretical concepts of Marx-biased technical change and the tendential fall in the rate of profit, we intend to fill this gap with the use of multivariate cointegration analysis. A Vector Error Correction Model using a time-series dataset that covers the entire postwar era is applied to test the long-run relationship between the rate of profit and a set of variables. The analysis is extended to capital-intensive and labour-intensive industries within manufacturing. We find one true long-run relationship between the set of variables in all models. Capital intensity is found to have a negative impact on the profit rate in all models tested, providing evidence for Marx-biased technical change. The effect of real wages is also negative in the models where a statistically significant contribution is established. Labour productivity has the largest positive effect in all models and is promoted as the decisive counteracting force to the negative burdens on the rate of profit. A secular declining trend in the rate of profit cannot be confirmed.` - [link](http://lup.lub.lu.se/luur/download?func=downloadFile&recordOId=4648167&fileOId=4648170) - Technology, distribution, and long-run profit rate dynamics in the U.S. manufacturing sector, 1948-2011: evidence from a Vector Error Correction Model (VECM), Kalogerakos, 2014
    
- A 2018 paper found that:
    
    - `The results for this nonlinear approach reinforce previous empirical evidence that does not provide support for a systematic and declining tendency in profit rate as advanced in the Marxian literature.` `The model appears to provide a satisfactory portrayal of the evolution of the profit rate and the pattern of long swings reinforces previous rejections of the hypothesis of a consistent declining tendency of the profit rate.` - [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1080/13504851.2017.1352074) - Profit rate in the US, 1949–2007: a Markov switching assessment, Resende, 2018

## Boom Bust Cycle
- Crises have become less common over time and a higher proportion of countries in the world are growing at all times:
    
    - `The pandemic underscores the crucial value of global coordination and cooperation in public health as well as in economic policy. Cooperation across governments, and between governments, non-governmental organizations, and the private sector is necessary to help build domestic capacity to detect and respond to health crises, as well as develop and disseminate global public goods such as vaccines. Global coordination is vital for transferring health supplies and expertise where they are most needed in the near term, and to develop a coordinated exit strategy from restrictions on the free movement of people in the medium term. Moreover, the unprecedented common economic shock adds to the growing evidence of the gains from coordinating monetary and fiscal actions across countries (Bodenstein, Corsetti, and Guerrieri 2020; Triggs 2018). In late March, the G7 pledged to “do whatever is necessary to restore confidence and economic growth and to protect jobs, businesses, and the resilience of the financial system” (U.S. Department of the Treasury 2020).` - [link](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/33748/211553-Ch01.pdf?sequence=18&isAllowed=y) - Global Economic Prospects, 2020
    
- A 2001 Paper found that:
    
    - Output volatility has enormously fallen in the US and other high-income countries (G7) (minus Japan). They also found that higher inflation and higher inflation volatility both predict higher output volatility -- but the time trend predicts lower volatility `We have documented the long and large decline in output volatility over the last half-century.` - [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1353/eca.2001.0013) - The Long and Large Decline in U.S. Output Volatility, Blanchard and Simon, 2001
    
- A 2018 Paper found that there was no evidence for the post-2008 era having seen increased volatility.
    
    - `In this paper, we focused on break detection in mean and in variance on output growth for a set of advanced countries, based on statistical test procedures. It turns out that the Great Recession period is characterized by large breaks in mean of transitory nature, while dates of breaks in variance are consistent with the Great Moderation period in the eighties. This leads us to conclude that there is no evidence favoring an end of the low output volatility period, but rather that the Great Recession has a dramatically short-lived effect on the output growth but not on its volatility.` - [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1111/ecin.12551) - Does The Great Recession Imply The End Of The Great Moderation? International Evidence, Charles et al., 2018
    
- Good monetary policy is the claim to low volatility of capital in the US, namely The Great Moderation.
    
    - `The Great Moderation is the name given to the period of decreased macroeconomic volatility experienced in the United States from the mid-1980s to the financial crisis in 2007.` `The Great Moderation is seen as a part of the monetary policy framework laid by Paul Volcker and continued by Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke during their time as Federal Reserve chairs.` - [link](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/great-moderation.asp#:~:text=The%20Great%20Moderation%20is%20the,States%20starting%20in%20the%201980s.&text=The%20Great%20Moderation%20can%20be,inflation%20and%20positive%20economic%20growth.)

## Worker Co-Operatives
- Worker Co-operatives are used as an alternative firm structure that is totally owned and run by the workers of that firm.
- Mondragón - Mondragón is used as a common example of a worker co-operative that is successful in spain making the model stand strong against traditional firms but there's one problem, It’s worker-owned, it’s not totally worker managed making Mondragón by definition not a worker co-operative.
    
    - `Take the most advanced case: Mondragon. It’s worker-owned, it’s not worker managed, although the management does come from the workforce often, but it’s in a market system and they still exploit workers in South America, and they do things that are harmful to the society as a whole and they have no choice. If you’re in a system where you must make a profit in order to survive, you're compelled to ignore negative externalities, effects on others.` - Chomsky. [link](https://www.counterpunch.org/2012/04/30/talking-with-chomsky/)
    
- Mondragón has also become more traditional over time.
    
    - `Mondragón was set up with the ideals of worker participation, solidarity and equality, but as the business has grown bigger and bigger, and become more and more integrated into global capitalism, its founding principles have applied only to a shrinking percentage of its workforce. In 1993, Britain’s Guardian newspaper reported that Mondragón was restructuring to get ready to compete in the European single market. It noted that “increased salary differentials, advertising campaigns in Fortune and cooperative alliances with companies like Hotpoint have had many co–op workers wondering whether in the new Mondragón Cooperative Corporation [MCC] some members are more equal than others.”` - [link](https://isreview.org/issue/93/are-workers-cooperatives-alternative-capitalism)
    
- The problem with a partially or totally worker managed but not worker owned firm is that if you were to allow outside private investors, workers have a conflict of interest compared to shareholders, that conflict being labor cost and profit, as labor is a cost of business and affects the profit delivered to shareholders.
    
    - `The board of directors of a public company has a fiduciary responsibility for executive pay levels and programs. Accordingly, public companies have independent compensation committees to oversee executive pay decisions.` - [link](https://www.pwc.com/hu/hu/szolgaltatasok/konyvvizsgalat/szamviteli-tanacsadas/kiadvanyok/roadmap_for_an_ipo.pdf) - Roadmap for an IPO: A guide to going public, PwC, 2017
    
    - `The Commission may promulgate rules to provide that the standard of conduct for all brokers, dealers, and investment advisers, when providing personalized investment advice about securities to retail customers (and such other customers as the Commission may by rule provide), shall be to act in the best interest of the customer without regard to the financial or other interest of the broker, dealer, or investment adviser providing the advice.` - [link](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/COMPS-1878/pdf/COMPS-1878.pdf) - Investment Advisers Act Of 1940
    
- Workers that manage could vote to use that investment to bolster their own personal income, necessarily decreasing profits and then not delivering on that fiduciary responsibility that is required under federal agencies such as the SEC that firms have to deliver capital gains to its shareholders when the firm makes profit.
    
    - `Strict care must be taken to ensure no conflict of interest arises between the fiduciary and their principal.` In the case of a firm, the fiduciary being a CEO and the principal being the board of directors and in the case of a worker co-operative, the board of directors is the workers who manage. [link](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiduciary.asp)
    
    - `In accordance with such rules, any material conflicts of interest shall be disclosed and may be consented to by the customer.` - [link](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/COMPS-1878/pdf/COMPS-1878.pdf) - Investment Advisers Act Of 1940
    
- Also, if the federal agency has jurisdiction over the firm, then they are not entirely managed by workers. If there is no SEC-type agency, then there is no fiduciary responsibility. If there is no fiduciary responsibility, then there is no reason to invest. If there's no reason to invest, there's no company expansion.
- Marx argued that socialism in one country is impossible because a socialist revolution that does not spread will either be crushed from the outside or survive by being transformed from within. Socialism in one workplace is even more of a non-starter, because the economic, political, and military power of the existing ruling class remains in place.
    
    - `At the same time the experience of the period from 1848 to 1864 has proved beyond doubt that, however excellent in principle and however useful in practice, co-operative labor, if kept within the narrow circle of the casual efforts of private workmen, will never be able to arrest the growth in geometrical progression of monopoly, to free the masses, nor even to perceptibly lighten the burden of their miseries.` - [link](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1864/10/27.htm) - Inaugural Address of the International Working Men’s Association, Marx, 1864
    
- Because co-operative by themselves do not challenge the system and may divert energy away from doing so, Marx noted that a variety of establishment figures had become supporters of co-operative.
    
    - `It is perhaps for this very reason that plausible noblemen, philanthropic middle-class spouters, and even kept political economists have all at once turned nauseously complimentary to the very co-operative labor system they had vainly tried to nip in the bud by deriding it as the utopia of the dreamer, or stigmatizing it as the sacrilege of the socialist.` - [link](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1864/10/27.htm) - Inaugural Address of the International Working Men’s Association, Marx, 1864

## Labor Theory Of Value
- The Labor Theory of Value claims that Goods + Labor Inputs + Surplus Value = Value of the Commodity
- The Labor Theory of Value is defined by four different elements:
    - Abstract Labour: economically valuable work time
    - Concrete Labour: particular activity that has a specific useful effect.
    - Use Value: a commodities capacity to satisfy a human need.
    - Exchange Value: determines ratio which a commodity is exchangeable with every other commodity.
- Marx asserts that LTV only applies to the averages of various goods, not individual goods making this a self-admitted incomplete theory of value:
    
    - `But without the leave, and behind the back, of our weaver, the old-fashioned mode of weaving undergoes a change. The labour-time that yesterday was without doubt socially necessary to the production of a yard of linen, ceases to be so to-day, a fact which the owner of the money is only too eager to prove from the prices quoted by our friend s competitors. Unluckily for him, weavers are not few and far between. Lastly, suppose that every piece of linen in the market contains no more labour-time than is socially necessary. In spite of this, all these pieces taken as a whole, may have had superfluous labour-time spent upon them. If the market cannot stomach the whole quantity at the normal price of 2 shillings a yard, this proves that too great a portion of the total labour of the community has been expended in the form of weaving. The effect is the same as if each individual weaver had expended more labour-time upon his particular product than is socially necessary. Here we may say, with the German proverb: caught together, hung together. All the linen in the market counts but as one article of commerce, of which each piece is only an aliquot part. And as a matter of fact, the value also of each single yard is but the materialised form of the same definite and socially fixed quantity of homogeneous human labour.` - [link](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch03.htm) - Capital: a critique of political economy. Vol. 1, Marx, 1867
    
- In a journal called `Marxian Economics: A Reappraisal Essays On Volume III Of Capital - Volume 2: Profits, Prices And Dynamics`, In a section called `The Empirical Strength of the Labour Theory of Value`, Anwar Shaikh argues that the theory holds as proved by showing that total labor total times vs price of production correlates to each other. [link](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafykbzaceaccp5bzqpxfaxysdgcgzbgeau6k75iwtvq64qczstpu74i7lobsc?filename=%5B%5D+Riccardo+Bellofiore+%28eds.%29+-+Marxian+Economics%3A+A+Reappraisal%3A+Volume+2%3A+Essays+on+Volume+III+of+Capital+Profit%2C+Prices+and+Dynamics+%281998%2C+Palgrave+Macmillan%29+%5B10.1007%2F978-1-349-26121-5%5D.pdf) - Marxian Economics: A Reappraisal: Volume 2: Essays On Volume Iii Of Capital, Profits, Prices And Dynamics, Bellofiore, 1998
- Andrew Kliman argues that the problem with Shaikh's claim is that because `price of production` is represented through the input-output of an entire sector of an economy, it misses the value of a single product from said sector and doesn't factor the size of a given sector. So Kiman replicates the data:
    
    - `The measures of distance indicate that prices differed from adjusted values by an average of about +/-8% to +/-13%. Such results, and even somewhat weaker ones, are typically taken as providing strong confirmation that values are close to market prices. Yet what can we infer from this closeness and what can we not validly infer?` - [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1093/cje/26.3.299) - The law of value and laws of statistics: sectoral values and prices in the US economy, 1977—97, Kliman, 2002
    
- Kliman then adjusts the price and value of each sector by its aggregate labour and non-labour costs.
    
    - `I have chosen to deflate the sectoral aggregate prices and values by aggregate labour and non labour costs.` - [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1093/cje/26.3.299) - The law of value and laws of statistics: sectoral values and prices in the US economy, 1977–97
    
- Kliman then finds after adjustment, no correlation between labor input and value occurs
    
    - `Once the effects of industry size are removed, it is not the case that prices are high in high-value sectors and low in low-value sectors. Rather, size-adjusted prices and values are close only in the sense that almost all sectors prices are close to almost all sectors values. I thus find that, on average, a sector s value is no better a predictor of its price than is a random variable with the same probability distribution as the values.` - [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1093/cje/26.3.299) - The law of value and laws of statistics: sectoral values and prices in the US economy, 1977–97
    
- In their book `Capital is Power`, Jonathan Nitzan & Shimshon Bichler argue that Labor Theory of Value researchers assume wages equal the value of labor power (among other assumptions), which results in circular reasoning,
    
    - `The most important of these assumptions are that the value of labour power is proportionate to the actual wage rate, that the ratio of variable capital to surplus value is given by the price ratio of wages to profit, and occasionally also that the value of the depreciated constant capital is equal to a fraction of the capital’s money price. In other words, the researcher assumes precisely what the labour theory of value is supposed to demonstrate.` - [link](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/bafykbzacedvvf6kzqa35zvfvyix6otsy2yy53llgmxiukm5lzsqmpkfouzvbc?filename=Jonathan%20Nitzan%2C%20Shimshon%20Bichler%20-%20Capital%20as%20Power_%20A%20Study%20of%20Order%20and%20Creorder%20%28Ripe%20Series%20in%20Global%20Political%20Economy%29%20%282009%29.pdf) Capital as power: a study of order and creorder, Nitzan and Bichler, 2009
    
- Nitzan And Bichler then try to present an example demonstrating that, even when price and value are totally uncorrelated, aggregate price and value will be strongly correlated, demonstrating that this correlation is spurious.
    
    - `the average error you get when predicting United States prices using the labour theory of value is only about 9%. This has proven to be the case across many industries and several decades.` - [link](http://bnarchives.yorku.ca/308/2/20101200_cockshott_nitzan_bichler_testing_the_ltv_exchange_web.htm)
    
## Modern Monetary Theory
- MMT doesn't have a testable, falsifiable hypothesis that we can compare to neoclassical economics.
    
    - `ME/MMT is distinguished by its explicit recognition that the currency itself is a public monopoly, which is the micro foundation of fiat currency. MEMMT then builds the ramifications of that fundamental understanding.` - [link](http://www00.unibg.it/dati/corsi/910003/64338-Warren%20Mosler%20Bergamo%20paper%20March%2010.pdf)
    
- MMT claims that currency is a tax credit but doesn't explain the format of that tax credit, unlike conventional tax credits which are in dollars, which would make tax credits - currency - tax credits which is circular.
    
    - `ME/MMT recognizes that with fiat currency, the funds the government spends are best thought of as tax credits. Likewise, the funds the government spends that are not immediately used to pay taxes remain in the economy as ‘monetary savings’ until used to pay taxes in the future. Furthermore, these tax credits outstanding constitute what is called the ‘national debt’.` - [link](http://www00.unibg.it/dati/corsi/910003/64338-Warren%20Mosler%20Bergamo%20paper%20March%2010.pdf)
    
- MMT has also been explained by its founder very similarly to what the U.S. Federal Reserve already does, making it a subject within Keynesian Economics.
    
    - `MEMMT presumes the role of government is to establish and sustain public infrastructure for public purpose, and that the currency is a tool of government for the promotion of public purpose. Accordingly, what MEMMT offers are fiscal and monetary proposals that sustain employment opportunities for anyone willing and able to work, and that optimize real terms of trade, all in support of real standards of living.` - [link](http://www00.unibg.it/dati/corsi/910003/64338-Warren%20Mosler%20Bergamo%20paper%20March%2010.pdf)
    
- An IGM survey of a panel of 26 economists found that 0% agree with MMT in any degree of agreement. [link](https://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/modern-monetary-theory/)
- MMT has been tried in various Latin American countries and caused runaway inflation, huge currency devaluations, and precipitous real wage declines.
    
    - `Almost every one of the Latin American experiments with major central bank–financed fiscal expansions took place under populist regimes, and all of them ended up badly, with runaway inflation, huge currency devaluations, and precipitous real wage declines. In most of these episodes — Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Peru, and Venezuela — policymakers used arguments similar to those made by MMTers to justify extensive use of money creation to finance very large increases in public expenditures.` - [link](https://www.cato.org/cato-journal/fall-2019/modern-monetary-theory-cautionary-tales-latin-america)
    
- In a PBS interview with Paul Krugman on Modern Monetary Theory, he is asked about the claim of `The Government Cannot Go Bankrupt` made by MMTers and replies,
    
    - `Yeah, this is basically true, but you don't need a new theory for that, we kinda knew that already. To a large extent, they're just doing Keynesian Economics, but they don't know they're doing Keynesian Economics and they've invented their own terminology for it.` - [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gyj1H-gjI8)

### Notes
- Elinor Ostrom’s work on common pool resources show thoroughly that bottom-up approaches of consensus and agreement are what allow such approaches to work. While not explicitly socialist, her work does show people overcoming the tragedy of the commons (which is a common argument against socialism) for a long time, sometimes _hundreds_ of years.
- USSR was playing catch-up utilizing technology developed under capitalism. Growth rates tapered off as its industry matured. Failed to develop an internet because of infighting.
- Censorship of science under the USSR: most obvious fields that were suppressed were genetics, cybernetics and physics. USSR also censored photocopier which made communication difficult because they feared uprising
- Stafford Beer’s Cybersyn was built using cybernetic principles and rejected centralized planning so the system could be more adaptive
- 20th century `communist` regimes all failed miserably and at best, were little better than colonial capitalism. In their wake they left deeply reactionary societies and their ruling elites flipped to fascists almost overnight
- Nation-states’ military doctrines, often based on vertical command structure, are slow to respond to decentralised warfare by non-state actors
## Unemployment benefits
### US Unemployment Insurance
- A 2017 paper found that `This paper has taken advantage of a discontinuity in the Austrian UI system and identified a positive UI effect on re-employment wages. We argue that the magnitude of this UI wage effect is economically meaningful from both an individual and a social perspective. The magnitude of the effect is consistent with rational behavior of an agent who extends her unemployment by being more selective in her job search, knowing that this can help secure a lasting wage gain upon reemployment. Moreover, from a social perspective, the UI wage effect implies a considerable positive fiscal externality.` - [link](https://sci-hub.ee/10.1257/aer.20150528)
- A 2020 paper found that `We use LEHD data and find that match quality explains 35% of the increased wages due to more generous UI, while employer quality can explain almost 50% of the wage increase from UI. By contrast, we find that sorting is not much affected by more generous UI benefits. Consistent with both improved matches and employer quality, we find that extended UI benefit duration increases the likelihood of remaining in the job one year later, thus increasing job stability. In total, the increase in wages and the increase in job stability would imply an increase in earnings of $4,593 due to the increased generosity in UI benefit duration.` - [link](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w27574/w27574.pdf)

### European Union
- A 2011 paper found that `While the OLS analysis revealed the presence of a moderate correlation between social welfare spending and immigration from non-EU origins, the IV and GMM estimates indicate that the causal effect is smaller and statistically insignificant, thereby rejecting the welfare magnet hypothesis. All estimates for EU immigrants are essentially zero, which suggests that immigration within the EU does not respond to unemployment benefit incentives.` - [link](https://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&context=lew2012)
# Immigration Policy
## Trump's Wall
- A 2019 report found that:
    
    - `The number of Mexican immigrants living in the U.S. illegally has declined by 2 million since 2007. In 2017, 4.9 million unauthorized immigrants from Mexico lived in the U.S., down from a peak of 6.9 million in 2007.

## More Open Immigration
- A 2014 Cato institute paper asserts that most studies state the fiscal impact of immigration being negligible, and cites many ways that immigrants have had positive impacts on the economy, and predicts that future immigration should have no dramatic fiscal impact.

- Even illegal immigrants put into the system in unexpected ways, `Stephen Goss, the chief actuary of the Social Security Administration (SSA), told VICE News that an estimated 7 million people are currently working in the US illegally. Of those, he estimates that about 3.1 million are using fake or expired social security numbers, yet also paying automatic payroll taxes. Goss believes that these workers pay an annual net contribution of $12 billion to the Social Security Trust Fund.` - [link](https://news.vice.com/article/unauthorized-immigrants-paid-100-billion-into-social-security-over-last-decade)

- Nigerians are the most educated immigrant population in the United States. `Although they make up a tiny portion of the U.S. population, a whopping 17 percent of all Nigerians in this country held master's degrees while 4 percent had a doctorate, according to the 2006 American Community Survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau.` - [link](http://www.chron.com/news/article/Data-show-Nigerians-the-most-educated-in-the-U-S-1600808.php)
## Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals
- A 2016 study in the Journal of Public Economics found that DACA increased labor force participation and decreased the unemployment rate for DACA-eligible immigrants. DACA also increased the income of undocumented immigrants in the bottom of the income distribution. The study estimates that DACA moved 50,000 to 75,000 unauthorized immigrants into employment.

- According to University of California, Davis economist Giovanni Peri, DACA consequently:
    
    - `increases consumption and overall demand for U.S. services, products, and jobs where the DACA recipients live and spend. Economists have shown that highly skilled workers increase local productivity and create opportunities for the other workers too`. [link](http://econofact.org/the-economic-cost-of-repealing-daca)
    
- A 2016 study in Economics Letters found that DACA-eligible households were 38% less likely than non-eligible unauthorized immigrant households to live in poverty. [link](https://docs.iza.org/dp10145.pdf) - Can authorization reduce poverty among undocumented immigrants? Evidence from the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, Amuedo-Dorantes and Antman, 2016
- Furthermore, DACA-eligible workers tend to have higher-skilled, higher-paying jobs than undocumented immigrants. [link](http://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-daca-and-how-much-will-it-cost-the-us-2017-9)
- A 2018 National Bureau of Economic Research paper found that DACA likely led to greater productivity by increasing the college attendance and employment of DACA-eligible individuals.

- Peri argues that DACA recipients likely have a significant net positive fiscal impact given that DACA-eligible individuals have similar characteristics as second-generation immigrants, and that research shows that second-generation immigrants have a net positive fiscal impact of $173,000 to $259,000 per immigrant. Peri also notes that the U.S. public school system has already invested in educating these individuals, and they are at the point at which they can start contributing to the U.S. economy and public coffers; deporting them or increasing the likelihood that they are deported is economically counterproductive.

# Environmental Policy
## Climate Change
- In 2001 Following the publication of the IPCC Third Assessment Report, seventeen national science academies issued a joint statement, entitled `The Science of Climate Change`, explicitly acknowledging the IPCC position as representing the scientific consensus on climate change science. [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1126/science.292.5520.1261) - The Science of Climate Change, Science Mag, 2001
- In 2007 In preparation for the 33rd G8 summit, the Network of African Science Academies submitted a joint `statement on sustainability, energy efficiency, and climate change`: A consensus, based on current evidence, now exists within the global scientific community that human activities are the main source of climate change and that the burning of fossil fuels is largely responsible for driving this change. The IPCC should be congratulated for the contribution it has made to public understanding of the nexus that exists between energy, climate and sustainability. [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20231102014012/http://nasaconline.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Joint-Statement-by-NASAC-to-G8-on-Sustainability-Energy-efficiency-and-Cli.pdf) - Joint statement by the Network of African Science Academies (NASAC) to the G8 on sustainability, energy efficiency and climate change, Network of African Science Academies - 2007
- In 2009 In advance of the UNFCCC negotiations to be held in Copenhagen in December 2009, the national science academies of the G8+5 nations issued a joint statement declaring, `Climate change and sustainable energy supply are crucial challenges for the future of humanity. It is essential that world leaders agree on the emission reductions needed to combat negative consequences of anthropogenic climate change`. The statement references the IPCC's Fourth Assessment of 2007, and asserts that `climate change is happening even faster than previously estimated; global CO2 emissions since 2000 have been higher than even the highest predictions, Arctic sea ice has been melting at rates much faster than predicted, and the rise in the sea level has become more rapid`. The thirteen signatories were the same national science academies that issued the 2007 and 2008 joint statements.

## Fossil Fuels
- [EESI - Coleman and Dietz 19](https://www.eesi.org/papers/view/fact-sheet-fossil-fuel-subsidies-a-closer-look-at-tax-breaks-and-societal-costs#targetText=According%20to%20the%20IMF%2C%20%22fossil,by%203.8%20percent%20of%20GDP.%22)
- AIR AND LAND DESTRUCTION FROM FOSSIL FUELS
- Burning fossil fuels creates **air pollutants** such as:
    - particulate matter
    - carbon monoxide
    - sulfur dioxide
    - ozone
    - mercury
        - _(note: Coal-fired power plants are also the largest source of airborne mercury emissions in the United States. Mercury can move through the food chain and accumulate in the flesh of fish, posing the greatest risk to pregnant women)_
- These pollutants lead to **health impacts** including:
    - Asthma
    - lung disease
    - Bronchitis
    - and other chronic respiratory diseases that may lead to premature death
- Air pollutants from fossil fuels also contribute to:
    - the development of **lung cancers** as well as other cancers (30 percent of cancer-related deaths each year)
    - 200,000 **premature deaths** each year
- Fine particulate matter from U.S. coal plants (in 2010) resulted in:
    - 13,200 deaths
    - 9,700 hospitalizations
    - 20,000 **heart attacks**
- Extraction and refining of fossil fuel may result in a host of negative outcomes including:
    - landscape degradation
    - risk for spills
- **Coal extraction and burning involves**
    - **Strip mining** **(65% of production**
        - **(note: Involves clearing vegetation, soil, and rock above coal deposits, leading to permanent damage of landscapes and the creation of massive amounts of mine wastes)**
    - pollution across the supply chain
    - **coal ash deposits**
        - a combustion byproduct containing toxic heavy metals like arsenic, mercury, and chromium
        - one of the largest sources of industrial waste in the United States
        - 95 percent of coal ash storage sites have **contaminated groundwater** at levels deemed unsafe by the EPA
        - In the flooding that followed Hurricane Florence, several coal ash storage sites in North Carolina overflowed or were damaged, spilling contaminated water into surrounding area
## Nuclear Power
- [Kharecha and Hansen 13](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es3051197?source=cen)
- Global nuclear power has prevented:
    - **1.84 million deaths** related to air pollution
    - **64 gigatonnes of CO2 emissions** that would have resulted from fossil fuel burning
- On the basis of global projection data that take into account the effects of the Fukushima accident, nuclear power could, by midcentury, additionally prevent:
    - an average of **4.2 hundred thousand to 7.04 million deaths**
    - **80 to 240 gigatonnes CO2 emissions** due to fossil fuels
- [World Nuclear Association 19](https://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/current-and-future-generation/nuclear-power-in-the-world-today.aspx)
    - Nuclear energy now provides about **10% of the world's electricity** from about **450 power reactors**.
    - Over **50 countries** utilise nuclear energy in about 225 research reactors.
    - These reactors are used for the production of medical and industrial isotopes, as well as for training.
- [Center for Nuclear Science and Technology Information](http://nuclearconnect.org/know-nuclear/applications/energy) of the American Nuclear Society
    - Pollution prevented from being released into the atmosphere:
        - 5.1 million tons of sulfur dioxide
        - 2.4 million tons of nitrogen oxide
        - 164 million metric tons of carbon
    - Material Cost — one kg of Uranium is the approximate equivalent of:
        - 42 gallons of oil
        - 1 ton of coal
        - 17,000 cubic feet of natural gas
    - Monetary Cost:
        - Nuclear plants: 2.40 cents per kilowatt-hour
        - Coal-fired plants: 3.27 cents
        - Oil: 22.48 cents
        - Gas: 3.40 cents
    - Efficiency
        - Nuclear power plant capacity factors: over 85%.
        - Fossil fired plants: 50-60%
        - Solar and wind: 30% or lower
## Renewables
- [Stanford: Jacobson et al. 2015](http://web.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/CombiningRenew/CONUSGridIntegration.pdf) ([cited](https://www.ewg.org/energy/22422/100-percent-renewable-energy-us-possible-yes-0))
- **100 percent wind and solar power** could provide electricity to the continental U.S. more reliably than the current system by 2050, and at lower projected costs
    - This is in conjunction with energy efficiency, energy storage and other advances to complement renewables
- [Brown et al. 18](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032118303307) ([cited](https://www.ewg.org/energy/22422/100-percent-renewable-energy-us-possible-yes-0))
    - Analysis of a number of studies from around the world on the feasibility of 100% renewables.
    - In brief, the study includes explanations that:
        - There’s more than enough solar, wind and hydro potential – **30 times more** than business-as-usual forecasts for energy demand in 2050.
        - Technology already exists to **account for the variability** of wind and solar generation, so that the lights will stay on even when the weather doesn’t cooperate.
        - We do not need to alter the design of the electric grid radically to accommodate 100 percent renewables: The shift is well underway and accelerating.
        - **Costs won’t be overwhelming**. A grid based on 100 percent renewables can compete in cost with fossil fuel systems, even before factoring in the tremendous costs of pollution, global warming and water usage.
        - A number of nations and regions are at or close to 100 percent renewables already, including Denmark, Norway and parts of Germany. Canada is at 62 percent renewables and Brazil at 76 percent.
## Carbon Tax/Dividend
- A 2013 study found that:
    
    - `during the first 20 years alone, a CF&D policy would lead to: A 50% reduction of carbon emissions below 1990 levels, The addition of 2.8 million jobs above baseline, driven by the steady economic stimulus of the energy dividend, The avoidance of 230,000 premature deaths due to reduction in air pollutants that often accompany carbon emissions` - [link](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/remi-report/)
    
- A 2017 paper found that:
    
    - `in response to the BC carbon tax, employment declines in emission-intensive and trade-exposed industries while employment rises in clean service industries. The employment impacts differ across industries due to the difference in the output effect and redistribution effect of the tax. Employment falls in industries whose negative output effect outweighs their positive redistribution effect.` `The results from the preferred specification suggests that the BC carbon tax generated, on average, a small but statistically significant 0.74 percent (roughly 10,000 jobs) annual increases in employment over the 2007-2013 period, a 4.5 percent increase overall.` - [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1016/j.jeem.2017.03.003) - Jobs and climate policy: Evidence from British Columbia's revenue-neutral carbon tax, Yamazaki, 2017
    
- A 2018 paper found that:
    
    - `under plausible assumptions, the lowest household income quintile does not suffer an absolute reduction in welfare under the carbon tax. We also find larger source- and use-side impacts than what the narrower welfare measures used in previous studies would predict.` - [link](https://media.rff.org/documents/RFF20WP2018-22dc.pdf) - Impacts of a Carbon Tax across US Household Income Groups: What Are the Equity-Efficiency Trade-Offs?, Resources for the Future, 2018

## EPA
- EPA - A 2017 study found that the Clean Air Act of 1970 led to an over 10 percent reduction in pollution (`ambient TSP levels`) in counties that exceeded the pollution thresholds set by the Act in the three years after the regulation went into effect. The study found that this regulation-induced reduction in air pollution has caused affected workers to work more and earned one percent more in annual earnings. The authors estimate that cumulative lifetime income gain for each affected individual is approximately $4,300 in present value terms. [link](https://sci-hub.ee/10.1086/691465)
- A 2018 study found that the Clean Air Act contributed to the 60% decline in pollution emissions by the manufacturing industry between 1990 and 2008. [link](https://sci-hub.ee/10.1257/aer.20151272)

## Public Transport
- [link](https://www.vox.com/2021/3/10/22303355/gen-z-high-speed-rail-biden-map-meme-buttigieg)
- A 2012 paper found that
    
    - `The nine papers identified in this review report a range of 8–33 minutes of additional physical activity associated with public transport use, with several papers reporting 12–15 minutes. Using bootstrapping analyses, we found that if public transport use by inactive adults was to increase, there would be a significant dose-response increase in the population level of sufficiently active adults in NSW.` - [link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3407915/)
    
- A 2019 paper found that
    
    - `This systematic review found that initiating public transportation use was associated with modestly lower adiposity. Little evidence was available for other outcomes. Incorporating public transportation into sustainable urban design should be considered a potential mechanism for reducing overweight and obesity in the general population.` - [link](https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/188/4/785/5301286)
    
- A 2020 paper found that
    
    - `In this study, we find more positive than negative findings when excluding the null findings regarding the association between access to public transport and childhood obesity.` - [link](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/obr.12987)
