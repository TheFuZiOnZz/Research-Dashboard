## EPA
- EPA - A 2017 study found that the Clean Air Act of 1970 led to an over 10 percent reduction in pollution (`ambient TSP levels`) in counties that exceeded the pollution thresholds set by the Act in the three years after the regulation went into effect. The study found that this regulation-induced reduction in air pollution has caused affected workers to work more and earned one percent more in annual earnings. The authors estimate that cumulative lifetime income gain for each affected individual is approximately $4,300 in present value terms. [link](https://sci-hub.ee/10.1086/691465)
- A 2018 study found that the Clean Air Act contributed to the 60% decline in pollution emissions by the manufacturing industry between 1990 and 2008. [link](https://sci-hub.ee/10.1257/aer.20151272)

## Public Transport

- A 2012 paper found that
    
    - `The nine papers identified in this review report a range of 8–33 minutes of additional physical activity associated with public transport use, with several papers reporting 12–15 minutes. Using bootstrapping analyses, we found that if public transport use by inactive adults was to increase, there would be a significant dose-response increase in the population level of sufficiently active adults in NSW.` - [link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3407915/)
    
- A 2019 paper found that
    
    - `This systematic review found that initiating public transportation use was associated with modestly lower adiposity. Little evidence was available for other outcomes. Incorporating public transportation into sustainable urban design should be considered a potential mechanism for reducing overweight and obesity in the general population.` - [link](https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/188/4/785/5301286)
    
- A 2020 paper found that
    
    - `In this study, we find more positive than negative findings when excluding the null findings regarding the association between access to public transport and childhood obesity.` - [link](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/obr.12987)
