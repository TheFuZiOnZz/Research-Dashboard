## Modern Monetary Theory
- MMT doesn't have a testable, falsifiable hypothesis that we can compare to neoclassical economics.
    - `ME/MMT is distinguished by its explicit recognition that the currency itself is a public monopoly, which is the micro foundation of fiat currency. MEMMT then builds the ramifications of that fundamental understanding.` - [link](http://www00.unibg.it/dati/corsi/910003/64338-Warren%20Mosler%20Bergamo%20paper%20March%2010.pdf)
- MMT claims that currency is a tax credit but doesn't explain the format of that tax credit, unlike conventional tax credits which are in dollars, which would make tax credits - currency - tax credits which is circular.
    - `ME/MMT recognizes that with fiat currency, the funds the government spends are best thought of as tax credits. Likewise, the funds the government spends that are not immediately used to pay taxes remain in the economy as ‘monetary savings’ until used to pay taxes in the future. Furthermore, these tax credits outstanding constitute what is called the ‘national debt’.` - [link](http://www00.unibg.it/dati/corsi/910003/64338-Warren%20Mosler%20Bergamo%20paper%20March%2010.pdf)
- MMT has also been explained by its founder very similarly to what the U.S. Federal Reserve already does, making it a subject within Keynesian Economics.
    - `MEMMT presumes the role of government is to establish and sustain public infrastructure for public purpose, and that the currency is a tool of government for the promotion of public purpose. Accordingly, what MEMMT offers are fiscal and monetary proposals that sustain employment opportunities for anyone willing and able to work, and that optimize real terms of trade, all in support of real standards of living.` - [link](http://www00.unibg.it/dati/corsi/910003/64338-Warren%20Mosler%20Bergamo%20paper%20March%2010.pdf)    
- An IGM survey of a panel of 26 economists found that 0% agree with MMT in any degree of agreement. [link](https://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/modern-monetary-theory/)
- MMT has been tried in various Latin American countries and caused runaway inflation, huge currency devaluations, and precipitous real wage declines.
    - `Almost every one of the Latin American experiments with major central bank–financed fiscal expansions took place under populist regimes, and all of them ended up badly, with runaway inflation, huge currency devaluations, and precipitous real wage declines. In most of these episodes — Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Peru, and Venezuela — policymakers used arguments similar to those made by MMTers to justify extensive use of money creation to finance very large increases in public expenditures.` - [link](https://www.cato.org/cato-journal/fall-2019/modern-monetary-theory-cautionary-tales-latin-america)
    
- In a PBS interview with Paul Krugman on Modern Monetary Theory, he is asked about the claim of `The Government Cannot Go Bankrupt` made by MMTers and replies,
    
    - `Yeah, this is basically true, but you don't need a new theory for that, we kinda knew that already. To a large extent, they're just doing Keynesian Economics, but they don't know they're doing Keynesian Economics and they've invented their own terminology for it.` - [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gyj1H-gjI8)

### Notes
- Elinor Ostrom’s work on common pool resources show thoroughly that bottom-up approaches of consensus and agreement are what allow such approaches to work. While not explicitly socialist, her work does show people overcoming the tragedy of the commons (which is a common argument against socialism) for a long time, sometimes _hundreds_ of years.
- USSR was playing catch-up utilizing technology developed under capitalism. Growth rates tapered off as its industry matured. Failed to develop an internet because of infighting.
- Censorship of science under the USSR: most obvious fields that were suppressed were genetics, cybernetics and physics. USSR also censored photocopier which made communication difficult because they feared uprising
- Stafford Beer’s Cybersyn was built using cybernetic principles and rejected centralized planning so the system could be more adaptive
- 20th century `communist` regimes all failed miserably and at best, were little better than colonial capitalism. In their wake they left deeply reactionary societies and their ruling elites flipped to fascists almost overnight
- Nation-states’ military doctrines, often based on vertical command structure, are slow to respond to decentralised warfare by non-state actors
## Unemployment benefits
### US Unemployment Insurance
- A 2017 paper found that `This paper has taken advantage of a discontinuity in the Austrian UI system and identified a positive UI effect on re-employment wages. We argue that the magnitude of this UI wage effect is economically meaningful from both an individual and a social perspective. The magnitude of the effect is consistent with rational behavior of an agent who extends her unemployment by being more selective in her job search, knowing that this can help secure a lasting wage gain upon reemployment. Moreover, from a social perspective, the UI wage effect implies a considerable positive fiscal externality.` - [link](https://sci-hub.ee/10.1257/aer.20150528)
- A 2020 paper found that `We use LEHD data and find that match quality explains 35% of the increased wages due to more generous UI, while employer quality can explain almost 50% of the wage increase from UI. By contrast, we find that sorting is not much affected by more generous UI benefits. Consistent with both improved matches and employer quality, we find that extended UI benefit duration increases the likelihood of remaining in the job one year later, thus increasing job stability. In total, the increase in wages and the increase in job stability would imply an increase in earnings of $4,593 due to the increased generosity in UI benefit duration.` - [link](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w27574/w27574.pdf)
### UK Universal Credit & Jobseekers Allowance

### European Union
- A 2011 paper found that `While the OLS analysis revealed the presence of a moderate correlation between social welfare spending and immigration from non-EU origins, the IV and GMM estimates indicate that the causal effect is smaller and statistically insignificant, thereby rejecting the welfare magnet hypothesis. All estimates for EU immigrants are essentially zero, which suggests that immigration within the EU does not respond to unemployment benefit incentives.` - [link](https://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&context=lew2012)
# Immigration Policy
## Trump's Wall
- A 2019 report found that:
    
    - `The number of Mexican immigrants living in the U.S. illegally has declined by 2 million since 2007. In 2017, 4.9 million unauthorized immigrants from Mexico lived in the U.S., down from a peak of 6.9 million in 2007. Mexicans now make up fewer than half of the nation’s 10.5 million unauthorized immigrants (47% in 2017).` - [link](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/06/28/what-we-know-about-illegal-immigration-from-mexico/) - What we know about illegal immigration from Mexico, Pew Research Center and Krogstad, 2019

## More Open Immigration
- A 2014 Cato institute paper asserts that most studies state the fiscal impact of immigration being negligible, and cites many ways that immigrants have had positive impacts on the economy, and predicts that future immigration should have no dramatic fiscal impact. [link](https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/working-paper-21-fix.pdf) - The Fiscal Impact of Immigration, Nowrasteh, 2014
- A 2017 report by the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine asserts `Immigration's Long-Term Impacts on Overall Wages and Employment of Native-Born U.S. Workers Very Small, Although Low-Skilled Workers May Be Affected, New Report Finds; Impacts on Economic Growth Positive, While Effects on Government Budgets Mixed.` `When measured over a period of 10 years or more, the impact of immigration on the wages of native-born workers overall is very small.` `Immigration has an overall positive impact on long-run economic growth in the U.S.` - [link](https://www.nationalacademies.org/news/2016/09/new-report-assesses-the-economic-and-fiscal-consequences-of-immigration)
- Even illegal immigrants put into the system in unexpected ways, `Stephen Goss, the chief actuary of the Social Security Administration (SSA), told VICE News that an estimated 7 million people are currently working in the US illegally. Of those, he estimates that about 3.1 million are using fake or expired social security numbers, yet also paying automatic payroll taxes. Goss believes that these workers pay an annual net contribution of $12 billion to the Social Security Trust Fund.` - [link](https://news.vice.com/article/unauthorized-immigrants-paid-100-billion-into-social-security-over-last-decade)
- George Borjas, in the totality of his immigration studies, one of the most cited `anti-immigration` economists, asserts that immigration has a net wash impact on fiscal budgets. [link](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/09/trump-clinton-immigration-economy-unemployment-jobs-214216)
- According to a 2014 Report from the US Census, `The Foreign-Born Population From Africa: 2008–2012` black African immigrants in general have higher degrees compared to white people, with 41% of African immigrants having degrees compared to only 36% of native white people. The same report shows that 60.9% of Nigerians in the US have a Bachelor’s degree or higher.

## Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals
- A 2016 study in the Journal of Public Economics found that DACA increased labor force participation and decreased the unemployment rate for DACA-eligible immigrants. DACA also increased the income of undocumented immigrants in the bottom of the income distribution. The study estimates that DACA moved 50,000 to 75,000 unauthorized immigrants into employment. [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1016/j.jpubeco.2016.08.014) - The Effects of DACAmentation: The Impact of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals on Unauthorized Immigrants, Pope, 2016
- According to University of California, Davis economist Giovanni Peri, DACA consequently:
    
    - `increases consumption and overall demand for U.S. services, products, and jobs where the DACA recipients live and spend. Economists have shown that highly skilled workers increase local productivity and create opportunities for the other workers too`. [link](http://econofact.org/the-economic-cost-of-repealing-daca)
    
- A 2016 study in Economics Letters found that DACA-eligible households were 38% less likely than non-eligible unauthorized immigrant households to live in poverty. [link](https://docs.iza.org/dp10145.pdf) - Can authorization reduce poverty among undocumented immigrants? Evidence from the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, Amuedo-Dorantes and Antman, 2016

- A 2018 National Bureau of Economic Research paper found that DACA likely led to greater productivity by increasing the college attendance and employment of DACA-eligible individuals. [link](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/pol.20180352) - Do Human Capital Decisions Respond to the Returns to Education? Evidence from DACA, Kuka et al., 2020
- Peri argues that DACA recipients likely have a significant net positive fiscal impact given that DACA-eligible individuals have similar characteristics as second-generation immigrants, and that research shows that second-generation immigrants have a net positive fiscal impact of $173,000 to $259,000 per immigrant. Peri also notes that the U.S. public school system has already invested in educating these individuals, and they are at the point at which they can start contributing to the U.S. economy and public coffers; deporting them or increasing the likelihood that they are deported is economically counterproductive. [link](http://econofact.org/the-economic-cost-of-repealing-daca)

# Environmental Policy
## Climate Change
- In 2001 Following the publication of the IPCC Third Assessment Report, seventeen national science academies issued a joint statement, entitled `The Science of Climate Change`, explicitly acknowledging the IPCC position as representing the scientific consensus on climate change science. [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1126/science.292.5520.1261) - The Science of Climate Change, Science Mag, 2001
- In 2007 In preparation for the 33rd G8 summit, the Network of African Science Academies submitted a joint `statement on sustainability, energy efficiency, and climate change`: A consensus, based on current evidence, now exists within the global scientific community that human activities are the main source of climate change and that the burning of fossil fuels is largely responsible for driving this change. The IPCC should be congratulated for the contribution it has made to public understanding of the nexus that exists between energy, climate and sustainability. [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20231102014012/http://nasaconline.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Joint-Statement-by-NASAC-to-G8-on-Sustainability-Energy-efficiency-and-Cli.pdf) - Joint statement by the Network of African Science Academies (NASAC) to the G8 on sustainability, energy efficiency and climate change, Network of African Science Academies - 2007
- In 2009 In advance of the UNFCCC negotiations to be held in Copenhagen in December 2009, the national science academies of the G8+5 nations issued a joint statement declaring, `Climate change and sustainable energy supply are crucial challenges for the future of humanity. It is essential that world leaders agree on the emission reductions needed to combat negative consequences of anthropogenic climate change`. The statement references the IPCC's Fourth Assessment of 2007, and asserts that `climate change is happening even faster than previously estimated; global CO2 emissions since 2000 have been higher than even the highest predictions, Arctic sea ice has been melting at rates much faster than predicted, and the rise in the sea level has become more rapid`. The thirteen signatories were the same national science academies that issued the 2007 and 2008 joint statements.

## Fossil Fuels
- [EESI - Coleman and Dietz 19](https://www.eesi.org/papers/view/fact-sheet-fossil-fuel-subsidies-a-closer-look-at-tax-breaks-and-societal-costs#targetText=According%20to%20the%20IMF%2C%20%22fossil,by%203.8%20percent%20of%20GDP.%22)
- AIR AND LAND DESTRUCTION FROM FOSSIL FUELS
- Burning fossil fuels creates **air pollutants** such as:
    - particulate matter
    - carbon monoxide
    - sulfur dioxide
    - ozone
    - mercury
        - _(note: Coal-fired power plants are also the largest source of airborne mercury emissions in the United States. Mercury can move through the food chain and accumulate in the flesh of fish, posing the greatest risk to pregnant women)_
- These pollutants lead to **health impacts** including:
    - Asthma
    - lung disease
    - Bronchitis
    - and other chronic respiratory diseases that may lead to premature death
- Air pollutants from fossil fuels also contribute to:
    - the development of **lung cancers** as well as other cancers (30 percent of cancer-related deaths each year)
    - 200,000 **premature deaths** each year
- Fine particulate matter from U.S. coal plants (in 2010) resulted in:
    - 13,200 deaths
    - 9,700 hospitalizations
    - 20,000 **heart attacks**
- Extraction and refining of fossil fuel may result in a host of negative outcomes including:
    - landscape degradation
    - risk for spills
- **Coal extraction and burning involves**
    - **Strip mining** **(65% of production**
        - **(note: Involves clearing vegetation, soil, and rock above coal deposits, leading to permanent damage of landscapes and the creation of massive amounts of mine wastes)**
    - pollution across the supply chain
    - **coal ash deposits**
        - a combustion byproduct containing toxic heavy metals like arsenic, mercury, and chromium
        - one of the largest sources of industrial waste in the United States
        - 95 percent of coal ash storage sites have **contaminated groundwater** at levels deemed unsafe by the EPA
        - In the flooding that followed Hurricane Florence, several coal ash storage sites in North Carolina overflowed or were damaged, spilling contaminated water into surrounding area
## Nuclear Power
- [Kharecha and Hansen 13](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es3051197?source=cen)
- Global nuclear power has prevented:
    - **1.84 million deaths** related to air pollution
    - **64 gigatonnes of CO2 emissions** that would have resulted from fossil fuel burning
- On the basis of global projection data that take into account the effects of the Fukushima accident, nuclear power could, by midcentury, additionally prevent:
    - an average of **4.2 hundred thousand to 7.04 million deaths**
    - **80 to 240 gigatonnes CO2 emissions** due to fossil fuels
- [World Nuclear Association 19](https://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/current-and-future-generation/nuclear-power-in-the-world-today.aspx)
    - Nuclear energy now provides about **10% of the world's electricity** from about **450 power reactors**.
    - Over **50 countries** utilise nuclear energy in about 225 research reactors.
    - These reactors are used for the production of medical and industrial isotopes, as well as for training.
- [Center for Nuclear Science and Technology Information](http://nuclearconnect.org/know-nuclear/applications/energy) of the American Nuclear Society
    - Pollution prevented from being released into the atmosphere:
        - 5.1 million tons of sulfur dioxide
        - 2.4 million tons of nitrogen oxide
        - 164 million metric tons of carbon
    - Material Cost — one kg of Uranium is the approximate equivalent of:
        - 42 gallons of oil

## Renewables
- [Stanford: Jacobson et al. 2015](http://web.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/CombiningRenew/CONUSGridIntegration.pdf) ([cited](https://www.ewg.org/energy/22422/100-percent-renewable-energy-us-possible-yes-0))
- **100 percent wind and solar power** could provide electricity to the continental U.S. more reliably than the current system by 2050, and at lower projected costs
    - This is in conjunction with energy efficiency, energy storage and other advances to complement renewables
- [Brown et al. 18](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032118303307) ([cited](https://www.ewg.org/energy/22422/100-percent-renewable-energy-us-possible-yes-0))
    - Analysis of a number of studies from around the world on the feasibility of 100% renewables.
    - In brief, the study includes explanations that:
        - There’s more than enough solar, wind and hydro potential – **30 times more** than business-as-usual forecasts for energy demand in 2050.
        - Technology already exists to **account for the variability** of wind and solar generation, so that the lights will stay on even when the weather doesn’t cooperate.
        - We do not need to alter the design of the electric grid radically to accommodate 100 percent renewables: The shift is well underway and accelerating.
        - **Costs won’t be overwhelming**. A grid based on 100 percent renewables can compete in cost with fossil fuel systems, even before factoring in the tremendous costs of pollution, global warming and water usage.
        - A number of nations and regions are at or close to 100 percent renewables already, including Denmark, Norway and parts of Germany. Canada is at 62 percent renewables and Brazil at 76 percent.
## Carbon Tax/Dividend
- A 2013 study found that:
    
    - `during the first 20 years alone, a CF&D policy would lead to: A 50% reduction of carbon emissions below 1990 levels, The addition of 2.8 million jobs above baseline, driven by the steady economic stimulus of the energy dividend, The avoidance of 230,000 premature deaths due to reduction in air pollutants that often accompany carbon emissions` - [link](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/remi-report/)
    
- A 2017 paper found that:
    
    - `in response to the BC carbon tax, employment declines in emission-intensive and trade-exposed industries while employment rises in clean service industries. The employment impacts differ across industries due to the difference in the output effect and redistribution effect of the tax. Employment falls in industries whose negative output effect outweighs their positive redistribution effect.` `The results from the preferred specification suggests that the BC carbon tax generated, on average, a small but statistically significant 0.74 percent (roughly 10,000 jobs) annual increases in employment over the 2007-2013 period, a 4.5 percent increase overall.` - [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1016/j.jeem.2017.03.003) - Jobs and climate policy: Evidence from British Columbia's revenue-neutral carbon tax, Yamazaki, 2017
    
- A 2018 paper found that:
    
    - `under plausible assumptions, the lowest household income quintile does not suffer an absolute reduction in welfare under the carbon tax. We also find larger source- and use-side impacts than what the narrower welfare measures used in previous studies would predict.` - [link](https://media.rff.org/documents/RFF20WP2018-22dc.pdf) - Impacts of a Carbon Tax across US Household Income Groups: What Are the Equity-Efficiency Trade-Offs?, Resources for the Future, 2018

## EPA
- EPA - A 2017 study found that the Clean Air Act of 1970 led to an over 10 percent reduction in pollution (`ambient TSP levels`) in counties that exceeded the pollution thresholds set by the Act in the three years after the regulation went into effect. The study found that this regulation-induced reduction in air pollution has caused affected workers to work more and earned one percent more in annual earnings. The authors estimate that cumulative lifetime income gain for each affected individual is approximately $4,300 in present value terms. [link](https://sci-hub.ee/10.1086/691465)
- A 2018 study found that the Clean Air Act contributed to the 60% decline in pollution emissions by the manufacturing industry between 1990 and 2008. [link](https://sci-hub.ee/10.1257/aer.20151272)

## Public Transport
- [link](https://www.vox.com/2021/3/10/22303355/gen-z-high-speed-rail-biden-map-meme-buttigieg)
- A 2012 paper found that
    
    - `The nine papers identified in this review report a range of 8–33 minutes of additional physical activity associated with public transport use, with several papers reporting 12–15 minutes. Using bootstrapping analyses, we found that if public transport use by inactive adults was to increase, there would be a significant dose-response increase in the population level of sufficiently active adults in NSW.` - [link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3407915/)
    
- A 2019 paper found that
    
    - `This systematic review found that initiating public transportation use was associated with modestly lower adiposity. Little evidence was available for other outcomes. Incorporating public transportation into sustainable urban design should be considered a potential mechanism for reducing overweight and obesity in the general population.` - [link](https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/188/4/785/5301286)
    
- A 2020 paper found that
    
    - `In this study, we find more positive than negative findings when excluding the null findings regarding the association between access to public transport and childhood obesity.` - [link](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/obr.12987)
