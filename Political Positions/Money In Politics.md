## Money In Politics
- A 1994 paper found that:
    - `This paper finds that once district-specific factors and the quality of the competing candidates are controlled for, the impact of campaign spending on election outcomes, regardless of incumbency status, is small but positive.` - [Using Repeat Challengers to Estimate the Effect of Campaign Spending on Election Outcomes in the U.S. House, Levitt, 1994](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1086/261954)
- A 2003 Paper found that:
    - `Overall, PAC contributions show relatively few effects on voting behavior. In three out of four instances, campaign contributions had no statistically significant effects on legislation or had the `wrong` sign - suggesting that more contributions lead to less support` - [Why Is There so Little Money in U.S. Politics?, Ansolabehere et al., 2003](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1257/089533003321164976)
- A 2004 paper concluded that:
    - `The experiments suggest that incumbent spending has only a negligible effect on incumbent vote margins. In contrast, the challengerâ€™s spending appeared highly effective.` - [Does Campaign Spending Work?: Field Experiments Provide Evidence and Suggest New Theory, Gerber, 2004](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1177/0002764203260415)
- A 2015 Paper concluded that:
    - `It is almost impossible to draw any conclusions from a body of scholarship that spans several fields. It is notable, though, that regardless of the field, scholars have become increasingly focused on highly complex questions involving democratic representation, political equality, corruption, political influence, and governance. Not surprisingly, there is little consensus on these issues.` - [Campaign Finance and American Democracy, Dawood, 2015](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1146/annurev-polisci-010814-104523)
- A 2017 Article found that:
    - `In examining the relationship between early fundraising and electoral success, this article suggests that focusing on general election contests understates the true effect of fundraising on election outcomes. Fundraising matters a great deal to candidate selection. Success in the primaries is shown to be closely related to early fundraising outcomes. As the importance of primary elections has grown in recent decades, so too has the distortionary effect of early fundraising.` - [Professional Networks, Early Fundraising, and Electoral Success, Bonica, 2017](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1089/elj.2016.0413)
- A famous 2014 paper by Gilens & Page finds that:
    - `When the preferences of economic elites and the stands of organized interest groups are controlled for, the preferences of the average American appear to have only a minuscule, near-zero, statistically non-significant impact upon public policy.` - [Testing Theories of American Politics: Elites, Interest Groups, and Average Citizens, Gilens and Page, 2014](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1017/s1537592714001595)
- A replicated reply to the Gilens & Page paper found that when examining whether Republican and Democratic leadership were in support or opposed to this policy, rather than just examine policy adoption on its own, the conclusion differs:
    - `Given considerable research suggesting that public opinion can drive policy adoption...scholars have been surprised that rising economic inequality has not been associated with significant policy changes designed to redistribute income.` - [Oligarchy or Class War? Political Parties and Interest Groups in Unequal Public Influence on Policy Adoption, Grossmann and Isaac, 2017](http://matthewg.org/Gilens-Parties4.pdf)
- A 2017 reply to the Gilens & Page paper found:
    - `nonlinearities in the relationship between income and representation. Most dramatically, our analysis of the 2012 CCES showed that Republican representatives (though generally more responsive to higher income constituents) provided a much higher degree of representation to individuals in the 97th, 98th, and 99th percentiles. Second, our results revealed that individuals residing in Democratic districts received a fundamentally different mode of representation than those living in Republican districts. In Democratic districts, the relationship between income and representation was either negative (in the Catalist data) or generally flat with negative effects in the highest income categories (in the CCES data)` - [Testing Models of Unequal Representation: Democratic Populists and Republican Oligarchs?, Rhodes and Schaffner, 2017](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1561/100.00016077)
- A 2019 reply to the Gilens & Page paper found that:
    - `The larger the opinion supermajority, the more clear-cut the majoritarian position, the more likely the Democratic senators are to side with it and Republicans against it.` - [The Party or the Purse? Unequal Representation in the US Senate, Lax et al., 2019](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1017/S0003055419000315)
