### Medicare for All
#### Economic Analysis of Medicare for All, Pollin et al., 2018
- A 2018 paper by The Political Economy Research Institute identifies that in 2017 the US was spending $3.24 trillion on personal healthcare but other high income countries spend around 40% less and produce better healthcare outcomes. Medicare for all would reduce healthcare spending by nearly 10% to $2.93 trillion and create `stable access to good care for all US residents.`
- The study gives a good explanation regarding what medicare for all is and the goals:
	- `The primary goal of Medicare for All is to provide high-quality health care to all U.S. residents. This includes full coverage for the 8.8 percent of the population that is presently uninsured and the 26 percent of the population that is underinsured. Medicare for All also aims to provide stable access to decent coverage to all U.S. residents, including those who currently receive adequate care but may face difficulties at later points.` - [Economic Analysis of Medicare for All, Pollin et al., 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20230423162841/https://peri.umass.edu/publication/item/download/805_a3e545f40523864e46158aca8ebbb158)
    - `our results show that Medicare for All can promote both lower costs and greater equity in the financing of health care in the United States.` - [Economic Analysis of Medicare for All, Pollin et al., 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20230423162841/https://peri.umass.edu/publication/item/download/805_a3e545f40523864e46158aca8ebbb158)
- Among the main findings of the study are that other countries which have implemented some kind of universal healthcare generate better outcomes than the current system in the US.
    - `It is also the case that, on balance, other countries that provide universal health care generate superior health outcomes relative to the U.S. Another 2017 study summarizes some key evidence as follows: 'In other countries, a shift to universal health care has been associated with reduced mortality. Specifically, 34 countries score higher than the USA on the Health Access and Quality Index, a metric based on amenable mortality, or death that could be averted with medical care. All of these countries provide a form of universal care.'` - [Economic Analysis of Medicare for All, Pollin et al., 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20230423162841/https://peri.umass.edu/publication/item/download/805_a3e545f40523864e46158aca8ebbb158)
- In regard to the cost saving potential under medicare for all, the study identifies that:
	- `through implementation of Medicare for All, overall costs of providing full health care coverage to all U.S. residents could fall by about 19 percent in the first year of full operations relative to spending levels under the existing system.` - [Economic Analysis of Medicare for All, Pollin et al., 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20230423162841/https://peri.umass.edu/publication/item/download/805_a3e545f40523864e46158aca8ebbb158)
- The breakdown of the savings is as follows: 
	- `1) administration (9.0 percent savings in total system costs); 2) pharmaceutical pricing (5.9 percent savings in system costs); and 3) establishing uniform Medicare rates for hospitals, physicians, and clinics (2.8 percent savings in system costs).` - [Economic Analysis of Medicare for All, Pollin et al., 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20230423162841/https://peri.umass.edu/publication/item/download/805_a3e545f40523864e46158aca8ebbb158)
- This totals up to 17.7% savings and the other savings which would make this total add up to the aforementioned 19% would be achieved by addressing: 
	- `1) unnecessary services; 2) inefficiently delivered services; 3) missed prevention opportunities; and 4) fraud,` - [Economic Analysis of Medicare for All, Pollin et al., 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20230423162841/https://peri.umass.edu/publication/item/download/805_a3e545f40523864e46158aca8ebbb158)
- The study identifies two sources which could/would be sourced to finance medicare for all: current revenue sources and a multitude of other sources. Current revenue sources account for $1.88 trillion, meaning the extra ~$1.05 trillion (the study assumes $1.08 trillion for the purposes of analysis) would need to come from other sources the study identifies like cutting business healthcare premiums by 8% relative to existing spending per worker, a 3.75% sales tax on non-necessities, a net worth tax of 0.38%, and taxing long-term capital gains as ordinary income (see page 9 of the study for more in-depth analysis).
    - `The first is the same public health care revenue sources that presently provide about 60 percent of all U.S. health care financing. These include Medicare and Medicaid, which together finance nearly 40 percent of all health care funding. It also includes tax subsidies for health care expenditures by individuals and households, which equal about 10 percent of total funding.` - [Economic Analysis of Medicare for All, Pollin et al., 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20230423162841/https://peri.umass.edu/publication/item/download/805_a3e545f40523864e46158aca8ebbb158)
    - `There are multiple ways through which the U.S. federal government could raise $1.08 trillion in additional revenues to finance Medicare for All. We examine here one set of new measures that would be capable of generating a total of $1.08 trillion in an equitable and efficient matter. But we emphasize that additional approaches could also be workable.` - [Economic Analysis of Medicare for All, Pollin et al., 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20230423162841/https://peri.umass.edu/publication/item/download/805_a3e545f40523864e46158aca8ebbb158)
- When looking at the impact on families, low and middle income families would see their healthcare spending reduced by anywhere from 0.8% to 14% (Figure 2).
- On a macroeconomics level, the study reports that, over a 10 year period in which healthcare is 15.8% of America's GDP (as opposed to 17.2% as it is now), implementing medicare for all would raise productivity thanks to improved health outcomes, support greater income equality, and support job creation (see page 16 of the study for further analysis).
#### Does Medicare Coverage Improve Cancer Detection and Mortality Outcomes?, Myerson et al., 2020
- A 2020 paper in The Journal of Policy Analysis and Management found that:
    - `We reviewed 90 studies and included primary analyses of 22 single-payer plans from 18 studies, published between 1991 and 2018, including 8 national and 14 state-level plans` - [Does Medicare Coverage Improve Cancer Detection and Mortality Outcomes?, Myerson et al., 2020](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/pam.22199)
- the authors of this research concluded that:
    - `We found that 19 (86%) of the analyses predicted net savings (median net result was a savings of 3.46% of total costs) in the first year of program operation and 20 (91%) predicted savings over several years; anticipated growth rates would result in long-term net savings for all plans.` - [Does Medicare Coverage Improve Cancer Detection and Mortality Outcomes?, Myerson et al., 2020](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/pam.22199)
    - `All studies estimate lower costs due to simplified payment administration, but vary in the size of these savings` `In the long term, projected net savings increase, due to a more tightly controlled rate of growth.` - [Does Medicare Coverage Improve Cancer Detection and Mortality Outcomes?, Myerson et al., 2020](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/pam.22199)
- The study reviewed 22 different, credible, economic models of single-payer financing in the US and found that:
    - `19 (86%) predict net savings in the first year of operations, with a range from 7% higher net cost to 15% lower net cost.` - [Does Medicare Coverage Improve Cancer Detection and Mortality Outcomes?, Myerson et al., 2020](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/pam.22199)
    - `The largest net savings were for plans with reductions in drug costs. Net savings accumulate over time at an estimated 1.4% per year.` - [Does Medicare Coverage Improve Cancer Detection and Mortality Outcomes?, Myerson et al., 2020](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/pam.22199)
- Overall:
    - `These analyses suggest that single-payer can save money, even in year 1, incorporating a wide range of assumptions about potential savings.` - [Does Medicare Coverage Improve Cancer Detection and Mortality Outcomes?, Myerson et al., 2020](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/pam.22199)
- The research concludes:
    - `In this systematic review, we found a high degree of analytic consensus for the fiscal feasibility of a single-payer approach in the US.` - [Does Medicare Coverage Improve Cancer Detection and Mortality Outcomes?, Myerson et al., 2020](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/pam.22199)
    - `There is near-consensus in these analyses that single-payer would reduce health expenditures while providing high-quality insurance to all US residents. To achieve net savings, single-payer plans rely on simplified billing and negotiated drug price reductions, as well as global budgets to control spending growth over time. Replacing private insurers with a public system is expected to achieve lower net healthcare costs.` - [Does Medicare Coverage Improve Cancer Detection and Mortality Outcomes?, Myerson et al., 2020](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/pam.22199)
### Medicaid
- A 2017 Paper found that:
    - `..that the cohorts covered by Medicaid as young children in the 1960s and 1970s, grow up to be healthier adults who work more and receive public assistance less often.` `Improvements in longevity and morbidity are worth over one trillion dollars, and the labor supply and program participation effects save the government about $36 billion per year.` - [The Long-Run Effects of Childhood Insurance Coverage: Medicaid Implementation, Adult Health, and Labor Market Outcomes, Goodman-Bacon, 2017](https://cdn.vanderbilt.edu/vu-my/wp-content/uploads/sites/2318/2019/04/14141045/medicaid_longrun_ajgb.pdf)
### Affordable Care Act
- A 2015 report found that:
    - `most market fundamentals have stayed consistent with prior trends, suggesting that the implementation has not caused significant disruption for most market participants. Premiums for single and family coverage increased by 4% in 2015, continuing a fairly long period (2005 to 2015) where annual premium growth has averaged about 5%. The percentage of employers offering coverage (57%) is similar to recent years, as is the percentage of workers in offering firms covered by their own employer (63%).` - [Employer Health Benefits 2015 Summary of Findings, The Kaiser Family Foundation and The Health Research & Educational Trust, 2015](https://files.kff.org/attachment/summary-of-findings-2015-employer-health-benefits-survey)
- A 2016 report found that:
    - `In most parts of the country in 2016, a 40-year-old adult making $30,000 per year would pay about $208 per month for the second-lowest-silver plan. If this person is willing to switch to whatever the new second lowest-cost silver plan is in 2017, they will pay a similar amount (the after-tax credit payment for a similar person in 2017 is $207 per month or a change of 0%).` - [2017 Premium Changes and Insurer Participation in the Affordable Care Act’s Health Insurance Marketplaces, The Kaiser Family Foundation, 2016](https://www.kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/2017-premium-changes-and-insurer-participation-in-the-affordable-care-acts-health-insurance-marketplaces/)
- A 2016 CDC report found that:
    - `an average of about 12 million people will be covered by insurance purchased through the (ACA) marketplaces.` `CBO and JCT expect average enrollment to continue to increase to 15 million people in 2017 and then to between 18 million and 19 million people each year from 2018 to 2026. Between 80 percent and 85 percent of those enrollees—or about 14 million to 16 million people—are expected to receive subsidies for purchasing that insurance each year after 2017.` - [Federal Subsidies for Health Insurance Coverage for People Under Age 65: 2016 to 2026, Congressional Budget Office, 2016](https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/114th-congress-2015-2016/reports/51385-healthinsurancebaselineonecol.pdf)
- A 2016 data sheet found that in 2013, the U.S. had 44.8 million people uninsured, In 2014, the U.S. had 36.0 million people uninsured, In 2015, the U.S. had 28.6 million people uninsured.

### Affordable Care Act Under Trump
- A 2017 paper found that:
    - `In its first two years of full implementation, the ACA improved health care access for Americans in low-income households, people who were not college graduates, and the unemployed. The law’s Medicaid expansion was responsible for about half of these gains. The ACA was associated with a substantial (but incomplete) narrowing of socioeconomic disparities in access, particularly in states that expanded Medicaid.` - [The Affordable Care Act Reduced Socioeconomic Disparities In Health Care Access, Griffith et al., 2017](https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/pdf/10.1377/hlthaff.2017.0083)
- A 2017 paper found that:
    - `In 2026, an estimated 52 million people would be uninsured, compared with 28 million who would lack insurance that year under current law.` `In 2018 and 2019, according to CBO and JCT’s estimates, average premiums for single policyholders in the nongroup market would be 15 percent to 20 percent higher than under current law, mainly because the individual mandate penalties would be eliminated, inducing fewer comparatively healthy people to sign up.` - [American Health Care Act, Congressional Budget Office, 2017](https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/115th-congress-2017-2018/costestimate/americanhealthcareact.pdf)
- A 2019 paper found that In 2016, the U.S. had 27.5 million people uninsured. In 2017, the U.S. had 28.3 million people uninsured. In 2018, the U.S. had 28.9 million people uninsured.
