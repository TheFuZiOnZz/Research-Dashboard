# Problems
- A 2009 paper found that:
    - `On average, guns did not protect those who possessed them from being shot in an assault. Although successful defensive gun uses occur each year, the probability of success may be low for civilian gun users in urban areas. Such users should reconsider their possession of guns or, at least, understand that regular possession necessitates careful safety countermeasures.` - [Investigating the Link Between Gun Possession and Gun Assault, Branas et al., 2009](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.2105/AJPH.2008.143099)
- A 2014 meta-analysis found that:
    - `In summary, we found the association between firearm availability and homicide to be more modest than that between firearm availability and completed suicide. The evidence that we synthesize here helps to elucidate the risks of having a firearm in the home; restricting that access may effectively prevent injury` - [The Accessibility of Firearms and Risk for Suicide and Homicide Victimization Among Household Members: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis, Anglemyer et al., 2014](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/suppl/10.7326/M13-1301/suppl_file/AIME201401210-00006-v1.pdf)
- A 2015 paper found that:
    - `Of over 14,000 incidents in which the victim was present, 127 (0.9%) involved a SDGU. SDGU was more common among males, in rural areas, away from home, against male offenders and against offenders with a gun. After any protective action, 4.2% of victims were injured; after SDGU, 4.1% of victims were injured. In property crimes, 55.9% of victims who took protective action lost property, 38.5 of SDGU victims lost property, and 34.9% of victims who used a weapon other than a gun lost property.` - [The epidemiology of self-defense gun use: evidence from the National Crime Victimization Surveys 2007-2011, Hemenway and Solnick, 2015](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1016/j.ypmed.2015.03.029)
- A 2019 paper found that:
    - `The best available evidence using different statistical approaches—panel data regression and synthetic control—with varying strengths and shortcomings and with different model specifications all suggest that the net effect of state adoption of RTC laws is a substantial increase in violent crime. (13-15% higher violent crime)` - [Right-to-Carry Laws and Violent Crime: A Comprehensive Assessment Using Panel Data and a State-Level Synthetic Control Analysis, Donohue et al., 2019](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1111/jels.12219)
- A 2019 paper found that:
    - `This study finds that the rich–poor gap, citizens’ levels of trust in institutions, economic opportunity, and public welfare spending are associated with rates of firearm-related homicides in the US. Further elucidating and modifying the social and economic drivers of firearm related homicides and mass shootings—possibly through candidate levers including taxation policies and policies that increase college affordability—are essential if the US as a nation is to effectively address the epidemic of gun homicides, and reverse recent trends in life expectancy among Americans.` - [Social determinants of health in relation to firearm-related homicides in the United States: A nationwide multilevel cross-sectional study, Kim, 2019](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1371/journal.pmed.1002978)
# Solution
## Universal Background Checks
- A 2017 paper found that:
    - `Half of our respondents acquired their most recent gun within the past 5 years (29% within the past 2 years, 21% between 2 and 5 years ago, and the remainder more than 5 years ago). For gun owners who reported acquiring their last firearm within 2 years of the April survey, 22% obtained their most recent gun without a background check` - [Firearm Acquisition Without Background Checks: Results of a National Survey, Miller et al., 2017](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.7326/M16-1590?url_ver=Z39.88-2003)
- A 2020 paper found that:
    - `Universal background checks were associated with 13% lower firearm homicide rates in large cities` `Permit requirements were associated with 21% lower firearm homicide rates in large cities and 20% lower firearm homicide rates in smaller localities.` - [The Impact of State Firearm Laws on Homicide Rates in Suburban and Rural Areas Compared to Large Cities in the United States, 1991-2016, Siegel et al., 2020](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1111/jrh.12387)
## Gun Buyback Programs
- A 2010 paper found that:
    - `The results in this paper—using a different and more reliable source of identification—support the general findings of those time series studies. We show that the largest falls in firearm deaths occurred in states where more firearms were bought back. Compared to time series studies, this approach has some key benefits. First, it allows us to control for national-level trends in death rates through the use of national-level fixed effects and at the state level through state-specific time trends—the results show that, even after controlling for such trends, there was a statistically significant decline in firearm deaths in states with higher firearm buyback rates. Second, we are able to examine in more depth the time pattern of any response of deaths to the NFA—the results show that firearm deaths in states with higher buyback rates fell relative to those with lower buyback rates and that this relative reduction in the firearm death rate was maintained subsequently. Finally, we use an instrumental variables strategy to allow for possible endogeneity in the gun buyback rate and find that this makes no substantive difference to the results. That the results in the baseline regression are robust to all three approaches suggests that the relationship between buyback rates and death rates is likely causal.` - [Do Gun Buybacks Save Lives? Evidence from Panel Data, Leigh and Neill, 2010](http://andrewleigh.org/pdf/GunBuyback_Panel.pdf)
## Gun Permits
- A 2015 paper found that:
    - `The synthetic control model estimated a 15.4% reduction in firearm suicide rates associated with Connecticut's PTP law. Missouri's PTP law repeal was associated with a 16.1% increase in firearm suicide rates. Evidence that PTP laws were associated with non-firearm suicide rates was mixed in Connecticut and negative in Missouri.` - [Effects of changes in permit-to-purchase handgun laws in Connecticut and Missouri on suicide rates, Crifasi et al., 2015](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1016/j.ypmed.2015.07.013)
- A 2020 paper found that:
    - `Permit requirements were associated with 21% lower firearm homicide rates (95% CI: 14%-28%) in large cities and 20% lower firearm homicide rates (95% CI: 7%-31%) in smaller localities.` - [The Impact of State Firearm Laws on Homicide Rates in Suburban and Rural Areas Compared to Large Cities in the United States, 1991-2016, Siegel et al., 2020](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1111/jrh.12387)
## Waiting Periods
- A 2017 paper found that:
    - `The results of Table 1 show that waiting periods are associated with a 17% reduction in gun homicides. This effect is equivalent to ∼36 fewer gun homicides per year for a state with an average number of gun deaths. Waiting periods also lead to a 7–11% reduction in gun suicides (depending on the control variables used in the specification), which is equivalent to 22–35 fewer gun suicides per year for the average state.` - [Handgun waiting periods reduce gun deaths, Luca et al., 2017](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1073/pnas.1619896114)
