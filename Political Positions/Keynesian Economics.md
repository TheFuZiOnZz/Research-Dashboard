## Keynesian Economics
### Deficit Spending
- Deficit Spending is when a government's expenditures exceed its revenues during a fiscal period, causing it to run a budget deficit. The phrase `deficit spending` often implies a Keynesian approach to economic stimulus, in which the government takes on debt while using its spending power to create demand and stimulate the economy.

### Post-Keynesian Economics
- Of the various schools within Political Economy, post-Keynesian economics is arguably one of the more extensive and coherent schools, whose ideas can be found in many thinkers.

- As a side note, within my Political Economy folder, you will find a sub-folder titled “[Post-Keynesian Theory](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IlURrVqutHhotbJlVurOnc0fQF9scOSq)”, which contains a few books within the post-Keynesian school. I strongly recommend checking out the “Essential PKE” folder because this folder contains introductory post-Keynesian material.
### Keynes’s General Theory
