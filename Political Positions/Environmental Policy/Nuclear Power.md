- Global nuclear power has prevented:
    - **1.84 million deaths** related to air pollution
    - **64 gigatonnes of CO2 emissions** that would have resulted from fossil fuel burning
- On the basis of global projection data that take into account the effects of the Fukushima accident, nuclear power could, by midcentury, additionally prevent:
    - an average of **4.2 hundred thousand to 7.04 million deaths**
    - **80 to 240 gigatonnes CO2 emissions** due to fossil fuels

    - Nuclear energy now provides about **10% of the world's electricity** from about **450 power reactors**.
    - Over **50 countries** utilise nuclear energy in about 225 research reactors.
    - These reactors are used for the production of medical and industrial isotopes, as well as for training.

    - Pollution prevented from being released into the atmosphere:
        - 5.1 million tons of sulfur dioxide
        - 2.4 million tons of nitrogen oxide
        - 164 million metric tons of carbon
    - Material Cost â€” one kg of Uranium is the approximate equivalent of:
        - 42 gallons of oil
        - 1 ton of coal
        - 17,000 cubic feet of natural gas
    - Monetary Cost:
        - Nuclear plants: 2.40 cents per kilowatt-hour
        - Coal-fired plants: 3.27 cents
        - Oil: 22.48 cents
        - Gas: 3.40 cents
    - Efficiency
        - Nuclear power plant capacity factors: over 85%.
        - Fossil fired plants: 50-60%
        - Solar and wind: 30% or lower
