- AIR AND LAND DESTRUCTION FROM FOSSIL FUELS
- Burning fossil fuels creates **air pollutants** such as:
    - particulate matter
    - carbon monoxide
    - sulfur dioxide
    - ozone
    - mercury
        - _(note: Coal-fired power plants are also the largest source of airborne mercury emissions in the United States. Mercury can move through the food chain and accumulate in the flesh of fish, posing the greatest risk to pregnant women)_
- These pollutants lead to **health impacts** including:
    - Asthma
    - lung disease
    - Bronchitis
    - and other chronic respiratory diseases that may lead to premature death
- Air pollutants from fossil fuels also contribute to:
    - the development of **lung cancers** as well as other cancers (30 percent of cancer-related deaths each year)
    - 200,000 **premature deaths** each year
- Fine particulate matter from U.S. coal plants (in 2010) resulted in:
    - 13,200 deaths
    - 9,700 hospitalizations
    - 20,000 **heart attacks**
- Extraction and refining of fossil fuel may result in a host of negative outcomes including:
    - landscape degradation
    - risk for spills
- **Coal extraction and burning involves**
    - **Strip mining** **(65% of production**
        - **(note: Involves clearing vegetation, soil, and rock above coal deposits, leading to permanent damage of landscapes and the creation of massive amounts of mine wastes)**
    - pollution across the supply chain
    - **coal ash deposits**
        - a combustion byproduct containing toxic heavy metals like arsenic, mercury, and chromium
        - one of the largest sources of industrial waste in the United States
        - 95 percent of coal ash storage sites have **contaminated groundwater** at levels deemed unsafe by the EPA
        - In the flooding that followed Hurricane Florence, several coal ash storage sites in North Carolina overflowed or were damaged, spilling contaminated water into surrounding area
