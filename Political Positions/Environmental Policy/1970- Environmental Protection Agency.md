- EPA - A 2017 study found that the Clean Air Act of 1970 led to an over 10 percent reduction in pollution (`ambient TSP levels`) in counties that exceeded the pollution thresholds set by the Act in the three years after the regulation went into effect. The study found that this regulation-induced reduction in air pollution has caused affected workers to work more and earned one percent more in annual earnings. The authors estimate that cumulative lifetime income gain for each affected individual is approximately $4,300 in present value terms. [link](https://sci-hub.ee/10.1086/691465)
