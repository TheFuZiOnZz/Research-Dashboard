## Western Imperialism of Trade
- A 2015 paper found that:
    - `Two main findings emerge from this analysis. First, at its peak in 1996, trade from territories designated under the Basel Convention as Annex VII [composed of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the European Community (EC) and Lichtenstein] to non-Annex VII territories (all other signatories) accounted for just over 35% of total trade. By 2012 trade from Annex VII to non-Annex VII territories accounted for less than 1% of total trade. Second, between 1996 and 2012 the two groups of territories evolved different regional trade orientations: Annex VII territories are predominantly trading intra-regionally, with 73–82% of total trade moving between Annex VII territories.` - [The changing geography of global trade in electronic discards: time to rethink the e‐waste problem, Lepawsky, 2015](https://sci-hub.ee/10.1111/geoj.12077)
- A 2018 paper found that:
    - `The share of US expenditure on imports is smaller than in most other countries`
    - `Although magnitudes vary greatly depending on how one infers the shape of the US demand for foreign factor services, the estimates of gains from trade for the US economy that we review range from 2 to 8 percent of GDP. Although such gains are nothing to spit at, they may appear surprisingly small to some. It may be the case that if the United States were to approach autarky, the US demand for foreign factor services would become much less elastic, revealing the importance of some critical foreign inputs and, in turn, much larger gains from trade.` - [The US Gains From Trade: Valuation Using the Demand for Foreign Factor Services, Costinot and Rodríguez-Clare, 2018](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.32.2.3)

- What did Marx actually argue in volume 1 of Capital, [link](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/download/pdf/Capital-Volume-I.pdf) The essence of Marx’s theory and his conception of the historical tendency of capitalism is as follows:
    - (1) Marx had an elaborate labour theory of value on which he founded volume 1 of Capital. Marx understood “value” in the following terms:
        - (1) the substance of value is abstract socially necessary labour time, which must be defined as a homogeneous unit capable of aggregating and measuring all heterogeneous types of human labour-power (Marx 1906: 45–46);
        - (2) so therefore value is abstract, socially necessary labour time embodied, crystallised, or materialised in commodities, and
        - (3) the magnitude of value or quantitative measure of value is the amount of abstract socially necessary labour time, counted in homogeneous units (Marx 1906: 45–46).  
            Marx also thought that market prices move around and are determined by labour values, since the latter are the equilibrium price anchors for a capitalist system.  
            
    - (2) capitalism tends to increase the (1) accumulation, (2) concentration (accumulation over time) and (3) centralisation of capital. Capitalism will therefore have a tremendous tendency towards monopoly.
    - (3) capitalism will tend to destroy more and more capitalists and result in huge centralisation of capital (or monopoly) and reduce even capitalists to the proletarian class;
    - (4) capitalism will tend to use more and more machines and automation in production resulting in a huge body of unemployed people.
    - (5) the industrial reserve army of labour (the unemployed) grows and grows, and helps to hold real wages in check (see Chapter 25 of Capital). Even more, Marx thought that a large and growing industrial reserve army is a necessary condition of capitalism: it was a “condition of existence of the capitalist mode of production” (Marx 1906: 646).
    - (6) the tendency of capitalism is to keep the real wage at a subsistence level, which is the value of the maintenance and reproduction of labour-power (on this, see Chapter 25 of Capital and here). Wages rise and fall around this subsistence level as an equilibrium process;
    - (7) machines will only increase the intensity, speed and arduousness of work for the proletarians and their misery (see Chapter 15 of volume 1), and also increase the employment of women and children who are paid a lower wage than adult men (although government laws might counter this latter trend to some extent). The adult men are then increasing thrown out of work by machines and women and children replace them with lower wages;
    - (8) volume 3 of Capital adds to this the tendency of the profit rate to fall, but this mechanism is not invoked in volume 1 as one of the causes of the collapse, and some modern Marxists now dispute just how important the tendency of the falling rate of profit was for the final collapse of capitalism in Marx’s theory, as the emphasis given to this may be more the result of Engels’ tendentious editing of volume 3 of Capital.
    - (9) eventually almost the whole of society is reduced to the proletarian class with only a tiny handful of monopoly capitalists, who according to Marx “usurp and monopolise all advantages of this process of transformation” (Marx 1906: 836).
    - (10) the huge and constantly growing class of proletarians, who are kept in poverty with a subsistence wage, are subject to an increasing “mass of misery, oppression, slavery, degradation, [and] exploitation” (Marx 1906: 836). As in the passage of Engels quoted by Marx, the “other classes perish and disappear in the face of Modern Industry” (Marx 1906: 837, n. 1).
    - (11) finally, the proletarians eventually organise and rebel against capitalism, overthrowing the system.  
        Now these theories and predictions judged in their totality were not the long-run tendency of capitalism.  
        
- Even if a few elements are true (e.g., the increasing use of machines), nevertheless Marx’s vision is a Marxist caricature of capitalism which has been falsified by history.
## Boom Bust Cycle
- Crises have become less common over time and a higher proportion of countries in the world are growing at all times:
    
    - `The pandemic underscores the crucial value of global coordination and cooperation in public health as well as in economic policy. Cooperation across governments, and between governments, non-governmental organizations, and the private sector is necessary to help build domestic capacity to detect and respond to health crises, as well as develop and disseminate global public goods such as vaccines. Global coordination is vital for transferring health supplies and expertise where they are most needed in the near term, and to develop a coordinated exit strategy from restrictions on the free movement of people in the medium term. Moreover, the unprecedented common economic shock adds to the growing evidence of the gains from coordinating monetary and fiscal actions across countries (Bodenstein, Corsetti, and Guerrieri 2020; Triggs 2018). In late March, the G7 pledged to “do whatever is necessary to restore confidence and economic growth and to protect jobs, businesses, and the resilience of the financial system” (U.S. Department of the Treasury 2020).` [link](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/33748/211553-Ch01.pdf?sequence=18&isAllowed=y) - Global Economic Prospects, 2020
    
- A 2001 Paper found that:
    
    - Output volatility has enormously fallen in the US and other high-income countries (G7) (minus Japan). They also found that higher inflation and higher inflation volatility both predict higher output volatility -- but the time trend predicts lower volatility `We have documented the long and large decline in output volatility over the last half-century.` [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1353/eca.2001.0013) - The Long and Large Decline in U.S. Output Volatility, Blanchard and Simon, 2001
    
- A 2018 Paper found that there was no evidence for the post-2008 era having seen increased volatility.
    
    - `In this paper, we focused on break detection in mean and in variance on output growth for a set of advanced countries, based on statistical test procedures. It turns out that the Great Recession period is characterized by large breaks in mean of transitory nature, while dates of breaks in variance are consistent with the Great Moderation period in the eighties. This leads us to conclude that there is no evidence favoring an end of the low output volatility period, but rather that the Great Recession has a dramatically short-lived effect on the output growth but not on its volatility.` [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1111/ecin.12551) - Does The Great Recession Imply The End Of The Great Moderation? International Evidence, Charles et al., 2018
    
- Good monetary policy is the claim to low volatility of capital in the US, namely The Great Moderation.
    
    - `The Great Moderation is the name given to the period of decreased macroeconomic volatility experienced in the United States from the mid-1980s to the financial crisis in 2007.` `The Great Moderation is seen as a part of the monetary policy framework laid by Paul Volcker and continued by Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke during their time as Federal Reserve chairs.` [link](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/great-moderation.asp#:~:text=The%20Great%20Moderation%20is%20the,States%20starting%20in%20the%201980s.&text=The%20Great%20Moderation%20can%20be,inflation%20and%20positive%20economic%20growth.)

### Notes
- Elinor Ostrom’s work on common pool resources show thoroughly that bottom-up approaches of consensus and agreement are what allow such approaches to work. While not explicitly socialist, her work does show people overcoming the tragedy of the commons (which is a common argument against socialism) for a long time, sometimes _hundreds_ of years.
- USSR was playing catch-up utilizing technology developed under capitalism. Growth rates tapered off as its industry matured. Failed to develop an internet because of infighting.
- Censorship of science under the USSR: most obvious fields that were suppressed were genetics, cybernetics and physics. USSR also censored photocopier which made communication difficult because they feared uprising
- Stafford Beer’s Cybersyn was built using cybernetic principles and rejected centralized planning so the system could be more adaptive
- 20th century "communist" regimes all failed miserably and at best, were little better than colonial capitalism. In their wake they left deeply reactionary societies and their ruling elites flipped to fascists almost overnight
- Nation-states’ military doctrines, often based on vertical command structure, are slow to respond to decentralised warfare by non-state actors
## Falling Rate of Profit
- A 1976 paper found that:
    
    - `The above very sketchy review of the literature on Marx's law of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall has shown us that-at present-no satisfactory formulation of this law exists.` [link](https://sci-hub.st/https://www.jstor.org/stable/1817193?seq=1) - Marx and the Falling Rate of Profit, Christiansen, 1976
    
- A 2007 journal found that:
    
    - `A more realistic estimate of annual working hours is provided by Huberman (2002), who takes into account differences in weekly working hours, paid leave and public holidays. As Figure 3.1 shows, working hours in industrialized countries were reduced dramatically in the last century. In the Netherlands, for example, workers worked 3,285 hours per year in 1870 but only 1,347 hours in 2000. Interestingly, this reduction of working hours coincided with economic progress: the period of severe economic turbulence between 1929 and 1950 was accompanied by fluctuations in working hours, sometimes involving an upward trend. Other periods such as post-World War I and post-World War II are largely characterized by progressive reductions in working hours.` [link](https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/@dgreports/@dcomm/@publ/documents/publication/wcms_104895.pdf) - Working Time Around the World, Messenger et al., 2007
    
- A 2014 paper found that:
    
    - `The examination of the determining factors of long-run profitability in the manufacturing sector has been largely neglected in the literature. Existing studies either overlook the internal profit dynamics of the sector for the sake of international developments or do not go beyond the application of descriptive statistics. Starting from the theoretical concepts of Marx-biased technical change and the tendential fall in the rate of profit, we intend to fill this gap with the use of multivariate cointegration analysis. A Vector Error Correction Model using a time-series dataset that covers the entire postwar era is applied to test the long-run relationship between the rate of profit and a set of variables. The analysis is extended to capital-intensive and labour-intensive industries within manufacturing. We find one true long-run relationship between the set of variables in all models. Capital intensity is found to have a negative impact on the profit rate in all models tested, providing evidence for Marx-biased technical change. The effect of real wages is also negative in the models where a statistically significant contribution is established. Labour productivity has the largest positive effect in all models and is promoted as the decisive counteracting force to the negative burdens on the rate of profit. A secular declining trend in the rate of profit cannot be confirmed.` [link](http://lup.lub.lu.se/luur/download?func=downloadFile&recordOId=4648167&fileOId=4648170) - Technology, distribution, and long-run profit rate dynamics in the U.S. manufacturing sector, 1948-2011: evidence from a Vector Error Correction Model (VECM), Kalogerakos, 2014
    
- A 2018 paper found that:
    
    - `The results for this nonlinear approach reinforce previous empirical evidence that does not provide support for a systematic and declining tendency in profit rate as advanced in the Marxian literature.` `The model appears to provide a satisfactory portrayal of the evolution of the profit rate and the pattern of long swings reinforces previous rejections of the hypothesis of a consistent declining tendency of the profit rate.` [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1080/13504851.2017.1352074) - Profit rate in the US, 1949–2007: a Markov switching assessment, Resende, 2018

    - `We find that from 1980 onwards, markups have risen from 21% to nearly 61% in 2014, an increase of 40 points.

## Labor Theory Of Value
- The Labor Theory of Value claims that Goods + Labor Inputs + Surplus Value = Value of the Commodity
- The Labor Theory of Value is defined by four different elements:
    - Abstract Labour: economically valuable work time
    - Concrete Labour: particular activity that has a specific useful effect.
    - Use Value: a commodities capacity to satisfy a human need.
    - Exchange Value: determines ratio which a commodity is exchangeable with every other commodity.
- Marx asserts that LTV only applies to the averages of various goods, not individual goods making this a self-admitted incomplete theory of value:
    
    - `But without the leave, and behind the back, of our weaver, the old-fashioned mode of weaving undergoes a change. The labour-time that yesterday was without doubt socially necessary to the production of a yard of linen, ceases to be so to-day, a fact which the owner of the money is only too eager to prove from the prices quoted by our friend s competitors. Unluckily for him, weavers are not few and far between. Lastly, suppose that every piece of linen in the market contains no more labour-time than is socially necessary. In spite of this, all these pieces taken as a whole, may have had superfluous labour-time spent upon them. If the market cannot stomach the whole quantity at the normal price of 2 shillings a yard, this proves that too great a portion of the total labour of the community has been expended in the form of weaving. The effect is the same as if each individual weaver had expended more labour-time upon his particular product than is socially necessary. Here we may say, with the German proverb: caught together, hung together. All the linen in the market counts but as one article of commerce, of which each piece is only an aliquot part. And as a matter of fact, the value also of each single yard is but the materialised form of the same definite and socially fixed quantity of homogeneous human labour.` [link](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch03.htm) - Capital: a critique of political economy. Vol. 1, Marx, 1867
    
- In a journal called `Marxian Economics: A Reappraisal Essays On Volume III Of Capital - Volume 2: Profits, Prices And Dynamics`, In a section called `The Empirical Strength of the Labour Theory of Value`, Anwar Shaikh argues that the theory holds as proved by showing that total labor total times vs price of production correlates to each other. [link](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafykbzaceaccp5bzqpxfaxysdgcgzbgeau6k75iwtvq64qczstpu74i7lobsc?filename=%5B%5D+Riccardo+Bellofiore+%28eds.%29+-+Marxian+Economics%3A+A+Reappraisal%3A+Volume+2%3A+Essays+on+Volume+III+of+Capital+Profit%2C+Prices+and+Dynamics+%281998%2C+Palgrave+Macmillan%29+%5B10.1007%2F978-1-349-26121-5%5D.pdf) - Marxian Economics: A Reappraisal: Volume 2: Essays On Volume Iii Of Capital, Profits, Prices And Dynamics, Bellofiore, 1998
- Andrew Kliman argues that the problem with Shaikh's claim is that because `price of production` is represented through the input-output of an entire sector of an economy, it misses the value of a single product from said sector and doesn't factor the size of a given sector. So Kiman replicates the data:
    
    - `The measures of distance indicate that prices differed from adjusted values by an average of about +/-8% to +/-13%. Such results, and even somewhat weaker ones, are typically taken as providing strong confirmation that values are close to market prices. Yet what can we infer from this closeness and what can we not validly infer?` [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1093/cje/26.3.299) - The law of value and laws of statistics: sectoral values and prices in the US economy, 1977—97, Kliman, 2002
    
- Kliman then adjusts the price and value of each sector by its aggregate labour and non-labour costs.
    
    - `I have chosen to deflate the sectoral aggregate prices and values by aggregate labour and non labour costs.` [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1093/cje/26.3.299) - The law of value and laws of statistics: sectoral values and prices in the US economy, 1977–97
    
- Kliman then finds after adjustment, no correlation between labor input and value occurs
    
    - `Once the effects of industry size are removed, it is not the case that prices are high in high-value sectors and low in low-value sectors. Rather, size-adjusted prices and values are close only in the sense that almost all sectors prices are close to almost all sectors values. I thus find that, on average, a sector s value is no better a predictor of its price than is a random variable with the same probability distribution as the values.` [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1093/cje/26.3.299) - The law of value and laws of statistics: sectoral values and prices in the US economy, 1977–97
    
- In their book `Capital is Power`, Jonathan Nitzan & Shimshon Bichler argue that Labor Theory of Value researchers assume wages equal the value of labor power (among other assumptions), which results in circular reasoning,
    
    - `The most important of these assumptions are that the value of labour power is proportionate to the actual wage rate, that the ratio of variable capital to surplus value is given by the price ratio of wages to profit, and occasionally also that the value of the depreciated constant capital is equal to a fraction of the capital’s money price. In other words, the researcher assumes precisely what the labour theory of value is supposed to demonstrate.` - [link](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/bafykbzacedvvf6kzqa35zvfvyix6otsy2yy53llgmxiukm5lzsqmpkfouzvbc?filename=Jonathan%20Nitzan%2C%20Shimshon%20Bichler%20-%20Capital%20as%20Power_%20A%20Study%20of%20Order%20and%20Creorder%20%28Ripe%20Series%20in%20Global%20Political%20Economy%29%20%282009%29.pdf) Capital as power: a study of order and creorder, Nitzan and Bichler, 2009
    
- Nitzan And Bichler then try to present an example demonstrating that, even when price and value are totally uncorrelated, aggregate price and value will be strongly correlated, demonstrating that this correlation is spurious.

## Modern Monetary Theory
- MMT doesn't have a testable, falsifiable hypothesis that we can compare to neoclassical economics.
    
    - `ME/MMT is distinguished by its explicit recognition that the currency itself is a public monopoly, which is the micro foundation of fiat currency. MEMMT then builds the ramifications of that fundamental understanding.` [link](http://www00.unibg.it/dati/corsi/910003/64338-Warren%20Mosler%20Bergamo%20paper%20March%2010.pdf)
    
- MMT claims that currency is a tax credit but doesn't explain the format of that tax credit, unlike conventional tax credits which are in dollars, which would make tax credits - currency - tax credits which is circular.
    
    - `ME/MMT recognizes that with fiat currency, the funds the government spends are best thought of as tax credits. Likewise, the funds the government spends that are not immediately used to pay taxes remain in the economy as ‘monetary savings’ until used to pay taxes in the future. Furthermore, these tax credits outstanding constitute what is called the ‘national debt’.` [link](http://www00.unibg.it/dati/corsi/910003/64338-Warren%20Mosler%20Bergamo%20paper%20March%2010.pdf)
    
- MMT has also been explained by its founder very similarly to what the U.S. Federal Reserve already does, making it a subject within Keynesian Economics.
    
    - `MEMMT presumes the role of government is to establish and sustain public infrastructure for public purpose, and that the currency is a tool of government for the promotion of public purpose. Accordingly, what MEMMT offers are fiscal and monetary proposals that sustain employment opportunities for anyone willing and able to work, and that optimize real terms of trade, all in support of real standards of living.` [link](http://www00.unibg.it/dati/corsi/910003/64338-Warren%20Mosler%20Bergamo%20paper%20March%2010.pdf)
    
- An IGM survey of a panel of 26 economists found that 0% agree with MMT in any degree of agreement. [link](https://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/modern-monetary-theory/)
- MMT has been tried in various Latin American countries and caused runaway inflation, huge currency devaluations, and precipitous real wage declines.
    
    - `Almost every one of the Latin American experiments with major central bank–financed fiscal expansions took place under populist regimes, and all of them ended up badly, with runaway inflation, huge currency devaluations, and precipitous real wage declines. In most of these episodes — Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Peru, and Venezuela — policymakers used arguments similar to those made by MMTers to justify extensive use of money creation to finance very large increases in public expenditures.` [link](https://www.cato.org/cato-journal/fall-2019/modern-monetary-theory-cautionary-tales-latin-america)
    
- In a PBS interview with Paul Krugman on Modern Monetary Theory, he is asked about the claim of `The Government Cannot Go Bankrupt` made by MMTers and replies,
    
    - `Yeah, this is basically true, but you don't need a new theory for that, we kinda knew that already. To a large extent, they're just doing Keynesian Economics, but they don't know they're doing Keynesian Economics and they've invented their own terminology for it.` [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gyj1H-gjI8)

# Philosophical Critique
## Dialectical Materialism
- In `Dialectical and Historical Materialism`, Stalin writes about the `Marxist Philosophical Materialism` and in section a) `Materialist` he writes,
    
    - `Contrary to idealism, which regards the world as the embodiment of an "absolute idea," a "universal spirit," "consciousness," Marx's philosophical materialism holds that the world is by its very nature material, that the multifold phenomena of the world constitute different forms of matter in motion, that interconnection and interdependence of phenomena as established by the dialectical method, are a law of the development of moving matter, and that the world develops in accordance with the laws of movement of matter and stands in no need of a "universal spirit." "The materialistic outlook on nature," says Engels, "means no more than simply conceiving nature just as it exists, without any foreign admixture." (Marx and Engels, Vol. XIV, p. 651.) Speaking of the materialist views of the ancient philosopher Heraclitus, who held that "the world, the all in one, was not created by any god or any man, but was, is and ever will be a living flame, systematically flaring up and systematically dying down"' Lenin comments: "A very good exposition of the rudiments of dialectical materialism." (Lenin, Philosophical Notebooks, p. 318.)` [link](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1938/09.htm)
    
- While Idealism might not argue against Materialism well, modern conceptions of the Philosophy of Mind have had more contributions since 1938, when this work was published. Materialism, also commonly known as Physicalism has arguments against it, one more commonly known is The Knowledge Argument. The knowledge argument is one of the main challenges to physicalism, the doctrine that the world is entirely physical. The argument begins with the claim that there are truths about consciousness that cannot be deduced from the complete physical truth. A Mary's Room type example provides distinctive reasons for inferring physicalism’s falsity from intuition. Let us take these points in order. The Mary case divides the knowledge intuition into three claims: [link](https://iep.utm.edu/know-arg/)
    - The complete-knowledge claim: before leaving the room, Mary knows everything physical.
    - The learning claim: upon leaving, she learns something.
    - The non-deducibility claim: if the complete-knowledge claim and the learning claim are true, then what Mary learns when she leaves the room cannot be a priori deduced (deduced by reason alone, without empirical investigation) from the complete physical truth.
- It seems as if there is some immaterial form that is unaccounted for in the physicalist model. For an example argument against it I posit Abstractions as immaterial.
    - Argument Against Physicalism
- P1: If physicalism is true, all real things are physical
- P2: Abstractions are not physical but are real
- C1: Therefore, physicalism is false. (by modus tollens)
- In summary, if the idea of materialism is posited, then the mere fact of it being posited as an idea, an immaterial real proposition, it negates the argument.

## `Self-Hating White People`
- - `Remarkably, white liberals were the only subgroup exhibiting a pro-outgroup bias—meaning white liberals were more favorable toward nonwhites and are the only group to show this preference for group other than their own. Indeed, on average, white liberals rated ethnic and racial minority groups 13 points (or half a standard deviation) warmer than whites. As is depicted in the graph below, this disparity in feelings of warmth toward ingroup vs. outgroup is even more pronounced among whites who consider themselves “very liberal” where it widens to just under 20 points. Notably, while white liberals have consistently evinced weaker pro-ingroup biases than conservatives across time, the emergence and growth of a pro-outgroup bias is actually a very recent, and unprecedented, phenomenon.` [link](https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/americas-white-saviors) - The American White Savior Complex, Tablet Magazine, 2019
