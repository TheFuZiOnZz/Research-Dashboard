- In 1862, Rome and Jerusalem: The Last National Question is a book published by Moses Hess in 1862 in Leipzig. It gave impetus to the Labor Zionism movement. Hess argued for the Jews to return to Palestine, and proposed a socialist country in which the Jews would become agrarianised through a process of "redemption of the soil".

	- `The three prophetic harbingers of political Zionism, Rabbi Yehuda Alkalai (1798-1878), Rabbi Zvi Hirsch Kalischer (1795-1874), and Moses Hess (1812-1875), preceded by a full generation the actual emergence of the mass movement, and their visionary works had little immediate impact on their milieu. It took the successive shocks of the Russian pogroms of 1881-84 and the Dreyfus affair in France in the 1890s to set the stage for the blossoming of Zionism.`
	  
	  `Alkalai, Kalischer, and Hess were all influenced by the plight of the Jews and by contemporary nationalist movements. Both rabbis, Alkalai in Serbia and Kalischer in Poland (then Prussia), saw a return to the Land of Israel as a stage in the redemption of the Jews.`
	  
	  `Hess was a thoroughly westernized German socialist ideologue who had collaborated with Karl Marx before dramatically returning to the Jewish fold in the 1850s and publishing his major Zionist work, Rome and Jerusalem: The Last Nationality Question, in 1862. He sensed the emergence of modern anti-Semitism, which would prevent the Jews from assimilating in Christian society, and he also understood that the Middle East was about to be swept by a wave of national liberation movements in conflict with the Ottoman Empire. He felt that the state the Jews would establish in the heart of the Middle East would serve Western imperial interests and at the same time help bring Western civilization to the backward East.`
