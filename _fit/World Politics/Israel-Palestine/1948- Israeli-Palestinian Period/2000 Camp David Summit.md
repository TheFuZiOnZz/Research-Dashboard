## 2000 Camp David Summit
- [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_Camp_David_Summit)
- A Summit meeting between Bill Clinton, Ehud Barak, and Yasser Arafat.
- This summit failed to produce any actual agreements.
- Israel was offering in 10-25 years 91% of the current West Bank along with a 1% land swap (from the Negev), maintaining an enclave of settlers in Kiryat Arba (near Hebron), linked with a bypass road.
- The West Bank would be split by an Israeli controlled road from Jerusalem to the Dead See, with free passage for Palestinians, with Israeli right to road closure.
- An elevated railroad and highway running through the Negev would link the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
- Airspace would still be controlled exclusively by Israel.
- US claim about what was offered -Â [http://www.mideastweb.org/lastmaps.htm](http://www.mideastweb.org/lastmaps.htm)
- Palestinians claim they were offered Bantustans, a loaded word coming from South African apartheid divisions.
- East Jerusalem was the center-focus for both the Israelis and the Palestinians.
- Israel refuses the broad Right of Return for Palestinian peoples to the country of Israel, but proposes instead a maximum of 100,000 refugees be allowed to return to Israel on the basis of humanitarian consideration or family reunification, while also contributing to a $30b fund to compensate Palestinian refugees for property lost.
- Israel wanted to push for an aggressive security arrangement that would heavily favor Israeli security concerns, including access to all Palestinian airspace, troop presence on the Jordanian border, the demilitarization of Palestine, and Israeli radar installations within Palestine.
- Negotiations continued through the Clinton Parameters, though no final agreement was reached, despite both sides claiming they were closer than they ever had been after the Taba negotiations in January of 2001.
- Responsibility for failure
    - The Americans, including Clinton and several observers, claim that the failure of the talks hinged on Arafat and the Palestinians refusal to give up on future negotiations relating to the Right of Return, which the Americans believed would ultimately result in the Palestinians fighting for a return to a one state solution in Historic Palestine.
    - A Clinton special advisor complains that Israel was not willing to concede a reasonable amount to the Palestinians, considering how much they were already willing to give up, including Jewish neighborhoods in East Jerusalem and trading favorable parts of the West Bank to Israel.
    - Some argue that the lack of religious consideration hindered discussion around Jerusalem.
    - Finkelstein argues that Israel really was giving up nothing at all that made the Palestinian concessions worth considering.
    - Polling data around the time from Palestinians and their attitude towards Israel.
