## 1987-93 First Intifada
- [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Intifada)
- General Causes
    - Israel opened up low and semi-skilled labor markets to Palestinians in occupied territory. By the time of the Intifada, over 40% of Palestinian workers were working in Israel daily.
    - Palestinian populations were growing, but work and other opportunities were heavily restricted in the occupied territories.
    - The Jewish settler population in the West Bank grew from 35,000 in 1984 to 130,000 by the mid 1990's.
    - The occupied Palestinians likely felt themselves humiliated in a variety of ways as indefinite occupation by Israel continued.
- Background
    - Two potential causes that sparked the Intifada
        - The army tank transporter truck incident in which 4 Palestinians were killed by an Israel truck crashing into them.
        - The IDF failure in late November 1987 to stop a Palestinian guerrilla operation, the Night of the Gliders, in which six Israeli soldiers were killed.
    - Mass demonstrations occurred a year earlier after 2 Gaza students were shot by Israeli soldiers on campus on December 4th, 1986.
    - The Arab summit in Amman in November of 1987 focuses heavily on the Iran-Iraq war, sidelining the Palestinian issue for the first time in years.
- Leadership and Aims
    - The Intifada was mainly lead by independent community councils and advocated for a non-violent approach so that the Palestinians would not lose support from liberal Israelis.
    - For the first time Palestinians are calling for the establishment of a Palestinian state on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, notably departing from the standard rhetorical calls for the "liberation" of all of Palestine.
- The Intifada
    - Israel had assumed that its oppressive actions against the Palestinians would cause their resistance to collapse early, though this was a mistaken assumption.
    - On December 8th, 1987, an Israeli army tank transporter crashed into a row of cars, killing four Palestinians. They were residents of the Jabalya refugee camp, the largest of the eight refugee camps in the Gaza Strip. 7 others were seriously injured.
    - Assumptions about the crash lead to demonstrations, which caused back and forth violence between Israelis and Palestinians.
    - In the beginning of the Intifada, no Israeli settlements were attacked nor were there any Israeli fatalities.
    - The IDF used every crowd control measure available, though disturbances continued to gain momentum.
    - Israel engaged in mass arrests and the closure of Palestinian schools and businesses, utilities and confinement to homes, as well as damage to farms and blockage from selling agricultural produce. Settlers also engaged in private violence against Palestinians.
- Casualties~1,200 Palestinians killed, 57k-120k arrested, 481 deported, 2,532 houses destroyed.179-200 Israelis killed, 3,100 Israelis (1,700 soldiers vs 1,400 civilians) suffered injuries.Between 1988 and 1992, intra-Palestinian violence claimed the lives of nearly 1,000, mainly due to the PLO killings of suspected collaborators.
- Foreign reaction
    - The UN (including the US) drafted a resolution condemning alleged Israeli violations of human rights. Israel declared it would not abide by SCR672 because it did not pay attention to attacks on Jewish worshippers. Israel also blocked a delegation of the Secretary-General for investigating Israeli violence.
- Outcomes
    - The Intifada broke the image of Jerusalem as a united city, and the increase in international coverage was heavily critical of Israel.
    - Arafat and his followers moderated their political programme; at the meeting of the Palestine National Council in Algiers in November of 1988, Arafat won a majority for the historic decision to recognize Israel's legitimacy, to accept all relevant UN resolutions going back November 29th, 1947, and to adopt the principle of a two-state solution.
    - Arafat's support for Sadam Hussein's invasion into Kuwait essentially lead to a mass exodus of 300,000+ Palestinians fleeing Kuwait, mostly to return to Jordan. It also lead to Kuwait and Saudi Arabia cutting off financial support to the PLO.
