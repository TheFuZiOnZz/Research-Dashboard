- [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Conference_of_1991)
- Hosted by Spain and co-sponsored by the United States and the Soviet Union
    - Involved Israel and the Palestinians, as well as Arab countries, including Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria.
- US Secretary of State James Baker told an AIPAC audience that Israel needs to abandon its expansionist policies.
- Bush and Baker attempted to pressure Israel off of using any loan guarantees for settlement expansion, pushing heavily against them.
- Shamir believed he could simply influence via the Israeli lobby politicians and the US public against Bush's wishes, but Bush's approval rating was too high, and eventually all parties agreed to convene in Madrid.
- Feelings internationally were hopeful from this, with two successful bilateral agreements following this, namely the Oslo I accords, and the Israeli-Jordanian negotiations after.
