<li>Social Democracy is when the government does stuff, more specifically that the government helps create a basic standard of living through well researched growth plans and tax policy focusing on primarily Wealth Inequality and Income Mobility to create a prosperous model for all.<ul>
<li><code>Social democracy (sometimes used synonymously with democratic socialism) refers to a political tendency resting on three fundamental features: (1) democracy (e.g., equal rights to vote and form parties), (2) an economy partly regulated by the state (e.g., through Keynesianism), and (3) a welfare state offering social support to those in need (e.g., equal rights to education, health service, employment, and pensions).</code> - <a href="https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/bafykbzacebgzz6ymnszyxxyf36llncqhplu4zilj5nsajnxynpaxpiymbldq4?filename=Bertrand%20Badie%2C%20Dirk%20Berg-Schlosser%2C%20Leonardo%20Morlino%20-%20International%20Encyclopedia%20of%20Political%20Science-SAGE%20Publications%2C%20Inc%20%282011%29.pdf">International encyclopedia of political science, Badie et al., 2011</a><h1 id="why-social-democracy-">Why Social Democracy?</h1>

<li>The Rehn–Meidner model is an economic and wage policy model developed in 1951 by two economists at the research department of the Swedish Trade Union Confederation, Gösta Rehn and Rudolf Meidner.

<li><code>Full employment was maintained practically for the whole period. At the same time, the labour force participation rate rose to a peak European level, primarily because of the almost total integration of women into the labour market.

Equality of wage distribution was a vital union goal, and wage dispersion data indicate that, during this era of centralized “solidarity” bargaining, LO succeeded in obtaining large changes in the structure of relative wages. In fact, as the data graphed in figure 1 illustrate, between the early 1960s and the breakdown of central wage formation in the early 1980s, the total variance of bluecollar relative wages declined by a whopping 75%.</code> - <a href="https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1086/209976">Wage Dispersion and Productive Efficiency: Evidence for Sweden, Hibbs Jr. and Locking, 2000</a></li>

<li><code>Social democratic Full employment Price stability Combination of restrictive general measures and selective labour market policy governments also accommodated the unions in another way: excess profits - which make wage restraint in profitable firms hazardous for the local unions - have been at least partly neutralized by payments into different funds, (among them the union-administered wage-earner funds - albeit in a rather symbolic shape, as we shall see).</code> - <a href="https://socialistregister.com/index.php/srv/article/view/5630/2528">Why Did the Swedish Model Fail?, Meidner, 1993</a></li>

<li>A 2003 paper found that:<ul>
<li><code>The response of management, we argue, was a perfectly rational one to a serious labour problem. The most dynamic and largest firms in the economy faced severe labour supply shortages in the early postwar years that threatened to compromise their competitive position and choke off growth. Ironically, it was the Rehn-Meidner plan, the work of two labour union economists, that saved the day. While centralised wage bargaining played an instrumental role in the plan, it was the former, not the latter, that created the conditions for wage moderation. As we explain in this article, the purpose of the plan was to promote economic expansion with full employment and low inflation and to ensure that labour received its fair share of the growth dividend. The process was ingenious and simple. Wage increases for low paid workers would exceed increases for those higher up on the pay scale. This would compel low-wage firms to shut down (or raise productivity) and would thus liberate workers for employment in the high- wage, high-growth sectors. Labour transfer was to be facilitated by an active labour market policy on the part of the government - retraining, relocation, and job search assistance. Centralised wage determination was viewed strictly as a means to an end - it made possible wage compression from below and fostered labour release. In essence, then, the Rehn-Meidner plan produced wage moderation in a very conventional manner - it facilitated an increase in the supply of labour to the most dynamic sectors of the economy. In this respect, the Swedish experience is much closer to that of, say, Germany and Italy than is usually recognised.</code> - <a href="https://www.economics.utoronto.ca/malex/cwbjan28full.pdf">Centralized Wage Bargaining and Structural Change In Sweden, Alexopoulos, 2003</a></li>

<li>A 2010 paper found that:<ul>
<li><code>The typical Swedish economic and wage policy program — the R-M model — was never consistently implemented. Yet, a period from the late 1950s to the early 1970s was the golden age for the model; it legitimized the expansion of labor-market policy and the practice of the wage policy of solidarity in Sweden. There were some unique Swedish circumstances behind the application of the R-M model — the highly coordinated wage bargaining system, the strong position for state interventionism, the political dominance of the social democrats and the strength and priorities of LO. Also, by emphasizing price-stability and growth, the R-M model yielded a strong economic rationale for labor-market policies and wage policy of solidarity. Swedish deviations from the model since the middle of the 1970s are explained by negative policy experiences, lost positions and new strategies of LO, new generations of economic policy decision makers, new economic theories (challenging discretionary economic policy) and the growing influence of economists in the Ministry of Finance. The break with the R-M model is also explained by less coordinated wage bargaining (threatening the wage policy of solidarity) and by political-institutional changes, primarily deregulation of credit markets (leading to overheating in the 1980s) and new exchange-rate systems (providing more space for profit booms through devaluations/depreciations).</code> - <a href="https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.2753/jei0021-3624440306">The Rehn-Meidner Model in Sweden: Its Rise, Challenges and Survival, Erixon, 2010</a><h3 id="norwegian-aukrust-efo-model">Norwegian Aukrust-EFO Model</h3>

Among the U.S. based studies, the results suggest that the effect of teacher merit pay on student test scores is positive and statistically significant (0.043 standard deviation).
