# 1939 UK Committee Report on the McMahon-Hussein Correspondence
- On 16 March 1939, the UK released a report titled `Report of a Committee Set Up To Consider Certain Correspondence Between Sir Henry McMahon And The Sharif of Mecca`. The committee was set up to clarify the many commitments that had been made during and after the First World War and that all of them would have to be studied together.
    - `The United Kingdom representatives have, however, informed the Arab representatives that the Arab contentions, as explained to the committee, regarding the interpretation of the Correspondence, and especially their contentions relating to the meaning of the phrase " portions of Syria lying to the west of the districts of Damascus, Hama, Homs and Aleppo ", have greater force than has appeared hitherto.
      
      `Furthermore, the United Kingdom representatives have informed the Arab representatives that they agree that Palestine was included in the area claimed by the Sharif of Mecca in his letter of the l4th July, 1915, and that unless Palestine was excluded from that area later in the Correspondence it must be regarded as having been included in the area in which Great Britain was to recognise and support the independence of the Arabs. They maintain that on a' proper construction of the Correspondence Palestine was in fact excluded. But they agree that the language in which its exclusion was expressed was not so specific and unmistakable as it was thought to be at the time.`- [Report of a Committee Set Up To Consider Certain Correspondence Between Sir Henry McMahon And The Sharif of Mecca](https://web.archive.org/web/20171201031431/https://unispal.un.org/DPA/DPR/unispal.nsf/0/4C4F7515DC39195185256CF7006F878C)
    - `It is beyond the scope of the Committee to express an opinion upon the proper interpretation of the various statements mentioned in paragraph 19 and such an opinion could not in any case be properly expressed unless consideration had also been given to a number of other statements made during and after the war. In the opinion of the Committee it is, however, evident from these statements that His Majesty's Government were not free to dispose of Palestine without regard for the wishes and interests of the inhabitants of Palestine, and that these statements must all be taken into account in any attempt to estimate the responsibilities which—upon any interpretation of the Correspondence—His Majesty's Government have incurred towards those inhabitants as a result of the Correspondence.`- [Report of a Committee Set Up To Consider Certain Correspondence Between Sir Henry McMahon And The Sharif of Mecca](https://web.archive.org/web/20171201031431/https://unispal.un.org/DPA/DPR/unispal.nsf/0/4C4F7515DC39195185256CF7006F878C)
