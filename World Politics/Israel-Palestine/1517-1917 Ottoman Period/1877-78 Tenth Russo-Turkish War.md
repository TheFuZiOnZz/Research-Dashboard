	- `The years 1876-78 saw a severe crisis in the empire. There were three sultans within eighteen months, the last of whom, Abdiilhamid II (1842-1918), who ruled until 1909, promulgated a new constitution at the end of 1876. The first parliament was convened in March 1877. The delegates included dozens of Arabs, for whom this was the first taste of national-level politics. The following month Russia declared war on Constantinople. Thousands of Arab conscripts from Syria, Lebanon, and Palestine died in the war, which ended in Ottoman defeat in March 1878, a month after Abdiilhamid dissolved parliament and suspended the new constitution. The casualties stoked Arab hostility toward Constantinople. In 1878 Muslim, Maronite, and Druze leaders from Syria and Lebanon met with the exiled Algerian rebel leader 'Abd al-Qadir alJaza'iri, who lived in Damascus, and considered proclaiming an independent Arab republic with him at its head. But al-Jaza'iri opposed complete independence, and the Ottoman authorities got wind of the movement, exiled some leaders, and imposed restrictions on others.` - [Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-2001, Benny Morris](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/bafykbzaced6rtb5d4wthw3wapbnqafd3w7znfmikvzx43dqifs5amzbyzltas?filename=Righteous%20Victims%3A%20A%20History%20of%20the%20Zionist-Arab%20Conflict%2C%20--%20Benny%20Morris%20--%202001%20--%20Vintage%20--%209780679744757%20--%200ffdde5f35058146403a55786f6cfc18%20--%20Anna%E2%80%99s%20Archive.pdf)
