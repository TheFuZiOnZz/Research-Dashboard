- On 15 May 1948, The Secretary-General of the Arab League responded to the Israeli Declaration of Independence with a cablegram to the Secretary-General of the United Nations stating discontent for the current situation and declaring that the Arab Governments felt they needed to intervene to establish a `United State of Palestine`, which to them was `the only fair and just solution to the problem of Palestine`.
    - `The recent disturbances in Palestine further constitute a serious and direct threat to peace and security within the territories of the Arab States themselves. For these reasons, and considering that the security of Palestine is a sacred trust for them, and out of anxiousness to check the further deterioration of the prevailing conditions and to prevent the spread of disorder and lawlessness into the neighbouring Arab lands, and in order to fill the vacuum created by the determination of the Mandate and the failure to replace it by any legally constituted authority, the Arab Governments find themselves compelled to intervene for the sole purpose of restoring peace and security and establishing law and order in Palestine. The Arab States recognize that the independence and sovereignty of Palestine which was so far subject to the British Mandate has now, with the termination of the Mandate, become established in fact, and maintain that the lawful inhabitants of Palestine are alone competent and entitled to set up an administration in Palestine for the discharge of all governmental functions without any external interference. As seen as that stage is reached the intervention of the Arab States, which is confined to the restoration of peace and establishment of law and order, shall be put an end to, and the sovereign State of Palestine will be competent in co-operation with the other State members of the Arab League, to take every step for the promotion of the welfare and security of its peoples and territory. The Governments of the Arab States hereby confirm at this stage the view that had been repeatedly declared by them on previous occasions, such as the London Conference and before the United Nations mainly, the only fair and just solution to the problem of Palestine is the creation of United State of Palestine based upon the democratic principles which will enable all its inhabitants to enjoy equality before the law, and. which would guarantee to all minorities the safeguards provided for in all democratic constitutional States affording at the same time full protection and free access to Holy places. The Arab States emphatically and repeatedly declare that their intervention in Palestine has been prompted solely by the considerations and for the aims set out above and that they are not inspired by any other motive whatsoever. They are, therefore, confident that their action will receive the support of the United Nations as tending to further the aims and ideals of the United Nations as set out in its Charter".` [Cablegram from the Secretary-General of the League of Arab States of the 15 May 1948]([https://www.un.org/Docs/journal/asp/ws.asp?m=S/745](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/29/Cablegram_dated_15_May_1948_addressed_to_the_Secretary-General_by_the_Secretary-General_of_the_League_of_Arab_States.pdf))
