- International media claimed Israel lacked proper justification for the raid into Al-Shifa Hospital on November 13th.
    1. The hospital's head of surgery, Dr. Marwan Abu Saada, [said](https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-middle-east-67400490/page/7) "We are civilians. I am a doctor-surgeon. We have medical staff, we have patients, and displaced people. Nothing else."

- United States intelligence services [agree](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/02/us/politics/gaza-hospital-hamas.html) with IDF services based on independently collected intel that the hospital was used by Hamas and PIJ to command forces and hold some hostages. The IDF [showed](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/17/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-tunnel-hamas.html) a massive tunnel shaft at Gaza Hospital to reporters after initially taking it over.
- The NYT did [an analysis](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/02/12/world/middleeast/gaza-tunnel-israel-hamas.html) based on classified documents from the IDF, claiming that the intelligence suggested Hamas used the tunnel for cover, stored weapons inside and maintained a harden tunnel system beneath Al-Shifa.
- Haaretz did [their own investigation](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-11-23/ty-article-magazine/.premium/did-hamas-operate-under-al-shifa-a-tour-of-the-tunnels-leaves-no-room-for-doubt/0000018b-f8c7-d783-a3df-f8df15600000) of Al-Shifa after the IDF raid and agreed that the medical personal and operators must have known Hamas was operating out of the hospital.
- The IDF released [surveillance camera footage](https://twitter.com/manniefabian/status/1726311040072474812) from Al-Shifa Hospital showing Hamas terrorists bringing a Nepali and Thai citizen there on October 7th, as well as footage of the hospital being utilized by Hamas militants.
- Israel went in and raided Al-Shifa a second time on March 18th, with the raid lasting 14 days. Israel claims to have arrested 900 suspected militants, with more than 500 being identified as members of Hamas or PIJ, with some of the detained being "commanders and significant people" according to [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/01/middleeast/israel-idf-withdraws-al-shifa-hospital-intl-hnk/index.html).
