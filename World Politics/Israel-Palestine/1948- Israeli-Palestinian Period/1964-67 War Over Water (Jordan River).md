## 1964-67 War Over Water (Jordan River)
- [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_over_Water_(Jordan_River))
- Water sharing from the Jordan-Yarmuk system turned out to be a major problem between Israel, Syria and Jordan.
    - The Yarmuk River is where the borders of Israel, Jordan and Syria converge.
- Israel began construction of an intake for its National Water Carrier at the Daughters of Jacob Bridge in the demilitarized zone north of the Sea of Galilee in July 1953.
- Syria protested to the UN, then artillery fired upon the construction site.
- UN Security Council voted to allow Israel to resume work, but it was vetoed by the Soviet Union.
- In 1955, the US brokered a deal, the Jordan Valley Unified Water Plan (Johnston Plan), and was accepted by technical committees of Israel and the Arab League.
- In January 1964 an [Arab League summit meeting convened in Cairo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1964_Arab_League_summit_(Cairo)) and decided:
    - “The establishment of Israel is the basic threat that the Arab nation in its entirety has agreed to forestall. And since the existence of Israel is a danger that threatens the Arab nation, the diversion of the Jordan waters by it multiplies the dangers to Arab existence. Accordingly, the Arab states have to prepare the plans necessary for dealing with the political, economic, and social aspects, so that if the necessary results are not achieved, collective Arab military preparations, when they are completed, will constitute the ultimate practical means for the final liquidation of Israel.”
- When the Arab states realized they couldn’t win militarily, they attempted to divert the Jordan River headwaters to the Yarmouk River. Israel declared it was an infringement on its sovereign rights.
