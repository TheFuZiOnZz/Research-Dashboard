- Summary
    - May 1967, Nasser mobilizes Egyptian military into defensive lines along the Israeli border and closes the shipping lanes through the Straits of Tiran to Israeli vessels, despite Israel warning this would be a _casus belli_. Nasser also orders the removal of all UNEF personnel.
    - Israel would capture the Sinai Peninsula, the Egyptian-occupied Gaza Strip, the West Bank from Jordan, and the Golan Heights from Syria.
        - Israel gave back the Sinai to Egypt.
    - Military: 20,000 Arab deaths vs 1,000 Israeli deaths Civilian: 20 Israeli Civilians killed in Arab forces air strikes on Jerusalem, 15 UN peacekeepers killed by Israeli strikes in the Sinai, and 34 US personnel killed in the USS _Liberty_ incident.
- Background
    - Following the 1956 Suez Crisis, Syria and Egypt signed a mutual defense agreement.
    - PLO activity and attacks against Israel from Arab countries continued.
    - In May, 1967, Nasser received bogus intel from the USSR that Israel was massing on the Syrian border, so he gathered troops in the Sinai Peninsula, ejected UNEF personnel, and once again denied passage of Israeli vessels through the Straits of Tiran.
    - On the 30th of May, Jordan an Egypt signed a defense pact. Iraq and Egypt began deploying troops and armored units in Jordan.
    - The United States did not believe at the time that Egypt was preparing for an offensive war against Israel, as per the [Watch Committee](https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1964-68v19/d73).
    - Nasser's [speech](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/statement-by-president-nasser-to-arab-trade-unionists-may-1967) towards the Arab Trade Unionists in May 26th, 1967, claimed "The battle will be a general one and our basic objective will be to destroy Israel."
        - Statements made by Nasser leading up to the war
            - “The armies of Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon are poised on the borders of Israel to face the challenge, while standing behind us are the armies of Iraq, Algeria, Kuwait, Sudan and the whole Arab nation. This act will astound the world. Today they will know that the Arabs are arranged for battle, the critical hour has arrived. We have reached the stage of serious action and not of more declarations.” Gamal Abdel Nasser May 30th 1967
            - Nasser May 26 "The Arab people wants to fight. We have been waiting for the right time when we will be completely ready. Recently we have felt that our strength has been sufficient and that if we make battle with Israel we shall be able, with the help of God, to conquer Sharm el-Sheikh implies a confrontation with Israel. Taking this step makes it imperative that we be ready to undertake a total war with Israel."
- Involved Forces
    - Egypt amassing 100,000 troops in the Sinai.
    - Syria deploying 75,000 along their border with Israel.
    - Jordanian Armed Forces totaled 55,000 troops.
    - 100 Iraqi tanks and an infantry division readied near the Jordanian border, along with two squadrons of Iraqi fighter-aircraft.
    - Saudi Arabia mobilized a few forces for deployment to the Jordanian front.
    - Arab air forces were also reinforced by aircraft from Libya, Algeria, Morocco, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia to make up for the first day losses of the war. Volunteer pilots also came from the Pakistan Air Force.
- Noteworthy Battle Things
    - Surprise attack on Egyptian airfield guaranteed all but certain victory in the Sinai for Israel.
    - IDF originally was to avoid Gaza strip/city, but attacks from that area forced the IDF to take over that territory.
    - Jordanian Army was instructed to lay a two-hour barrage against military and civilian settlements in central Israel itself.
    - Eshkol promised Israel would not initiate any action against Jordan if it stayed out of the way, but King Hussein refused.
    - Jordanian shelling of Jerusalem resulted in 20 dead and 1,000 wounded civilians.
    - Dayan ordered troops not to capture the Old City due to potential international backlash plus potential outrage of being forced to give back holy sites after capturing them. After hearing about the impending UN ceasefire, he changed his mind and captured it.
    - "Fearful that Israeli soldiers would exact retribution for the 1929 massacre of the city's Jewish community, Hebron's residents flew white sheets from their windows and rooftops.""
    - Syria entered the war on the assumption that Israel was losing dramatically to Egyptian forces. Nasser exaggerated/lied about Egyptian victory.
    - Dayan, after hearing of the Syrian acceptance of a cease-fire, clears an invasion/occupation on his own into the Golan Heights.
- Conclusion
    - Israel seizes the Gaza Strip and the Sinai Peninsula (from Egypt), the West Bank of the Jordan River, including East Jerusalem (from Jordan), and the Golan Heights (from Syria).
        - Casualties - ~850 Israelis killed, 4,500 wounded. 10k-15k Egyptians killed, 4,300 capture. 700 Jordanian soldiers killed, 2,500 wounded. Syrians lost between 1k-2.5k, and about 450 captured.
    - 1967 Palestinian exodus.
        - 280k-325k Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, mostly resettled in Jordan, the other 700k remained.
        - 100k fled in the Golan Heights.
        - Israel granted full citizenship only to those in East Jerusalem (1967) and the Golan Heights (1981). Most Palestinians in territories declined to take citizenship.
    - Jews immigrating en masse out of the Soviet Union, and Jews leaving en masse from Arab countries (continued from 1948), and Jews leaving en masse from other Communist countries.
