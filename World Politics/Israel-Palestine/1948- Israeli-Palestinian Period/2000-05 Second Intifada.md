## 2000-05 Second Intifada
- [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Intifada)
- Background
    - Violence continued on both sides after the Oslo accords were signed in 1993.
    - Israel engaged in regimental level exercises that were in preparation for peace talks to fail, so it could conquer towns in Area C.
    - The failure of the Camp David Summit lead to a significant fracturing of the PLO as many Fatah factions abandoned it to join Hamas and Islamic Jihad.
    - Netanyahu's government pushed for the construction of a new neighborhood, Har Homa, in East Jerusalem, and continued construction within existing Israeli settlements. Construction in the years following the Oslo Accords was still significantly less than prior, however.
    - Barak secured an agreement for the dismantling of 12 new outposts in 1998, but continued expansion was occurring in existing settlements in the West Bank. This continued to hurt the Palestinian peace process.
- Sharon visits the Temple Mount on September 28th, 2000.
    - Sharon visits the Temple Mount, without stepping inside, but this still angers local Palestinians living in Jerusalem. Violence breaks out.
    - Multiple senior Palestinian officials encouraged Sharon not to visit. Sharon was determined to make a show of Israeli sovereignty over the Temple Mount.
- In 1982, the Kahan Commission found that Ariel Sharon was found to bear personal responsibility for the Sabra and Shatila massacre that occurred against Palestinians in the Lebanese Civil War.
    - Sharon's visit to the Temple Mount 10 days after the annual memorial day for said massacre is said to have been the inciting moment for the beginning of the Second Intifada.
- First days of the intifada
    - Violence broke out heavily in the days following, with losses on the Palestinian side far outweighing Israeli losses.
    - The broadcasted killing of Muhammad al-Durrah, caught by a French news crew, was initially assumed to be the responsibility of the IDF, which they promptly apologized for, though much controversy remains over who actually shot and killed the boy.Â [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUz55tLLXUg&t=1019s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUz55tLLXUg&t=1019s)
