- On 30 March 2018 - 27 December 2019, The Great March of Return Protest were a series of demonstrations held each Friday in the Gaza Strip near the Gaza-Israel border.
- The demonstrators demanded that the Palestinian refugees must be allowed to return to lands they were displaced from in what is now Israel. They protested against Israel's land, air and sea blockade of the Gaza Strip and the United States recognition of Jerusalem as capital of Israel.
    
    - `According to Haniyeh, the protests have so far thwarted US President Donald Trump’s yet-to-be-announced plan for peace in the Middle East and his decision to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.  
    -   
    - The mass demonstrations, he argued, have brought the Palestinian cause back to the world’s attention, “after some tried to bury it through suspicious deals, and reduce it to an issue of bread and electricity.”  
    -   
    - The protests are an uprising for “Jerusalem, Palestine, and the right of return,” he said, referring to the demand that Palestinian refugees and their descendants be allowed to return to their former homes in Israel.  
    -   
    - The Palestinians, Haniyeh said, are waging a “battle for national independence and against racial separation and discrimination. Our people are entitled to dream, and the right of return will be fulfilled. We will return to our Jerusalem and our villages. All our people will return to this blessed land.”`

- The first demonstrations were organized by independent activists, but the initiative was soon endorsed by Ismail Haniya, the leader of Hamas.
    
    - `“This blessed protest is national, peaceful, popular and civilized,” he said.  
    -   
    - Minutes later, though, he called the same protests “a deadly weapon” with which to achieve the Palestinians’ goals, saying that guns, rockets and attack tunnels — the more familiar weapons that have kept Hamas listed as a terrorist group by the United States, European Union and Israel — remained at hand if needed.  
    -   
    - ...  
    -   
    - after a grass-roots idea for a peaceful, long-lasting protest along the Gaza fence started gaining widespread support, Hamas brought a halt to what had been a fairly steady tempo of rocket launches into Israel and threw its considerable organizational might behind the demonstrations.  
    -   
    - By embracing the protests, Hamas cannily aligned itself with a popular movement that became even more popular as it took shape — and that generated an outpouring of international support when Israel responded with gunfire, killing dozens of Palestinians, almost all of them unarmed.`

## Background
**April–May 2021 Ramadan events**
- At the beginning of Ramadan in 2021, Israeli police entered Al-Aqsa Mosque and severed loudspeaker cables used to broadcast the muezzin's ritual call to prayer.
- In the same month, Israeli police closed the staired plaza outside the Old City's Damascus Gate.
- Violent incidents occurred throughout Israel and the West bank, with rockets being fired into Israel from the Gaza strip
**Sheikh Jarrah controversy**
- Apartments in East Jerusalem that were originally on land owned by Arabs (pre 1880's) then Jews (post 1880's) then Arabs (post 1948) then Jews (post 1967) were the subject of dispute when Israeli's attempted to evict Palestinian residents.,
**Political instability**
- Mahmoud Abbas indefinitely postponed the May 22nd 2021 Palestinian legislative elections due to fear of his party, Fatah, losing the upcoming elections, prompting Hamas to resume rocket fire.
## Escalation
- Between May 10th-14th, Israeli security forces injured approximately 1,000 Palestinian protestors in east Jerusalem over Sheikh Jarrah protests that eventually spread to al-Aqsa Mosque, Lod, and other Arab localities in Israel and the West Bank.
**Sheikh Jarrah**
- Israeli settlers and far-right political party members of Otzma Yehudit clashed here.
**Al-Aqsa Mosque compound**
- Police clashed with worshippers at the al-Aqsa compound from May 7th-May 10th.
**West Bank**
- After Friday prayers on May 14th, to May 17th, police and protestors clashed, with protestors protesting in more than 200 locations.
**Arab communities in Israel**
- On May 11th, Netanyahu declared a state of emergency in Lod, marking the first time since 1966 that Israel has used emergency powers over an Arab community.
**Gaza**
- Hamas demand Israel remove all of its police and military from the Haram al Sharif mosque and Sheik Jarrah by May 10th. Once they did not, Hamas fired another 150 rockets into Israel.
- On May 11th, Hamas and PIJ launched hundreds of rockets at Ashdod and Ashkelon.
- On May 14th, Israel launched extensive attacks against Hamas' tunnel networks, killing hundreds of Hamas personnel and assassinated 20 Hamas commanders, as well as destroying most of their rocket production capabilities.
    - Hamas death toll was later revised to dozens, as Hamas commanders doubted the Israeli ruse of reporting a ground invasion.
- By the end of the campaign, over 4,360 rockets and mortar shells had been fired at southern and central Israel.
    - Around 60-70 rockets hit populated areas after the Iron Dome failed to intercept them.
- The IDF killed Hamas militants attempting to use tunnels to cross raid into Israeli territory.
**Lebanon and Syria**
- Several rockets were fired from Syria and Lebanon, with a few Hezbollah members from Lebanon trying to cross into Irsael. Some made it in and set fires near Metulla.

- 13 people in Israel were killed.
- 260 Palestinians were killed, with the UN and HRW saying half of them were civilians.
