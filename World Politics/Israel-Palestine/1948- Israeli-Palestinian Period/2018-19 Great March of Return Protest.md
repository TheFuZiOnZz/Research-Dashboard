- On 30 March 2018 - 27 December 2019, The Great March of Return Protest were a series of demonstrations held each Friday in the Gaza Strip near the Gaza-Israel border.
- The demonstrators demanded that the Palestinian refugees must be allowed to return to lands they were displaced from in what is now Israel. They protested against Israel's land, air and sea blockade of the Gaza Strip and the United States recognition of Jerusalem as capital of Israel.
    
    - `According to Haniyeh, the protests have so far thwarted US President Donald Trump’s yet-to-be-announced plan for peace in the Middle East and his decision to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.  
    -   
    - The mass demonstrations, he argued, have brought the Palestinian cause back to the world’s attention, “after some tried to bury it through suspicious deals, and reduce it to an issue of bread and electricity.”  
    -   
    - The protests are an uprising for “Jerusalem, Palestine, and the right of return,” he said, referring to the demand that Palestinian refugees and their descendants be allowed to return to their former homes in Israel.  
    -   
    - The Palestinians, Haniyeh said, are waging a “battle for national independence and against racial separation and discrimination. Our people are entitled to dream, and the right of return will be fulfilled. We will return to our Jerusalem and our villages. All our people will return to this blessed land.”`  
    - [link](https://www.timesofisrael.com/hamas-vows-gaza-protests-to-continue-until-they-return-to-all-of-palestine/)
    
- The first demonstrations were organized by independent activists, but the initiative was soon endorsed by Ismail Haniya, the leader of Hamas.
    
    - `“This blessed protest is national, peaceful, popular and civilized,” he said.  
    -   
    - Minutes later, though, he called the same protests “a deadly weapon” with which to achieve the Palestinians’ goals, saying that guns, rockets and attack tunnels — the more familiar weapons that have kept Hamas listed as a terrorist group by the United States, European Union and Israel — remained at hand if needed.  
    -   
    - ...  
    -   
    - after a grass-roots idea for a peaceful, long-lasting protest along the Gaza fence started gaining widespread support, Hamas brought a halt to what had been a fairly steady tempo of rocket launches into Israel and threw its considerable organizational might behind the demonstrations.  
    -   
    - By embracing the protests, Hamas cannily aligned itself with a popular movement that became even more popular as it took shape — and that generated an outpouring of international support when Israel responded with gunfire, killing dozens of Palestinians, almost all of them unarmed.`

## Background
**April–May 2021 Ramadan events**
- At the beginning of Ramadan in 2021, Israeli police entered Al-Aqsa Mosque and severed loudspeaker cables used to broadcast the muezzin's ritual call to prayer.
- In the same month, Israeli police closed the staired plaza outside the Old City's Damascus Gate.
- Violent incidents occurred throughout Israel and the West bank, with rockets being fired into Israel from the Gaza strip
**Sheikh Jarrah controversy**
- Apartments in East Jerusalem that were originally on land owned by Arabs (pre 1880's) then Jews (post 1880's) then Arabs (post 1948) then Jews (post 1967) were the subject of dispute when Israeli's attempted to evict Palestinian residents.,
**Political instability**
- Mahmoud Abbas indefinitely postponed the May 22nd 2021 Palestinian legislative elections due to fear of his party, Fatah, losing the upcoming elections, prompting Hamas to resume rocket fire.
## Escalation
- Between May 10th-14th, Israeli security forces injured approximately 1,000 Palestinian protestors in east Jerusalem over Sheikh Jarrah protests that eventually spread to al-Aqsa Mosque, Lod, and other Arab localities in Israel and the West Bank.
**Sheikh Jarrah**
- Israeli settlers and far-right political party members of Otzma Yehudit clashed here.
**Al-Aqsa Mosque compound**
- Police clashed with worshippers at the al-Aqsa compound from May 7th-May 10th.
**West Bank**
- After Friday prayers on May 14th, to May 17th, police and protestors clashed, with protestors protesting in more than 200 locations.
**Arab communities in Israel**
- On May 11th, Netanyahu declared a state of emergency in Lod, marking the first time since 1966 that Israel has used emergency powers over an Arab community.
**Gaza**
- Hamas demand Israel remove all of its police and military from the Haram al Sharif mosque and Sheik Jarrah by May 10th. Once they did not, Hamas fired another 150 rockets into Israel.
- On May 11th, Hamas and PIJ launched hundreds of rockets at Ashdod and Ashkelon.
- On May 14th, Israel launched extensive attacks against Hamas' tunnel networks, killing hundreds of Hamas personnel and assassinated 20 Hamas commanders, as well as destroying most of their rocket production capabilities.
    - Hamas death toll was later revised to dozens, as Hamas commanders doubted the Israeli ruse of reporting a ground invasion.
- By the end of the campaign, over 4,360 rockets and mortar shells had been fired at southern and central Israel.
    - Around 60-70 rockets hit populated areas after the Iron Dome failed to intercept them.
- The IDF killed Hamas militants attempting to use tunnels to cross raid into Israeli territory.
**Lebanon and Syria**
- Several rockets were fired from Syria and Lebanon, with a few Hezbollah members from Lebanon trying to cross into Irsael. Some made it in and set fires near Metulla.
## Casualties and damage
- 13 people in Israel were killed.
- 260 Palestinians were killed, with the UN and HRW saying half of them were civilians.

- Initial impression
    - Border protests spanning 6 months (beginning 30th March 2018), involving 10-30k participants
    - Most participants peaceful and away from the buffer zone
    - Some approach the wall, throwing stones, molotov cocktails, burning tires, launching incendiary kites and balloons (later in the protest) and a small handful armed with rifles
    - Hamas present at the protests, but only a marginal contingency
    - IDF shoots with live fire, using what should be a last resort as a first resort; no real effort at non-lethal crowd control
    - 200+ dead, many of them outside of the buffer zone, most unarmed, only 1 (according to UN analysis through IHL & policing analysis, only 1 was deemed a legitimate threat)
    - Clear disproportionate response to an albeit conceivable threat. Very likely severe crimes committed. No cunt prosecuted.

    - 30 March - 31 December 2018 (focus on 30 March, 14 May and 12 October)
    - Applicable law
        - Israel and Palestine bound by IHL & Israel bound by rules on occupation
    - Context and background
        - Weekly demonstrations near the fence (up since 1996) along the armistice line of 1949
        - Blockade
            - 54% unemployment, 68% rendered food insecure, collective punishment, 2017 UN warning that Gaza would become "unliveable" due to blockade measures
        - Return of refugees
            - 242 affirmed necessity of a "just settlement" of the Palestinian refugee problem
            - Israel opposition to 194, arguing that “the influx of millions of Palestinians into the State of Israel would threaten the existence of Israel as a Jewish state, obliterating its basic identity as the homeland of the Jewish people and a refuge for persecuted Jews worldwide.”
        - 7 Jan 2018, Ahmed Abu Artema posts idea of a non-violent march at the fence
            - “what if 200,000 demonstrators marched peacefully and broke through the fence east of Gaza and entered a few kilometres into the lands that are ours, holding the flags of Palestine and the keys to return, accompanied by international media, and then set up tents inside and established a city there.”
        - National committee and 12 sub-committees established to organise the march
            - Involved members from civil society, student unions, women's groups, eminent persons, representatives from DFLP, Fatah, Hamas, PFLP and PIJ (not al-Qassam or al-Quds brigades)
            - Unifying principle that the march would be "fully peaceful from beginning to end" and demonstrators would be unarmed
            - 5 demonstration sites: northern Gaza, east of Gaza City, central Gaza Strip, east of Khan Younis and Rafah
                - Each camp with tents positioned 700-1000m
    - Israeli preparations and rules of engagement
        - Israeli security mentioned a new security threat in demonstrations, closely linked with armed groups and an attempt to mask "terror activities"
            - Partly based on public statements about return and crossing the fence, including in ambiguous and inflammatory terms
        - Reinforced positions at the fence, more than 100 sharpshooters, leaflets dropped in Gaza + contacting bus companies to warn against participation, strengthening of the fence and underground barrier, barbed wire coils, cleared vegetation, trenches and earth mounds on the Israeli side
        - Live fire ONLY permitted as a last resort in the event of imminent threat to life or limb of Israeli soldiers or civilians; crossing the fence seen as a potential imminent threat, in part because the crowd might include militants
        - Permitted snipers to shoot at the legs of "main inciters" to prevent the crowd from crossing the fence
        - Also permitted lethal force against any demonstrators "directly participating in hostilities"
    - Legal assessment of demonstrations
        - Commission argues that, despite some acts of significant violence, the demonstrations were civilian and "did not constitute combat or a military campaign"
        - It is aware "that the international legal community holds divergent views on whether organised armed group members may be targeted at any time, or only when directly participating in hostilities."
        - Legal framework applied was that of law enforcement, based in IHL
            - Law enforcement rules only permit lethal force in self-defence of the defence of others when there is an imminent threat to life
            - "Owing to the ongoing armed conflict, rules of IHL were also in effect and operated as lex specialis during active hostilities"
            - "An imminent or immediate threat should be understood to mean a matter of seconds, not hours (A/HRC/26/36, para. 59)."
        - Israeli Supreme Court approved rules of engagement, arguing “the use of potentially lethal force for the sake of dispersing a mass riot – from which an actual and imminent danger is posed to life or bodily integrity – is, in principle, permitted, subject to proving necessity and proportionality.”
    - Statistics
        - 189 killed, 183 by live ammunition, 29 members of armed groups that were parties to the conflict with Israel (commission unsure about 18 killed)

        - 21 paralysed, 122 amputations (mostly lower limb)
    - Findings
        - Barring two possible incidents, use of live ammunition was unlawful
        - Less lethal alternatives were available and substantial defences in place, rendering the use of lethal force neither necessary nor proportionate
        - Principle of distinction not met under IHL
        - At least 29 killed were members of armed groups
        - International legal dispute over whether organised armed group members can be targeted at any time
            - Report argues that "in accordance with the law enforcement paradigm as informed by international human rights law and in the absence of arms and active hostiles, the commission concluded that, in this specific context, targeting individuals purely on the basis of their membership of an armed group and not on their conduct at the time was impermissible."
            - All bar 2 were considered not to be directly participating in hostilities (98)
        - Excessive use of force by the ISF against violent demonstrators had violated the rights of thousands who were peaceful
        - Some members of the higher national committee, including Hamas, encouraged or defended use of incendiary kites and balloons; failed to prevent and stop the use of these 'indiscriminate devices'
        - 14th May gunman endangered civilian lives and risked violating principle of distinction
    - Accountability
        - Israel's application of the status of "main inciters" does not exist in international law
        - Or Commission of Inquiry in Israel 2003 determined “it should be made unequivocally clear that firing live ammunition, including sniper fire, is not a means to disperse crowds… This is a means to be used only in special circumstances, such as when there is a real and immediate threat to life…”
        - 5 criminal investigations opened by IDF, including into the deaths of 4 children
- [HRC report full](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/HRBodies/HRC/RegularSessions/Session40/Documents/A_HRC_40_74_CRP2.pdf)
    - Summary
        - Protest civilian in nature, bringing them under a law enforcement legal paradigm
        - ISF conduct also violated IHL which permits civilians to be targeted only when they "directly participate in hostilities." "This purposefully high threshold was not met by demonstrators' conduct... with one possible exception on 14 May."
        - 29 people killed were members of organised armed groups; 18 of undetermined status
            - Commission views it is unlawful to shot a member of an armed group on the basis of membership alone
        - Israeli rules permitted shooting legs of "key inciters/key rioters" (people who burnt tires, cut the fence, lead the crowd)
        - Israel committed war crimes and possibly crimes against humanity
        - Hamas failed to stop incendiary and explosive kites and balloons
    - Applicable law
        - IHRL
            - Israel signs International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) in 1966, comes into force 1992, State of Palestine acceeded to the ICCPR in 2014
            - States can be held internationally responsible for violations occurring inside their territory and outside "if the State exercises jurisdiction there, has effective control, or the actions of the State agents there have significant and foreseeable human rights impacts."
            - 2004 ICJ ruling that Israel's conduct in the OPT must conform to the ICCPR - Israel rejects this
        - Customary international human rights law
            - Arbitrary deprivation of life, freedom from discrimination, torture, inhuman and degrading treatment all form part of customary international human rights law
        - Self-defence under international law
            - States have the right to self defence against an unlawful and imminent (armed) attack
            - Self defence justifies use of necessary and proportional force, including lethal force, if attack is imminent
        - International humanitarian law
            - Both parties to the four Geneva Conventions
                - Palestine acceded to Additional Protocols I and II, Israel has not, but has accepted some provisions as customary international law
                - Palestine acceded to Fourth Hague Convention on the War on Land; Israel has not but does recognise that the regulations reflect customary law
        - Customary international humanitarian law
            - Parties to an armed conflict are bound by customary rules of IHL
            - IHL customary principles and rules are binding upon non-State actors that are party to a conflict so long as they have a measure of organised structure
        - Occupation law
            - “Territory is considered occupied when it is actually placed under the authority of the hostile army. The occupation extends only to the territory where such authority has been established and can be exercised.”
            - Recognised as customary IHL by Israel
            - "Effective control" test
                - Armed forces physically present in the territory of another party, without consent
                - Presence of foreign armed forces displaces the local sovereign authority
                - Foreign forces have established or can readily establish their own authority
            - Was Gaza no longer occupied after 2005?
                - ICRC: "the criteria to be met... should generally mirror the ones used to determine the occupation's beginning"
                    - Departing foreign forces might "retain key elements of authority" which can "amount to effective control"
                - 2009 and 2016, UNSC reaffirmed that Israel retains the status of occupying power in the OPT, including Gaza
                    - Does it? [2009 resolution](http://unscr.com/en/resolutions/doc/1860) refers to a ceasefire during Cast Lead, not a statement on whether or not Israel remained a belligerent occupier after 2005
                    - [2016 resolution](https://www.un.org/webcast/pdfs/SRES2334-2016.pdf) is about settlements and a reaffirming of 242; no mention of Gaza
                    - [GA resolution, Nov 2018](https://www.un.org/unispal/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/A.C.4.73.L.18-1.pdf), might be implying it but seems more like a general condemnation of settlements, blockade, military operations etc.
                    - [Declaration](https://www.un.org/unispal/document/auto-insert-187192/#:~:text=The%20participating%20High%20Contracting%20Parties%20reiterate%20the%20need%20to%20fully,to%20distinguish%20between%20civilians%20and) adopted by Conference of High Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention: "They equally express their deep concern, from an international humanitarian law standpoint, about certain measures taken by the occupying Power in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including the closure of the Gaza Strip."
                    - ICRC 2012: "In the OPT - that is, the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip - the applicable legal framework is the law of belligerent occupation"
                    - Cites the "authoritative pronouncements of the ICJ" but only mentions an advisory opinion on the WB wall from 2004? (67)
        - Existence of an armed conflict
            - During the period, all parties were bound by laws of armed conflict
            - Crimes under international law
                - Armed conflict or occupation is a necessary prerequisite for war crimes
                - "Widespread or systematic attack on a civilian population" is necessary to commit crimes against humanity
                - Crimes against humanity
                    - Three chapeau elements required for CAH
                        1. Individual must commit an inhumane act with requisite criminal intent
                        2. The inhumane act must form part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against civilians
                        3. Attack must be pursuant to, or in furtherance of, a state or organisational policy
                    - Underlying crimes include murder, torture, other inhumane acts and persecution
                    - Widespread means attacks committed on a large scale
                    - "Systematic" refers to "organised nature of the acts of violence and the improbability of their random occurrence"
                    - Systematic nature may be evidence of policy: "It can also be inferred through repeated actions occurring in the same sequence, or the existence of preparations or collective mobilisation orchestrated and coordinated by the State or organisation."
                        - "such a policy may, in exceptional circumstances, be implemented by a deliberate failure to take action, which is consciously aimed at encouraging such attack"
        - Law enforcement paradigm
            - LE paradigm applies in absence of active hostilities e.g. during ceasefires or periods of general calm, and/or where one party is in firm control over an area
                - Also applies during active hostilities
            - Under LE paradigm, state agents may only use force when
                - It serves legitimate LE purpose
                - All possible preventative and precautionary measures have been taken in advance
                - It is strictly necessary
                - It is in proportion to the seriousness of the offence, the risk of harm to others
            - Lethal force
                - Shoot to stop (e.g. limbs) is an extreme measure only resorted to when strictly necessary to protect life or prevent serious injury from an imminent threat
                - Lethal force only allowed where strictly unavoidable in order to protect life from an imminent threat
                    - Not speculative, should mean "a matter of seconds, not hours"
        - IHL: conduct of hostilities paradigm
            - Conduct of hostilities refers to collective resort to means of warfare, including active combat, launching attacks and similar military operations.
            - "When one party's forces engage in military acts designed to undermine the military capabilities of the other, the conduct of hostilities legal paradigm applies. So long as other IHL principles are respected, parties are not barred from targeting, with lethal force, members of an enemy State's armed forces, and civilians who directly participate in hostilites"
        - Fundamental IHL principles related to hostilites
            - Proportionality
                - To target a building or object it must:
                    1. by nature, location, purpose or use, make an effective contribution to military action
                    2. destruction, capture or neutralisation would offer definite military advantage
                - Must verify military objective, choose weapons and timing with a view for avoiding or minimising civilian casualties, issuing advance warnings when feasible
            - Direct participation in hostilities
                - If a civilian directly participates in hostilities, they lose the protection against attack
                - They are targetable on their way to an attack, during the attack and when returning therefrom
                    - After returning, they regain protected status
            - Qualifying conduct
                1. Civilian must (reasonably be expected to) cause harm to enemy forces
                2. Conduct must directly cause harm (indirect causes, or generally supporting the war effort, do not suffice)
                3. The act must be specifically designed to directly cause the threshold of harm in support of a party to conflict and to the detriment of another
                    - DPH is "any hostile act that is specifically designed to support one party to an armed conflict by directly causing - **_on its own or as an integral part of a concrete and coordinated military operation_** - harm to the military operations or military capacity of another party, or death, injury or destruction to persons **_or objects protected against direct attack._**"
            - Continuous Combat Function
                - Person with CCF status is an organised armed group member (otherwise a civilian because they are not in a state military), but their regular function is one of armed combat
                - CCF aims to create parity between states and non-state armed groups (making non-state armed group members targetable outside of hostilities)
                - [Not to be confused with reservists](https://casebook.icrc.org/case-study/icrc-interpretive-guidance-notion-direct-participation-hostilities#:~:text=An%20individual%20recruited%2C%20trained%20and,carries%20out%20a%20hostile%20act.), who are civilians
                - CCF is not in IHL treaties and the concept is unsettled
                - "The Commission believes that during an armed conflict but in situations regulated by the law enforcement paradigm, human rights law prohibits the targeting of individuals in the crowd with lethal force if based purely on their membership in an armed group"
            - Application of legal frameworks ("parallel approach")
                - ICRC: "If enemy fighters were located in the crowd of rioting civilians, they could be directly targeted under IHL rules on the conduct of hostilities. However, their mere presence, or the fact that the fighters launched attacks from the crowd, would not turn the rioting civilians into direct participants in hostilities... If it were to prove too difficult to distinguish the rioting civilians from the fighters, it might be appropriate to deal with the entire situation under law enforcement, and apply an escalation of force procedure with respect to all persons posing a threat."
    - GMR background and principles
        - Ahmed Abu Artema
            - Gazan poet & journalist
            - Jan 7th 2018: _“what if 200,000 demonstrators marched peacefully and broke through the fence east of Gaza and entered a few kilometres into the lands that are ours, holding the flags of Palestine and the keys to return, accompanied by international media, and then set up tents inside and established a city there.”_
            - Believes violence has failed and insisted the protests remain non-violent
            - Advocate of a one state solution for two people: _“on the other side that are calling for the Palestinian right of return too. It is important to strengthen this idea in order to seek to achieve peaceful coexistence based on equality”_
        - Principles of the march
            - Draw attention to resolution 194 and the Palestinian refugees' right to return
            - 12 principles
                - Mostly reiterations of Resolution 194 and non-violent protest
                - "The organisers are keen to... affirm that it is a new form of resistance different to confrontations and throwing stones"
                - "... it is preferable to start a sit-in 700 metres away from the separation fence to prevent the clash of young people with the occupation forces. Progress will be gradual and in accordance with the discretion of hte committees and national bodies in charge, which can be done in stages..."
                - Insistence on no partisan slogans and imagery - only the Palestinian flag and humanitarian slogans in Arabic, English and Hebrew
        - Members of the Higher National Committee
            - HNC and 12 subcommittees with reps from Hamas, Fatah, DFLP, PFLP and PIJ
            - Armed wings not represented
            - Subcommittees for media, elders and honourables, legal, students, popular activity, women, health, refugees, youth, folklore etc (4-15 members)
            - 5 different protest sites along the fence (northern Gaza, east of Gaza City, central Gaza, east of Khan Youis and Rafah)
            - "Return camps" 700-1000 m from the fence; tents named after villages which were abandoned in 1948
            - Jakkar road (built by Hamas in 2015) is around 200-300m from the fence and informally demarcates the no-go zone
            - HNC levelled the ground in areas of sites, organised buses and provided financial support
            - "In accordance with the GMR principles, the activities set up at the return camps encouraged people to attend the GMR while remaining far away from the fence."
            - Sand bags set up ~700m from the fence to protect the tents (subsequently bulldozed by the ISF)
            - Intention to gradually move closer to the fence "as the weeks progressed, at the discretion of the HNC"
            - April 2018, Khaled al-Batsh (senior official of Islamic Jihad - not mentioned in the report), coordinator of the HNC's subcommittees announced moving the tents 50m closer as a first step
        - Communication and media
            - Efforts through lectures and media to preserve the peaceful nature of the protest; no armed police deployed at the sites; policy of no arms
            - "The Commission was told that Hamas security officials checked the protestors for weapons at the entrance of some sites"
            - Facebook page called "Great March of Return" created by Artema and other activists (35,000 followers by early 2019)
                - "The posts reiterate the importance of preserving the peaceful nature of the GMR, while also calling on protesters to cross into Israel on 14 May and providing guidelines for doing so"
        - Participation of women and girls
            - Unique environment for women, allowing them to participate visibly in public events
            - Participated as organisers, journalists, bloggers, demonstrators, paramedics and distributing food and water
            - 3rd July, demonstration called "Women Under Siege"
    - Israel's assessment of the demonstrations
        - Emphasis on Israel's ongoing armed conflict with al-Qassam and al-Quds Brigades and the fact that that Hamas and PIJ were both on the HNC
            - IDF: "by the start of 2018, Hamas' strategic military assets have had their effectiveness curbed by Israeli defences both in the aerial domain and underground"
        - GMR as a security threat
            - IDF saw protests as having been “appropriated by Hamas in order to further its attacks against Israel, to create heightened security tensions in the Gaza arena and to increase political and diplomatic pressure on Israel, internally and internationally”
            - Intention to not allow mass infiltration or to tolerate damage to the fence
            - 100 snipers deployed, primarily from the special forces
            - Israeli warnings to Gazans that Hamas was pressuring them to perform provocative actions; advised that anyone approaching the fence would be endangering their life
            - Description of Hamas turning the area into a "combat zone"
            - Submission to the Supreme Court
                - HNC led by Hamas
                - Plan to infiltrate Israel under the cover of demonstration
                - Risk of "mass infiltration" by a large "incited" crowd that could attack soldiers or civilians living only hundreds of meters from the Strip
                - Risk of a soldier being captured ]
                - Facebook post by Issam Adwan, Jan 16, 2018, “As long as the Palestinians have the spirit of courage and daring, why not breach the border that was set up by the enemy in order to prevent them returning to their occupied lands? Wouldn’t the approaching of thousands of families towards the border confuse the enemy, attract the media to the causes of our people, expose our enemy, revive the region, and encourage our people to dare against the occupying enemy… What will our people lose from the attempt, except for the misery and poverty that they endured in the lands of the refuge?”
                - Haniyeh quotes, April 9th 2018:
                    - _“Here I am emphasizing more and more that the March is peaceful and I hope all the factions and our people understand the aim behind this March, we are leading this March with a lethal weapon, the weapon made of people and masses that we will use to knock over the doors of the occupation forces and open the doors of return and breaking the siege. Yes, at this time we emphasize the peacefulness of the March.”_
                    - _“Our weapons are in our hands, our missiles in our hands, our tunnels are with us and the improvement of our resistance is ongoing by God’s will. This does not contradict that.”_
                    - _“Yes we will break the walls of the blockade, we will remove the occupation entity, and we will return to all of Palestine’s land by God’s will.”_
                - Social media posts ahead of 14 May talking about removing the fence and marching towards Israeli towns near the fence (while maintaining the campaign's peaceful character)
        - Commission's understanding regarding the role of Hamas in the GMR and the three phases
            - As a HNC member, Hamas supported camp infrastructure, coordination and technical/administrative support
            - Since 2014, Hamas had patrolled Jakkar Road and prevented people from reaching the buffer zone, but stopped in Spring 2018 to allow the marches
            - Phase 1 (30 March - 14 May)
                - Characterised as popular festive event; concerts, barbeques, cultural activities and sports games
                - Messages of return understood as symbolic, with no intention to break the fence other than "random and uncoordinated acts by demonstrators' edging towards the fence and returning back"
            - Phase 2 (14 May - early October)
                - Large numbers of killings from May 14th "changed the atmostphere"
                - Fewer families attending
                - Anger over killings and injuries drove youths to more violent acts - incendiary kites, slingshots and incendiary balloons
                - More damage to and breaching of the separation fence
                - Protestors claimed to escalate due to ISF actions; ISF claimed to escalate due to protestors' action
            - Phase 3 (early October - 31 December)
                - Hamas tries to exert more control over the protests
                - Negotiations facilitated by Egypt and UNSCO over fuel deliveries to Gaza from Qatar
                    - Hamas asked to contain demonstrations, and Israel asked to minimise use of firepower
                    - November: Gazans gain 12 hours of electricity per day as opposed to 4 since mid 2017
                - Hamas increase in popularity through WB and Gaza
                    - Waning popularity before protests; violent suppression of peaceful assemblies; ill-treatment and torture; failure of Hamas-Fatah reconciliation
                - Most protestors did not turn up to demonstrate because of a call from Hamas, though they did use the demonstrations as a bargaining chip in negotiations
                - Quote from international Gaza-based observer: "There is a third phase, now. Over the past weeks we’ve seen fewer people injured and killed comparatively. In this third phase, Hamas has shown that they can control the situation, if they want to stop people from going closer to the fence, they can"
        - Israeli preparations ahead of and during the GMR
            - Initial preparation
                - Leaflets in Gaza and warnings to transportation companies not to transport "terrorists" and "violent rioters"
                - Israeli agricultural land cleared on their side of the border
                - Earth mounds or berms built for snipers 30-70m from the fence
                - Barbed wire coils in the ARAs, creating a de-facto no-go zone 20-80m west of the fence
                    - ISF would occasionally enter the strip to repair damage or replace wire coils
                - Sniper units typically consisting of two snipers, a spotter/observer and a senior commander (required to approve use of live ammunition)
            - Less-lethal means
                - Israel stated its use of force against unarmed civilians at the GMR was in accordance with the law-enforcement paradigm
                - Only in exceptional circumstances can more severe means be employed immediately, before less harmful means
                - Level D riot permits loudspeakers, batons, water cannons, skunk water, tear gas launchers, grenades and bullets, stun grenades, paintball guns, 40mm sponge grenades, **_only after_** giving a warning
                    - Skunk water
                        - Water, yeast and sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), sprayed from water cannons
                        - Effective range of 60-70m
                        - Too focused, limited effect when protests are long and can extend for up to two kilometres
                        - Drones are more effective but have shorter range and need periodic refilling
                    - Stun grenade
                        - Bright light and loud sound to temporarily stun crowds; can damage the eardrum; used at least once
                    - Tear gas
                        - Restricted by military and police orders; may only be used to disperse "serious disturbances that endanger public safety"
                        - Allowed under international law for law enforcement but not hostilities
                        - Extensively used in the GMR albeit with problems: tear gas blown back by west-east Gaza breeze; lack of range
                        - Medic statements suggest the gas was incredibly strong
                    - Sponge grenades
                        - Max range 70m, less dangerous than rubber bullets, only permitted when aimed at the lower body (not against children, the elderly or pregnant women)
                    - 37mm rubber-coated metal bullets
                        - Prohibited at less than 40m and against children
                        - Calls within Israel for their prohibition
                        - Only allowed to be directed at the lower body and when visibility is good
                        - Used but not on a large scale because they are insufficient at 70 metres
                    - 0.22 calibre live ammunition (Ruger bullets)
                        - Less lethal than larger calibre ammunition; largely discontinued 2001-08 due to criticism in the Second Intifada
                    - Firearms
                        - IDF ultimately decided to use 7.62 mm ammunition (not 0.22)
                        - Permitted in law enforcement in cases of preventing real danger to life or physical integrity and only after a prior warning
                        - Can be used without warning only in the case of self defence
        - Rules of engagement applied by Israel in the demonstrations
            - IDF statement: “due to the limited effectiveness of various non-lethal means in negating the threats detailed above, the IDF has also been required to use potentially lethal force as a measure of last resort.”
            - Israeli police RoE are public, but IDF RoE is not
            - Law enforcement and laws of armed conflict applied by the IDF side by side
                - "The demonstrations were therefore not seen as “purely civilian”, meaning that any actions of combat/hostilities which might be integrated in the demonstrations would be seen as part of the ongoing armed conflict between Israel and Hamas."
                - Israeli government assertion at the Supreme Court: use of force during the protests were subject to rules of law enforcement with IHL-based "conduct of hostilities" invoked only when the situation called for it
            - Hostilities only applicable “where there are reliable indications that a person is participating in the hostilities (for example, when a person is identified as a member of Hamas’ armed forces, or when a person is engaged in activities amounting to direct participation in hostilities, such as firing at Israeli soldiers)”
            - Accordingly, soldiers authorised to use lethal force "as a last resort in order to address a real and imminent danger to human life or bodily integrity"
            - Israel to the Supreme Court: “For example, when a violent mob reaches the security infrastructure and acts to sabotage it, an imminent threat may exist as a result of the destruction of these defenses and the possibility of infiltrations by violent multitudes of rioters, individuals or operatives.”
            - Permission to shoot at the legs of "key rioters" or "key inciters"
            - Also permits lethal force against civilian protestors who take **direct part in hostilities** or if they are **members of organised armed groups**
                - "Israel does not distinguish in this respect between members who have an actual combat role in the organised armed group and those members who do not possess such a role" - strange characterisation? the [quoted paragraph](https://www.gov.il/BlobFolder/generalpage/operation-protective-edge-full-report/en/English_Terrorism_DOCS_IDFConduct.pdf) (264) makes exceptions for people in protected roles or _hors de combat_
            - Israeli Court declined to view videos presented by petitioners and only assessed compliance with international law on a case-by-case basis
    - Legal assessment of rules of engagement
        - "The Commission agreed with the Government of Israel’s assertion that the two legal paradigms set out previously - the IHRL-based law enforcement paradigm and the IHL-based conduct of hostilities paradigm – applied in parallel to the demonstrations."
        - ISF rules of engagement
            - Israeli Supreme Court treated "key inciter / key rioter" category with caution as it does not exist in IHL or IHRL, but accepted that these rioters were the "_avant garde_ of the imminent threat to life"
            - How key rioters are identified
                - Coordinating tactical placement of burning tires
                - Coordinating people towards pulling back parts of security infrastructure
                - Moving through the crowd whilst talking into a radio; pulling barbed wire coils
                - Inciting the mob
                - Influencing behaviour
                - Providing the conditions for which mass breach or infiltration may occur
                - Breaching infrastructure and attacking the IDF
            - The commission doesn't see this activity as "posing an imminent threat to someone's life"
            - The commission (319) seems to imply that the threshold wouldn't necessarily be met, even if the fence were breached: "Even if the crowd were to cut it and cross, as happened on occasion, normally the crowd would be several dozens of meters away from the nearest IDF soldier and at least 800 meters away from the nearest civilian community. As indicated in the section below, IDF snipers are typically positioned at the top of sand berms or inside armoured personnel carriers, along with other soldiers, armed with automatic weapons and wearing personal protective equipment including body armour and ballistic helmets; the crowd is unarmed. The soldiers’ combined firepower, along with additional mobile forces in the vicinity, would be substantial protection."
            - IDF argues that people can sustain the role of "key instigator/rioter", even as they withdraw to rest before continuing their activity
                - Commission argues (321)
                - that because a 'key inciter' can rest and then resume activity, this undermines the notion that there is an imminent threat to life - but doesn't consider how this applies to people participating in hostilities?
        - Assessment under the law enforcement paradigm
            - Protest sites
                - Abu Safia (North Gaza) site
                    - 30 tents representing different families, clans and tribes
                    - 700-1000 m from the fence
                    - Rolls of barbed wire east of Jakkar road, 50-150m from the fence
                    - ISF berms 50-100m behind the fence (3-4m high)
                    - Fields mostly flattened but still some rugged terrain providing psots for cover
                - Malaka (S-E of Gaza City) site

                    - 15-20 tents, the "Camp of Return"
                    - 700-100m from the fence
                    - Barbed wire 30-50m from the fence (Gazan side)
                    - Berms 20-30m from the fence (Israeli side) with around 5 soldiers each
                - Khan Younis site
                    - 750m from the fence
                    - Barbed wire ~50m from the fence (Gazan side)
                    - Berms 50-100m from the fence (Israeli side)
                - East Rafah site
                    - 1km northwest of Kerem Shalom crossing
                    - Camp ranged 400-700m from the fence at different times
                    - 3-4 sand berms on the Israeli side, 1 on the Gazan side, east of the camp to shield demonstrators
            - Conduct and imminent threat
                - Kites and balloons not seen as constituting imminent threat to civilians
                - Closest civilian community was kibbutz Nahal Oz, 800m from the fence (closer area designated a no-go zone for Israeli civilians)
                - "In addition, kibbutzim neighbouring Gaza are protected with a range of security measures, including high smart perimeter fences, with barbed wire and electronic notification systems. In addition, Israel has substantial forces in the area (including bases and battle tanks that can be deployed to the kibbutzim within minutes, as well as fortified gun towers.)"
            - Throwing stones and other non-explosive objects
                - Stones from 20m could cause injury but not "imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury, especially taking into account ISF's protective equipment"
                - "A demonstrator in the act of slinging a stone or other non-explosive object may pose an imminent threat of serious bodily injury to an ISF soldier, however, not in every case"
            - Burning tyres
                - Tyres used to provide cover for people hurling objects or attempting to damage or breach the fence
                - "The Commission does not find that an individual in the act of burning tyres posed an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury"
            - Incendiary kites
                - Mostly made of plastic and sticks with burning rags or coals fixed to the tail - generally to set fire to Israeli farmland
                - Flying kites does "not pose an imminent threat or serious bodily injury to ISF soldiers or Israeli civilians"
                - "The potential for death and serious bodily injury may exist if individuals fly incendiary kites directly at ISF positions, albeit not in every case... Starting a fire that sweeps across fields may pose a threat of death or serious injury, however, the threat is not imminent."
            - Incendiary balloons
                - Mostly consisting of burning rags or coals carried by balloons or condoms inflated with helium gas; others allegedly with IEDs attached
                - Dangerous or threatening behaviour, but "do not pose an imminent threat to life or serious bodily injury"
            - Cutting coils or the fence
                - Individuals who damaged the fence have crossed, or intended to cross into Israel
                - Damage to a barrier does not create a threat of death or serious injury to individuals on the other side
                - "while a breach to the fence could lead to additional threats to the ISF and Israeli civilians, these additional threats are distinct and must be addressed separately"
                - Damaging the separation fence "does not necessarily pose an imminent threat of death or serious injury"
            - Crossing the fence
                - "The mere act of crossing the separation fence into Israel does not, in itself, pose an imminent threat to life or serious bodily injury"
            - Possession of hand-held cutting weapons and tools
                - "hand-held cutting weapons and tools can be used to kill or cause serious bodily harm to others; however... this threat arises once the individual in possession actually attacks someone"
                - "Mere possession of hand-held cutting weapons and tools, even by individuals who have crossed the fence into Israel, does not pose an imminent threat to life or serious bodily harm"
            - Molotov cocktails
                - Much more dangerous than other IIDs such as lit coals or cloth balls soaked in fuel because the burning liquid of a Molotov can spread instantly
                - "Were demonstrators to throw Molotov cocktails at ISF soldiers at short range, this might pose an imminent threat of death or serious injury"
            - Grenades
                - Claims that some demonstrators threw grenades
                - ISF reports that soldiers were injured by grenades on July 13th and Sept 21st
                - No comments from Israel
                - "A grenade thrown at short range could pose an imminent threat of death or serious injury"
            - Firearms
                - Two instances found of people carrying arms (one pistol and one rifle)
                - "Were a demonstrator to use firearms against the ISF or Israeli citizens, the ISF’s use of lethal force in response to such an imminent threat would be lawful, so long as it was necessary and proportionate."
            - Expert opinion on extreme cases of hostile crowds
                - Cases where there is imminent threat to life and all other measures have been exhausted
                - The commission did not find such extreme circumstances present (377)
                - “In an extreme case where there is a tumultuous and chaotic disturbance created by an assembly of people exhibiting a ferocious degree of violence; where it is genuinely believed that the actions of a large proportion of the people forming the assembly pose an imminent or grave threat to life; and where it is not possible to distinguish between those who do pose that threat and those who do not, it could be argued that the only way to reduce the threat is to disperse the assembly, and that the only way to disperse the assembly is to use firearms.“ On such an occasion it is probable that a number of individuals within the assembly, who are not themselves presenting an imminent or grave threat to life, and who, because of the circumstances cannot be distinguished from those who are posing the threat, would be killed or injured by firearms discharged to disperse the assembly. Furthermore, apart from the impossibility of distinguishing between people who themselves do or do not present the necessary threat to life at any specific instant, the fact of participation in an assembly of people which, collectively, present the threat could be seen as justification under the basic principles, for the use of firearms against them as individuals.”
            - Instances of breaches
                - Videos of groups cutting through the fence, dancing, chanting, praying, throwing stones, kissing the ground, planting flags then returning to Gaza when the ISF approached - the ISF deployed lethal force nonetheless
                - Some groups crossed and committed acts of vandalism or damaged property; one empty sniper position was set on fire; Kerem Shalom crossing installations burned
                - Acts did not seem to occur during protests but at other locations along the fence - outside of the Commission's mandate
                - "The Commission did not ignore the possibility that any individual, or group, may in fact seek to harm, kidnap or even kill an ISF soldier or Israeli citizens beyond. Against the weaponry and defences faced, there was little likelihood of success, but given the history and context, the possibility had to be taken seriously."
            - Legitimate law enforcement objective
                - The commission finds that "defending the separation fence from damage... is a legitimate objective"
                - Necessity
                    - Use of force only permitted when no other way exists to achieve a law enforcement objective - lethal force only necessary when needed to save a life
                    - "where the ISF responded to the crowd of demonstrators approaching the fence with less lethal measures... it averted whatever threat may have existed"
                    - If the ISF could avert threats at the fence without lethal force, it is a fortiori unlawful to shoot a 'main rioter' who emboldens the people making those threats
                    - "Deploying potentially lethal force in order to protect the fence... is per se excessive, as it does not avert an imminent threat to someone's life"
                - Proportionality
                    - Proportionality threshold "sets a maximum on the force that might be used to achieve a specific legitimate objective"
                    - Weapon as harmful as a 7.62 sniper bullet can only be used under Law Enforcement Paradigm if a threat is imminent (moments away and the attacker is close enough to carry it out)
                    - Crowd control typically ineffective beyond 80m - argument that beyond 80 m is not 'imminent' threat
                    - ISD seems to have used lethal force to prevent a threat from 'becoming imminent', as opposed to averting an 'existing threat'
        - IHL-based conduct of hostilities paradigm  
            - Applicable in parallel if someone is actively participating in hostilities and in accordance with:  
            1. Distinction  
            2. Proportionality  
            3. Precautions in attack  
            - Israeli Supreme Court using 'directly participating in the armed conflict', suggesting they equate this with 'directly participating in hostilities'  
            - Report argues that DPH is not status-based, but rather, activity-based (rejection of Continuous Combat Function)  
            - ICRC's Interpretive Guidance: conduct must harm in sufficient measure... "inflict death, injury, or destruction on protected persons or objects"  
            - Commission finds one instance where the threshold of DPH is 'arguably' met: May 14th North Gaza  
            - "Even if it can be argued that persons with a 'continuous combat function'... could be... legitimately targeted at any time... the risk to bystanders is unacceptably high"  
            - Proportionality challenged based partly on 1,576 people being injured by bullet fragmentation or shrapnel
        - Stats
            - 189 killed, 6103 wounded by live ammunition
            - One Israeli soldier killed outside the protest sites
            - 29 either current or former members of Palestinian armed groups party to the conflict (18 people with ambiguous affiliation)
                - "The Commission did not find indications that these armed groups were involved in the organization or staging of violent incidents at the protests, with the possible exception of a 14 May North Gaza incident"

                - Full interview (published June 2nd) has her saying she acted as a "human shield for injured demonstrators"
            - Netanyahu spokesperson, Jun 7th:

Soldiers do not kill women usually – men on the other hand are hunted by Israelis like birds."_ - 26 year-old participant

        - 31% of fatalities (58) were operatives of military wings & 150/187 affiliated with some organisation
    - Militant numbers from Hamas and PIJ both seem to match. As for the affiliates, the report mostly gathers pictures and announcements from various social media pages. Gives dates of posts but no links, making it very difficult to verify the affiliation claims.

    - UN report summary somehow manages to miss every Hamas member in their list of names from March 30th and May 14th. [The full report](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/HRBodies/HRC/RegularSessions/Session40/Documents/A_HRC_40_74_CRP2.pdf) does name some from May 14th but doesn't mention their affiliation:
        - p. 123: "Taher Madhi was a 24-year-old from Al-Shati Refugee Camp. The ISF shot him in the torso at approximately 12 p.m. when he was roughly 300 m from the separation fence. Mahdi had been walking away from the fence towards the Camp of Return when he was shot. He died of lacerations to his internal organs. The Commission finds that Taher did not pose a threat of imminent death or serious injury to ISF soldiers when he was shot."

        - p. 130: "Jihad Al-Faraa was a 29-year-old from Al-Qararah. The ISF soldiers shot him in the neck at the Abasan al-Jadidah protest site. His death was declared at hospital. He was shot after standing for noon prayers in the courtyard of the Camp of Return, about 300 meters from the separation fence."

ISF soldiers shot him in the head with live ammunition around 11 a.m. The bullet caused multiple skull fractures and severe brain laceration. Mo’tassim died at the hospital shortly thereafter. The night before he was shot, he left his home for the demonstration site carrying a toolbox with fence-cutting tools. Before the ISF killed him, Mo’tassim had been injured several times during his participation in the demonstrations, including once with rubber bullet in the leg."

    - Occupied debate things
        - [Hague Regulations 1907](https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/en/ihl-treaties/hague-conv-iv-1907/regulations-art-42?activeTab=undefined) (Art 42): "Territory is considered occupied when it is actually placed under the authority of the hostile army. The occupation extends only to the territory where such authority has been established and can be exercised."
- [ICRC](https://www.icrc.org/en/doc/assets/files/other/icrc-002-0990.pdf): What constitutes "direct participation in hostilities" (p. 46)
    - "hostilities" - collective resort to means and methods of injuring the enemy
    - "participation" - individual involvement of a person in hostilities
        - Conduct that constitutes part of the hostilities is described as 'direct participation' regardless of whether the individual is a civilian or member of armed forces
        - Does not refer to status, function or affiliation, but to their engagement in specific hostile acts
    - Constitutive Elements of Direct Participation in Hostilities
        - Must meet the following criteria:
            1. "the act must be likely to adversely affect the military operations or military capacity of a party to an armed conflict or, alternatively, to inflict death, injury, or destruction on persons or objects protected against direct attack (threshold of harm), and"
            2. "there must be a direct causal link between the act and the harm likely to result either from that act, or from a coordinated military operation of which that act constitutes an integral part (direct causation), and"
            3. "the act must be specifically designed to directly cause the required threshold of harm in support of a party to the conflict and to the detriment of another (belligerent nexus)."
        - Threshold of harm
            - Must be likely to adversely affect the military operations/capacity of a party or, to inflict death, injury or destruction on protected persons/objects
            - Threshold of "likely" harm i.e. harm may be a reasonably expected result of an act
        - Adversely affecting the military operations or military capacity of a party to the conflict
            - "the military operations or military capacity of a party to the conflict can be adversely affected by sabotage and other armed or unarmed activities"
        - Inflicting death, injury or destruction on persons or objects protected against direct attack
            - "In the absence of military harm... a specific act must be likely to cause at least death, injury, or destruction"
            - Building fences, road blocks, interruption of electricity, water or fuel supplies... would not, in the absence of adverse military effects, cause the kind and degree of harm required to qualify as direct participation in hostilities
        - Direct Causation
            - General war effort and war-sustaining activities may result in harm reaching the threshold required for direct participation, others would merely build the capacity to cause such harm
            - Distinction between direct and indirect causation - because "indirect causation" would be too broad and would deprive large parts of the civilian population of their protections
            - Direct causation should be understood as one causal step - not to include research, design, provision of finances, electricity, fuel etc **_unless carried out as an integral part of a specific military operation_**
            - "Only where persons are specifically recruited and trained for the execution of a predetermined hostile act can such activities be regarded as an integral part of that act and, therefore, as direct participation in hostilities" - referring specifically to otherwise indirect acts?
        - Direct causation in collective operations
            - "The standard of direct causation must therefore be interpreted to include conduct that causes harm only in conjunction with other acts" - referring to example of unmanned aerial vehicles (operator, people illuminating the target, data collection, radio operators, overall commander)
        - Causal, temporal and geographic proximity
            - Element of direct causation must be determined by reference to the harm that can reasonably be expected to directly result from a concrete act or operation e.g.
                - Driving an ammunition truck: A civilian truck driver directly transporting ammunition to an active firing position vs transporting from a factory to a port for further shipping to a storehouse (former = direct participation, latter = connection is too remote; would need to be counted as a civilian when assessing proportionality)
                - Voluntary human shields: "Where civilians voluntarily or deliberately position themselves to create a physical obstacle to military operations of a party to the conflict, they could directly cause the threshold of harm required for a qualification as direct participation in hostilities"
                    - Relevant in urban environments where civilians give physical cover to fighting personnel - though in artillery and air attacks, this presence may shift proportionality assessments
                    - Depending on circumstances, voluntary human shields may not always reach the required threshold of harm
        - Belligerent Nexus
            - "An act must be specifically designed to directly cause the required threshold of harm in support of a party to the conflict and to the detriment of another"
            - Belligerent nexus and subjective intent
                - Belligerent nexus is expressed in the design of the act or operation - does not depend on the state of mind of every participant
                - "even civilians forced to directly participate in hostilities or children below the lawful recruitment age may lose protection against direct attack"
                - People forced to act as human shields would remain protected despite the belligerent nexus (subject to proportionality)
            - Important in the following 4 situations:
                - Self-defence against marauding soldiers may cause the required threshold of harm, but clearly does not support a party to the conflict against the other
                - Civilian authorities using force to suppress riots may cause death etc but would not constitute hostilities conducted between parties to an armed conflict
        - Three requirements
            - Threshold of harm, direct causation and belligerent nexus all required for activities to amount to direct participation in hostilities
        - Beginning and end of direct participation in hostilities
        - Preparatory measures
            - Military operations preparatory to an attack, of a specifically military nature, so closely linked to subsequent execution that they already constitute an integral part of the act
            - Preparatory measures aiming to carry out an act vs measures aiming to establish capacity to carry out the act
        - Deployment and return
            - Deployment and return are part of military operation as long as they remain integral to that operation
                - Military withdrawal not to be confused with surrender or _hors de combat_
            - Hostile act ends when the individual had physically separate from the operation and has resumed distinct activities
    - Concept of Civilian in Non-International Armed Conflict
        - Civilians, armed forces and organised armed groups all mutually exclusive categories
        - Article 3, Geneva Convention
            - "Suspension of combat" insufficient for members of organised armed groups
        - State Armed Forces
            - Includes regular armed forces and other armed groups or units organised under a command responsible to the state
            - Membership defined by law and formal integration into permanent units distinguishable by uniforms, insignia and equipment
            - Civilian protection restored when a member is either fully discharged or deactivated as a reservist
        - Organised Armed Group
            - Non-State parties comprise both fighting forces and supportive segments of the civilian population (armed group refers exclusively to the armed or military wing)
            - Elastic nature of membership renders it "particularly difficult to distinguish between a non-State party to the conflict and its armed forces"
            - Membership cannot depend on abstract affiliation, family ties, or other arbitrary criteria
            - Membership must depend on the continuous function of an individual corresponding to the conduct of hostilities on behalf of a non-State party to the conflict
        - "Continuous combat function"
            - Lasting integration into an organised armed group of a non-State party to an armed conflict
            - If recruited, trained and equipped to take part in hostilities, continuous combat function can be assumed even before the first hostile act is carried out
            - Distinguishable from reservists who re-integrate into civilian life after basic training or active membership
            - Supporters or people who accompany an organised armed group, without participating in hostilities, are not members of the group
            - A civilian continuously engaged in hostilities may be seen in a continuous combat function, but not if their participation is spontaneous and sporadic
            - "Presumption of protection in case of doubt"
        - Modalities Governing the Loss of Protection
            - Civilians
            - Protection is lost for exactly as long as the civilian engages in direct participation in hostilities
            - Members of organised armed groups
                - Members cease to be civilians for as long as they remain members by virtue of their continuous combat function
                - "The restriction of loss of protection to the duration of specific hostile acts was designed to respond to spontaneous, sporadic or unorganised hostile acts by civilians and cannot be applied to organised armed groups"
                - Members of armed groups retain 'continuous combat function' because otherwise, it would provide them "with a significant operational advantage over members of State armed forces, who can be attacked on a continuous"
                    - "IHL deprives them of protection against direct attack for as long as they remain members of that group"
                - Disengagement doesn't need to be openly declared - just needs lasting distance from the group and reintegration into civilian life or a non-combat function
            - Precautions and Presumptions in Situations of Doubt
                - Requirement of feasible precautions
                    - Attacks must be suspended if the target is not a legitimate
            - In cases of doubt, an individual must be presumed to be a civilian
                - Standard of doubt is not as strict as that in criminal proceedings, "but rather must reflect the level of certainty that can reasonably be achieved in the circumstances"
                - Factors taken into account include the intelligence available to the decision maker, the urgency of the situation, "and the harm likely to result to the operating forces or to persons and objects protected against direct attack from an erroneous decision"
