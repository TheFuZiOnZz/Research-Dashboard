- On 15 September 2009, a 575-page report by UN inquiry team was released, officially titled "Human Rights in Palestine and Other Occupied Arab Territories: Report of the United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict". It concluded that the IDF and Palestinian armed groups committed war crimes and possibly crimes against humanity.
- The al-Samouni family in the Zeitoun Killings was the most serious attack the Goldstone Report focused on

- On 16 October 2009, the UN Human Rights Council endorsed the report.
    
    - `The Human Rights Council today strongly condemned a host of Israeli measures in the occupied Palestinian territory and called on both sides to implement the recommendations of a United Nations commission that found evidence that Israel and the Palestinians committed serious war crimes in the three-week Gaza war nine months ago.  
    -   
    - The commission, led by Justice Richard Goldstone, recommended that the Security Council require Israel and the relevant Palestinian authorities to launch appropriate independent probes into the alleged crimes, monitor their compliance, and refer the matter to the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) if these did not take place.  
    -   
    - In a resolution, adopted by 25 votes in favour, six against, and 11 abstentions, the Council recommended that the General Assembly consider the Goldstone report during the main part of its current session, requested Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to submit a report on the implementation of its recommendations to the Council in March, and condemned Israel’s refusal to cooperate with the commission.`

- On 28 January 2011, Goldstone gave a speech at Stanford University
    
    - `The extended al-Samouni family had lived for many years in the so-called al-Samouni area of Zeytoun, which is situated south of Gaza City. It is a semi-rural area in which there are a number of houses, some but not all occupied by members of the extended al-Samouni family. On January 4, 2009, members of the Givati Brigade of the IDF decided to take over the house of Saleh al-Samouni as part of the IDF ground operation; they ordered its occupants to relocate to the home of Wa’el al-Samouni. It was located about 35 yards away and within sight of the Israeli soldiers. A request from the family to be allowed to leave the area was refused. Similar demands were made on other members of the al-Samouni family members who were in other houses in the vicinity. In the result there were over 100 members of the family gathered in the single story home of Wa’el al-Samouni.  
    -   
    - Early on the cold wintry morning of 5 January, several male members of the al-Samouni family went outside to gather firewood. They were in clear sight of the Israeli troops. As the men returned with the firewood, projectiles fired from helicopter gunships killed or injured them. Immediately after that further projectiles hit the house. Twenty-one members of the family were killed, some of them young children and women. Nineteen were injured. Of those injured, another eight subsequently died from their injuries. The number of members of the family killed was thus twenty-nine.  
    -   
    - That was the evidence, considered credible and supported by ambulance records and reports given at the time to non-governmental organizations. It led the Fact Finding Mission to conclude that, as a probability, the attack on the al-Samouni family constituted a deliberate attack on civilians. The crucial consideration was that the men, women and children were known by the Israeli troops to be civilians and were ordered by them to relocate to a house that was in the vicinity of their command post. Members of the al-Samouni family had regarded the presence of the IDF as a guarantee of their safety.  
    -   
    - Two inquiries by the Israeli military reported that there was no evidence of unlawful behavior on the part of the Israeli Army with regard to this incident.  
    -   
    - Then, at the end of October 2010, (almost 22 months after the incident), to the credit of the Israeli Military Police, they announced that they were investigating whether the air strike against the al-Samouni home was authorized by a senior Givati brigade commander who had been warned of the danger to civilians.  
    -   
    - At about the same time there were reports that the attack followed upon the receipt of photographs by the Israeli military from a drone showing what was incorrectly interpreted to be a group of men carrying rocket launchers towards a house. The order was given to bomb the men and the building. According to these reports, the photograph received from the drone was not of high quality and in fact showed the men carrying firewood to the al-Samouni home. The results of this military police investigation are as yet unknown.`

- On 18 March 2011, a UN committee report by Mary McGowan Davis was released reconsidering some of the Goldstone Report’s conclusions based on new evidence.

- On 1 April 2011, Goldstone releases and Op-Ed in the Washington Post called `Reconsidering the Goldstone Report on Israel and war crimes`. Goldstone said that based on the new UN committee report by Mary McGowan Davis that the report if written after would have different.
    
    - `We know a lot more today about what happened in the Gaza war of 2008-09 than we did when I chaired the fact-finding mission appointed by the U.N. Human Rights Council that produced what has come to be known as the Goldstone Report. If I had known then what I know now, the Goldstone Report would have been a different document.  
    -   
    - The final report by the U.N. committee of independent experts — chaired by former New York judge Mary McGowan Davis — that followed up on the recommendations of the Goldstone Report has found that “Israel has dedicated significant resources to investigate over 400 allegations of operational misconduct in Gaza” while “the de facto authorities (i.e., Hamas) have not conducted any investigations into the launching of rocket and mortar attacks against Israel.”  
    -   
    - Our report found evidence of potential war crimes and "possibly crimes against humanity" by both Israel and Hamas. That the crimes allegedly committed by Hamas were intentional goes without saying — its rockets were purposefully and indiscriminately aimed at civilian targets.  
    -   
    - The allegations of intentionality by Israel were based on the deaths of and injuries to civilians in situations where our fact-finding mission had no evidence on which to draw any other reasonable conclusion. While the investigations published by the Israeli military and recognized in the U.N. committee’s report have established the validity of some incidents that we investigated in cases involving individual soldiers, they also indicate that civilians were not intentionally targeted as a matter of policy.  
    -   
    - For example, the most serious attack the Goldstone Report focused on was the killing of some 29 members of the al-Simouni family in their home. The shelling of the home was apparently the consequence of an Israeli commander’s erroneous interpretation of a drone image, and an Israeli officer is under investigation for having ordered the attack. While the length of this investigation is frustrating, it appears that an appropriate process is underway, and I am confident that if the officer is found to have been negligent, Israel will respond accordingly. The purpose of these investigations, as I have always said, is to ensure accountability for improper actions, not to second-guess, with the benefit of hindsight, commanders making difficult battlefield decisions.`

- This was widely seen as a retraction of the Goldstone report but was never stated by Goldstone himself as a retraction and no request to withdraw the report was made to the UN.
    
    - `The United Nations Human Rights Council said Monday that it would continue to treat the report written by former Judge Richard Goldstone about Israel's incursion into Gaza as legitimate, despite his recently voiced regret regarding some of his damning allegations.  
    -   
    - A spokesman for the UN rights council said for the report to be withdrawn Goldstone would have to submit a formal request to the Geneva-based body, which he has not done.  
    -   
    - "UN reports are not canceled on the basis of an op-ed in a newspaper," spokesman Cedric Sapey told The Associated Press.  
    -   
    - "Various resolutions passed by the Geneva-based council and the UN General Assembly in New York would also have to be repealed by those bodies," he said.`

- On 14 April 2011, Hina Jilani, Christine Chinkin and Desmond Travers, the three other co-authors of the Goldstone Report released a joint statement criticizing the press’ interpretation of Goldstone’s Op-Ed as a condemnation of the Goldstone Report.
    
    - `In recent days some articles and comments appearing in the press with respect to the report of the United Nations (UN) fact-finding mission on the Gaza conflict of 2008-2009 have misrepresented facts in an attempt to delegitimise the findings of this report and to cast doubts on its credibility.  
    -   
    - The mission that comprised four members, including Justice Richard Goldstone as its chair, came to an end when it presented its report to the UN human rights council in September 2009. The report of the mission is now an official UN document and all actions taken pursuant to its findings and recommendations fall solely within the purview of the United Nations general assembly which, along with the human rights council, reviewed and endorsed it at the end of 2009.  
    -   
    - Aspersions cast on the findings of the report, nevertheless, cannot be left unchallenged. Members of the mission, signatories to this statement, find it necessary to dispel any impression that subsequent developments have rendered any part of the mission's report unsubstantiated, erroneous or inaccurate.`

- On 8 June 2011, Norman Finkelstein released a short book called `Goldstone Recants: Richard Goldstone Renews Israel's License to Kill` in response to the Goldstone Op-Ed.
