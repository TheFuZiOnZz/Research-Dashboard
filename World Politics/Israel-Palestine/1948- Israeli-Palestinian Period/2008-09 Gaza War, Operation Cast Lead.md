- Destiny’s notes
    
    # Background
    
    - Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, and Ariel Sharon, the prime minister of Israel, signed a ceasefire agreement on February 8th, 2005, ending the [The Second Intifada](https://publish.obsidian.md/destiny/Research/History+of+The+Arab-Israeli+Conflict/Events/2000.09.28-2005.02.08+-+The+Second+Intifada).
        - The 13 main Palestinian factions, including Hamas and Islamic Jihad, agreed to be bound by this agreement.
    - Hamas refrained from firing rockets towards for 14 months in accordance with the ceasefire, until IDF naval shelling hit a Gazan beach, killing 7 civilians on June 10th, 2006.
        - Not 100% [sure if this is true](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/palestinian-rocket-and-mortar-attacks-against-israel).
    - In January, 2006, Hamas wins the PA elections, to the chagrin of The Quartet, causing them to condition future assistance on the future government's commitment to nonviolence, recognition of the State of Israel, and acceptance of previous agreemens.
        - Hamas rejects these demands, leading to a US/Israeli supported coup via Fatah that gets pre-empted by Hamas tossing Fatah out of the Gaza Strip.
    - In June 2007, after Hamas' takeover, Israeli imposed a ground, air and maritime blockade.
    - Between 2005 and 2007, Palestinian groups in Gaza fired about 2,700 locally made Qassam rockets into Israel.
    
    ## 2008 six-month ceasefire
    
    - On June 19th, 2008, an Egyptian-brokered six-month "lull" went into effect, but it had no mutually agreed text or enforcement mechanisms and collapsed.
        - The agreement required Hamas to end rocket and mortar attacks, and Israel would stop attacks and military incursions into Gaza, plus ease the blockade of Gaza.
            - Hamas would not agree to stop military buildup in Gaza nor release Corporal Shalit.
        - Israel and Hamas both committed to agreeing to the ceasefire, but on November 4th, 2008, the IDF killed six Palestinians, claiming they were building tunnels to go under the Israeli border to kidnap more Israeli soldiers, which they claimed violated their ceasefire.
    
    ## Implementation
    
    - Hamas attempted to maintain the ceasefire, but could not prevent other rogue groups from firing rockets into Israel from Gaza. Hamas contends that Israel never eased up off the blockade.
    - The UN recorded 7 IDF violations of the ceasefire between June 20th-26th.
    - 9 rockets were fired into Israel in 3 separate violations from the 23rd-26th of June by non-Hamas Palestinian groups.
        - Islamic Jihad reportedly fired these rockets in retaliation for Israeli assassinations of their members in the west bank.
    - Israel did not comply well with the easing of the blockade after the truce was accepted.
        - Is this true? Why not?
    - The Carter Center recorded, based on UN OCHAO data, that the blockade was not eased very much.
    - Israel accused Hamas of continuing to allow rocket fire from the Gaza strip and continued smuggling of weapons.
    - The IDF was accused of continuing to violate the ceasefire agreement, attacking, killing, and bulldozing parts of the Gaza strip despite Hamas adherence to said ceasefire.

    **Tunnel threat**

    # Casualties

    ## Civilians versus combatants

    **Gazan police**

    ## White Phosphorous
    
    - The Goldstone report and Human Rights Watch claimed that Israel used white phosphorous in the conflict, with the latter claiming it was done indiscriminately in a way that would amount to contravention of international law.

    - Professor Newton, an expert in laws of armed conflict testifying in front of a United Nations Fact Finding Mission, criticized a statement by a Hamas brigade commander who said, "The entire people of Gaza are the combatants and therefore, it is appropriate for us to issue warnings and then whether – if, even if they disregard them, to occupy their basement or their house or their backyard."
    - During the Gaza War, Hamas invested great effort in preventing civilians from leaving neighborhoods that were in the line of fire and letting them flee to the south of the Strip.

    # International law
    
    - In April 2012, the International Criminal Court (ICC) rejected the Palestinian Authority's (PA) request that Israel be investigated for claimed war crimes in Gaza in 2009, holding that since the PA is recognized by the UN General Assembly as an "observer" rather than a "state", the ICC lacked jurisdiction to hear its request.
    
    # Media
    
    ## Denied media access
    
    - Reporter access to the war zone was limited. During the Gaza raids against Hamas, the Israeli army denied international media access to the conflict zone, against a decision by the Israeli Supreme Court to lift the embargo.

    - Media facilities in Gaza, both foreign and domestic, came under Israeli fire in the military campaign.
    - On one occasion a Grad rocket may have been launched from a location near the television studios in the Al-Shuruk tower in Gaza City.

    ## New media
    
    - YouTube and other forms of new media became relevant during this conflict.

Israel said the raid was a preemptive strike and Hamas intended to abduct Israeli soldiers.
    
    - `the ceasefire began to founder on 4 November 2008 following an incursion by Israeli soldiers into the Gaza Strip, which Israel stated was to close a cross-border tunnel that in Israel’s view was intended to be used by Palestinian fighters to kidnap Israeli soldiers. The soldiers attacked a house in the Wadi al-Salqa village, east of Deir al-Balah, which was alleged to be the starting point of the tunnel, killing a member of the al-Qassam Brigades. Several Israeli soldiers were wounded.` [link](https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G09/158/66/PDF/G0915866.pdf?OpenElement) - Goldstone Report

The available information indicates that the Golani, Givati and Paratrooper Brigades and five Armoured Corps Brigades were involved. The navy was used in part to shell the Gaza coast during the operations` [link](https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G09/158/66/PDF/G0915866.pdf?OpenElement) - Goldstone Report

    -   
    - ...  
    -   
    - It was no secret that Ms Rice had been on the phone with Washington and with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert all day. This was no run-of-the-mill vote, after all. The call that changed everything apparently came just as ministers and ambassadors were taking their seats in the council chamber. It was President George Bush for Ms Rice. Don't veto the resolution, he said, but don't vote for it either.`
