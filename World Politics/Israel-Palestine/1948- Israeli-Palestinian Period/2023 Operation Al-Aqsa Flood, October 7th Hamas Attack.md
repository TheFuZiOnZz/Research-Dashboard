- On 7 October 2023, Hamas' military wing Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Palestinian Mujahideen Movement and other Popular Resistance Committees launched coordinated armed incursions from the Gaza Strip into the Gaza Envelope of southern Israel, the first invasion of Israeli territory since the [1948 Sirst Arabâ€“Israeli War](1948-49%20War%20of%20Independence,%20First%20Arab-Israeli%20War). The attack coincided with the Jewish religious holiday Simchat Torah. 
- Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups named the attacks Operation Al-Aqsa Flood, while in Israel they are referred to as Black Sabbath or the Simchat Torah Massacre, and internationally as the 7 October attacks.
- According to an IDF report that revised the estimate on the number of attackers, 6000 Gazans breached the border in 119 places and broke into Israel, including 3,800 from the "elite Nukhba forces" and 2,200 civilians and other militants. Additionally, the IDF report estimated 1,000 Gazans fired rockets from the Gaza Strip, bringing the total number of participants on Hamas's side to 7,000.

- 
- 6:30 AM, Hamas commander Mohammed Deif announces the start of Operation Al-Aqsa Flood.
    - Shortly after, Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh made a similar announcement via TV address.
- Within the first 20 minutes, Deif claimed more than 5,000 rockets had been fired. Israeli sources reported the launch of 3,000 projects, killing 5.
- Palestinian militants also opened fire on Israeli boats off the Gaza Strip.
- As the rockets were launching, about 2,900 militants invaded Israel via at least 30 different locations using ground vehicles, speedboats and powered paragliders.
- Multiple massacres unfolded at the Nova music festival, Nir Oz, Be'eri, Netiv HaAsara, Kfar Aza. An amphibious assault was carried out in Zikim, north of Gaza.
- The majority of the attacks were carried out within a few hours, with some holdouts and fighting continuing through October 10th.
- On October 16th, Hamas claimed they were holding 250 hostages and had taken them to force Israel to release Palestinian prisoners.
    - Almost half the hostages were foreign nationals or held multiple citizenships.
- Some of these hostages were handed off to other groups.
- 
- On 20 January 2024, The IDF claimed to have recovered documents illustrating the intent of Palestinian Nationalist fighters entering Israel on October 7th.
	- `The documents indicate that violent attacks on civilians had been planned in advance. Training included careful preparations for attacking shelters to take hostages, stripping them and threatening to kill them while questioning them. The captured documents show profound anti-Semitism coupled with radical Islamist ideology of the type which characterizes extremist organizations such as ISIS and al-Qaeda.` - [Documents brought back from the Gaza Strip indicate that Hamas premeditated its atrocities against Israelis and to kidnap and maltreat them, The Meir Amit Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center, 2024](https://www.terrorism-info.org.il/app/uploads/2024/01/E_020_24.pdf)
	- `Document 1: A hand-written note calling for the brutal murder of Jews`
	  
	  `A handwritten note found in the pocket of a commander of the Izz al-Din Qassam Brigades, Hamas' military wing, who was one of the perpetrators of the terrorist attack and massacre on October 7, 2023. He wrote it for his subordinates before he was killed near the border on the Israel side, and it was apparently written to encourage them before the attack.`
	  
	  `He urges them to kill as many Jews as possible, to behead them and pull out their hearts and livers, as dictated by radical Islamist ideology.`
	  
	  `The note reads: "Allah has purchased [from the believers their lives and their properties in exchange for paradise].2 Oh, descendants of Khaled and al-Zabir , Allah has designated you and given you the honor to participate in jihad so that you can give what you are able and what you want to give. Act well and be faithful to Allah in your intentions, as was the Prophet [Muhammad], who adhered to jihad and was prepared to be killed for its sake. May Allah buy those souls among you who aspire to meet him and see his Prophet, his companions Abu Amara, Sa'd and Khaled [bin al-Walid], and know that your enemy is a disease which has no cure except beheading and removing their hearts and livers. Attack them and take action as the sword of Abu Suleiman took action against them, judge them according to the verdict of Sa'd. In the name of Allah of Khaybar, we begin [the attack] and will strike with the sword of zulfaqar."`
	  
	  `The note propounds radical Islamist ideology and fosters anti-Semitism among Hamas while justifying barbaric, brutal acts and the slaughter of Jews in the name of Islam. The Jews are described as a "disease without a cure" that must be exterminated.` - [Documents brought back from the Gaza Strip indicate that Hamas premeditated its atrocities against Israelis and to kidnap and maltreat them, The Meir Amit Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center, 2024](https://www.terrorism-info.org.il/app/uploads/2024/01/E_020_24.pdf)
	- `Document 2: An Arabic-Hebrew phrasebook`
	  
	  `Among the documents found was an Arabic-Hebrew phrasebook with Hebrew words and phrases transliterated into Arabic characters. The pamphlet was found in the possession of the Jerusalem Battalion of the Izz al-Din Qassam Brigades, Hamas' military wing, and was apparently distributed to terrorists who participated in the October 7, 2023 attack and massacre, who were supposed to use it. Its contents are shocking and testify to the terrorists' intentions and plans, including attacking and humiliating civilians, stealing their vehicles, separating men, women and children, capturing and murdering civilians. Some of the Hebrew phrases are, "Take off your pants," "Where is your weapon?" "I will kill you," "You are a prisoner," "Where is the head of the kibbutz?" "We have hostages," "We will kill the captives," "Where are the car keys?" "Men are here," "Women are here," "The children are here," "Take off your clothes," "Where is the commander?"` - [Documents brought back from the Gaza Strip indicate that Hamas premeditated its atrocities against Israelis and to kidnap and maltreat them, The Meir Amit Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center, 2024](https://www.terrorism-info.org.il/app/uploads/2024/01/E_020_24.pdf)
	- `Document 3: Practice drills for kidnapping civilians`
	  
	  `A document seized by the IDF in one of the Hamas strongholds in the Gaza Strip revealed details of the preparations made by Hamas operatives prior to the terrorist attack and massacre in the cities, towns and villages near the Gaza Strip, indicating that the planning of the attack included locating the shelters to deliberately harm as well as kidnap civilians, including women, children and the elderly. The document includes a follow-up report on a platoon exercise carried out by Hamas operatives in preparation for the massacre as well as a review, apparently written by one of the commanders, about the operatives' performance during the exercise. Among the criticisms it was written,`
	  
	  `In the videos documenting the terrorists' actions in Kibbutz Sufa during the attack and massacre on October 7, 2023, videos taken from the body cameras of Hamas operatives, the terrorists are seen searching for the shelters and calling out each other. "Where are the shelters?" At first they apparently did not understand that the rooms were inside houses, indicating they knew civilians would go to safe rooms and explicitly planned to find, attack and kill them (Israeli TV Channel 12, January 8, 2024).` - [Documents brought back from the Gaza Strip indicate that Hamas premeditated its atrocities against Israelis and to kidnap and maltreat them, The Meir Amit Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center, 2024](https://www.terrorism-info.org.il/app/uploads/2024/01/E_020_24.pdf)
	- `Document 4: Inspirational blessings and prayers for murder`
	  
	  `Hamas' extreme Islamist ideology was evident in another document which was in the possession of Hamas terrorists. It had blessings and prayers which the organization's operatives were required to say in various situations. It contained both the specific circumstance and prayer that the operatives of the Izz al-Din Qassam Brigades had to say. For example:`
	  
	  `Before entering battle they had to say, "Fight them, Allah will torture them through you and bring you victory over them and heal the hearts of the nation of believers."`
	  
	  `When a shaheed was killed they had to say, "Know that the ideal end for a believer is death for the sake of Allah [i.e., in jihad]".`
	  
	  `For a success in battle they had to say, "Blessed be these arms, which defended the land of the homeland and guarded the land, the honor and the holy places from the impurity of the Jews," and, "May Allah protect you, jihad fighters, who with your bravery preserved our honor and raised the flag of victory."` - [Documents brought back from the Gaza Strip indicate that Hamas premeditated its atrocities against Israelis and to kidnap and maltreat them, The Meir Amit Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center, 2024](https://www.terrorism-info.org.il/app/uploads/2024/01/E_020_24.pdf)
- On 21 January 2024, a 16 page report titled "Our Narrative," published in January, Hamas claimed the reasons for the October 7th were the constructions of settlement, the Judaization of the Palestinian lands in the occupied West Bank and Jerusalem, and the killing of thousands of Palestinian civilians from 2000 and onwards.
	- `Operation Al-Aqsa Flood on Oct. 7 targeted the Israeli military sites, and sought to arrest the enemyâ€™s soldiers to pressure on the Israeli authorities to release the thousands of Palestinians held in Israeli jails through a prisoners exchange deal. Therefore, the operation focused on destroying the Israeli armyâ€™s Gaza Division, the Israeli military sites stationed near the Israeli settlements around Gaza.`
	  
	  `Avoiding harm to civilians, especially children, women and elderly people is a religious and moral commitment by all the Al-Qassam Brigadesâ€™ fighters. We reiterate that the Palestinian resistance was fully disciplined and committed to the Islamic values during the operation and that the Palestinian fighters only targeted the occupation soldiers and those who carried weapons against our people. In the meantime, the Palestinian fighters were keen to avoid harming civilians despite the fact that the resistance does not possess precise weapons. In addition, if there was any case of targeting civilians; it happened accidently and in the course of the confrontation with the occupation forces.` - [Our Narrative - Operation Al-Aqsa Flood, Hamas Media Office, 2023](https://www.lbcgroup.tv/uploadImages/ExtImages/Images2/Our%20Narrative-Operation%20Al-Aqsa%20Flood-Web_compressed%20(1).pdf)
- On 4 March 2024, The UN did an investigation related to sexual violence conducted by its own investigators and did not rely on any interrogations nor accounts collected by the Israeli intelligence bodies. Many different factors complicated the identification of sexual violence, including volunteers helping to expedite burial efforts, some misinterpretations of bodies discovered in certain positions, and bodies being burned beyond recognition. Due to the harsh level of scrutiny some survivors received after coming forward, further survivors were hesitant to come forward with their names or specific details attached. Mission report: official visit of the Office of the SRSG-SVC to Israel and the occupied West Bank: 29 January â€“ 14 February 2024
	- `Information received by the mission team indicates that on the morning of 7 October 2023, at about 6:30 AM and under the cover of an unprecedented barrage of rockets, a coordinated attack by Hamas joined by other armed groups, which reportedly included the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Popular Resistance Committees, other armed elements and armed and unarmed civilians, breached the Gaza perimeter fence at multiple points, entered the Gaza periphery and attacked military and civilian targets, including surrounding villages and towns, music festivals and adjacent roads. The complexity and modus operandi of the attacks, which seem to have occurred over three cumulative waves, appear to demonstrate a significant level of planning, coordination and detailed prior knowledge of the targets selected.` - [Mission report: official visit of the Office of the SRSG-SVC to Israel and the occupied West Bank: 29 January â€“ 14 February 2024, Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, 2024](https://news.un.org/en/sites/news.un.org.en/files/atoms/files/Mission_report_of_SRSG_SVC_to_Israel-oWB_29Jan_14_feb_2024.pdf)
	- `The national authorities faced numerous challenges in the collection of evidence and pursuit of their investigations of the crimes committed during the 7 October attacks, including challenges of coordination and information sharing between governmental agencies, with very specific challenges related to crimes of sexual violence These included limited survivor and witness testimony, limited forensic evidence due to the large number of casualties and dispersed crime scenes in a context of persistent hostilities; the loss of potentially valuable evidence due to the interventions of some inadequately trained volunteer first responders; the prioritization of rescue operations and the recovery, identification, and burial of the deceased in accordance with religious practices, over the collection of forensic evidence. Further, a significant number of the recovered bodies had suffered destructive burn damage, which made the identification of potential crimes of sexual violence impossible.` - [Mission report: official visit of the Office of the SRSG-SVC to Israel and the occupied West Bank: 29 January â€“ 14 February 2024, Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, 2024](https://news.un.org/en/sites/news.un.org.en/files/atoms/files/Mission_report_of_SRSG_SVC_to_Israel-oWB_29Jan_14_feb_2024.pdf)
	- `The lack of trust by survivors of the 7 October attacks and families of hostages in national institutions and international organizations, such as the United Nations, as well as the national and international media scrutiny of those who made their accounts public, hindered access to survivors of the attacks, including potential survivors/victims of sexual violence.` - [Mission report: official visit of the Office of the SRSG-SVC to Israel and the occupied West Bank: 29 January â€“ 14 February 2024, Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, 2024](https://news.un.org/en/sites/news.un.org.en/files/atoms/files/Mission_report_of_SRSG_SVC_to_Israel-oWB_29Jan_14_feb_2024.pdf)
