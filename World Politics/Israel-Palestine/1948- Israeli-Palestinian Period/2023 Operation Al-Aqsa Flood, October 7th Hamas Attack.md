- On 7 October 2023, Hamas' military wing Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Palestinian Mujahideen Movement and other Popular Resistance Committees launched coordinated armed incursions from the Gaza Strip into the Gaza Envelope of southern Israel, the first invasion of Israeli territory since the [1948 First Arab–Israeli War](1948-49%20War%20of%20Independence,%20First%20Arab-Israeli%20War). The attack coincided with the Jewish religious holiday Simchat Torah. 
- Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups named the attacks Operation Al-Aqsa Flood, while in Israel they are referred to as Black Sabbath or the Simchat Torah Massacre, and internationally as the 7 October attacks.
- On 7 October 2023, 6:30 AM, the Hamas commander Mohammed Deif announces the start of Operation Al-Aqsa Flood.
	- `"This is the day of the greatest battle to end the last occupation on Earth," Hamas military commander Mohammed Deif said, announcing the start of the operation in a broadcast on Hamas media and calling on Palestinians everywhere to fight.` - [Hundreds dead as war erupts after surprise Hamas attack catches Israel off guard, CBC News, 2023](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/gaza-israel-rockets-attack-hamas-1.6990209)
	- `The leader of Hamas's military wing, Mohammed Deif, said the assault was in response to the 16-year blockade of Gaza and Israeli raids inside West Bank cities over the past year, as well as increasing attacks by settlers on Palestinians and growth of settlements.`
	  
	  `"Enough is enough," Deif, who does not appear in public, said in the recorded message. He said the morning attack was only the start of what he called "Operation Al-Aqsa Storm," and he called on Palestinians from East Jerusalem to northern Israel to join the fight. "Today the people are regaining their revolution."` - [Hundreds dead as war erupts after surprise Hamas attack catches Israel off guard, CBC News, 2023](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/gaza-israel-rockets-attack-hamas-1.6990209)
- Shortly after, Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh made a similar announcement via TV address.
	- `Ismail Haniyeh, the leader of Hamas, said on Saturday that armed Palestinian factions intend to expand the ongoing battle in Gaza to the West Bank and Jerusalem.`
	  
	  `The battle moved into the heart of the “zionist entity,” he said.`
	  
	  `“This was the morning of defeat and humiliation upon our enemy, its soldiers, and its settlers,” he said.`
	  
	  `“What happened reveals the greatness of our preparation. What happened today reveals the weakness of the enemy.”`
	  
	  `He told fellow Arab countries that Israel cannot provide them with any protection despite recent diplomatic rapprochements.`
	  
	  `In a televised speech, Haniyeh addressed the Arab countries that have normalized ties with Israel in recent years.`
	  
	  `“We say to all countries, including our Arab brothers, that this entity, which cannot protect itself in the face of resistors, cannot provide you with any protection,” he said.`
	  
	  `“All the normalization agreements you signed with that entity cannot resolve this (Palestinian) conflict.”` - [Hamas leader Haniyeh: Battle ‘will spread to West Bank, Jerusalem’, Arab News, 2023](https://www.arabnews.com/node/2387276/middle-east) 
- Estimates for forces from Gaza are at 3,800 from Hamas of the estimated 6,000 which crossed the border.
	- `New assessments indicate twice as many Gazans breached the border into Israel on October 7 than previously believed, Channel 12 reported Saturday, citing data compiled by the Israel Defense Forces’ Gaza Division.`
	  
	  `Some 3,800 terrorists from the Hamas terror group’s elite Nukhba forces smashed through the border fence, the report said, among a total of 6,000 Gazans who crossed into Israel that day.`
	  
	  `Hitherto, figures made public indicated that some 3,000 Hamas-led terrorists participated in the invasion, massacre and hostage-taking that day. That number did not take into account Gazans who crossed the fence and participated in the atrocities but were not Hamas members, nor did it differentiate between Nukhba terrorists and other Hamas terrorists.`
	  
	  `It was unclear from the report what the status was of the 2,200 other Gazans who infiltrated Israel on October 7. Presumably, many were civilians, as extensive footage of the onslaught showed many enter to loot and take part in the assault, while others were likely members of other Hamas units or other terrorist organizations such as the Palestinian Islamic Jihad.`
	  
	  `The TV report also said that the border was breached in 119 spots — again, about double the previously widely cited figure of 60 breaches in the Gaza-Israel fence.`
	  
	  `Additionally, 1,000 terrorists inside Gaza were involved in firing rockets at Israel that day, the report said, meaning that a total of some 7,000 Gazans took part in the onslaught.`
	  
	  `Some 5,000 rockets were fired at Israel on October 7, with 3,000 of them in the first four hours of the onslaught, according to the IDF.`
	  
	  `Channel 12 said the data was submitted to IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi.`
	  
	  `In response to the report, Channel 12 quoted the IDF Spokesman’s Office as saying that the IDF’s operational probe of the events surrounding October 7 has not yet been completed, and is continuing in accordance with situational assessments and operational needs.`
	  
	  `Upon completion, the findings will be made public, the spokesman’s office said.`
	  
	  `The October 7 massacre saw terrorists kill some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and kidnap 251, all while committing widespread atrocities and mass sexual assault. Over 350 people were killed at a music festival and whole families were executed in their homes.` - [Report: New IDF assessment shows some 6,000 Gazans invaded Israel on Oct. 7, The Times of Israel, 2024](https://www.timesofisrael.com/report-new-idf-assessment-shows-some-6000-gazans-invaded-israel-on-oct-7/)
- On 20 January 2024, The IDF claimed to have recovered documents illustrating the intent of Palestinian Nationalist fighters entering Israel on October 7th.
	- `The documents indicate that violent attacks on civilians had been planned in advance. Training included careful preparations for attacking shelters to take hostages, stripping them and threatening to kill them while questioning them. The captured documents show profound anti-Semitism coupled with radical Islamist ideology of the type which characterizes extremist organizations such as ISIS and al-Qaeda.` - [Documents brought back from the Gaza Strip indicate that Hamas premeditated its atrocities against Israelis and to kidnap and maltreat them, The Meir Amit Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center, 2024](https://www.terrorism-info.org.il/app/uploads/2024/01/E_020_24.pdf)
	- `Document 1: A hand-written note calling for the brutal murder of Jews`
	  
	  `A handwritten note found in the pocket of a commander of the Izz al-Din Qassam Brigades, Hamas' military wing, who was one of the perpetrators of the terrorist attack and massacre on October 7, 2023. He wrote it for his subordinates before he was killed near the border on the Israel side, and it was apparently written to encourage them before the attack.`
	  
	  `He urges them to kill as many Jews as possible, to behead them and pull out their hearts and livers, as dictated by radical Islamist ideology.`
	  
	  `The note reads: "Allah has purchased [from the believers their lives and their properties in exchange for paradise].2 Oh, descendants of Khaled and al-Zabir , Allah has designated you and given you the honor to participate in jihad so that you can give what you are able and what you want to give. Act well and be faithful to Allah in your intentions, as was the Prophet [Muhammad], who adhered to jihad and was prepared to be killed for its sake. May Allah buy those souls among you who aspire to meet him and see his Prophet, his companions Abu Amara, Sa'd and Khaled [bin al-Walid], and know that your enemy is a disease which has no cure except beheading and removing their hearts and livers. Attack them and take action as the sword of Abu Suleiman took action against them, judge them according to the verdict of Sa'd. In the name of Allah of Khaybar, we begin [the attack] and will strike with the sword of zulfaqar."`
	  
	  `The note propounds radical Islamist ideology and fosters anti-Semitism among Hamas while justifying barbaric, brutal acts and the slaughter of Jews in the name of Islam. The Jews are described as a "disease without a cure" that must be exterminated.` - [Documents brought back from the Gaza Strip indicate that Hamas premeditated its atrocities against Israelis and to kidnap and maltreat them, The Meir Amit Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center, 2024](https://www.terrorism-info.org.il/app/uploads/2024/01/E_020_24.pdf)
	- `Document 2: An Arabic-Hebrew phrasebook`
	  
	  `Among the documents found was an Arabic-Hebrew phrasebook with Hebrew words and phrases transliterated into Arabic characters. The pamphlet was found in the possession of the Jerusalem Battalion of the Izz al-Din Qassam Brigades, Hamas' military wing, and was apparently distributed to terrorists who participated in the October 7, 2023 attack and massacre, who were supposed to use it. Its contents are shocking and testify to the terrorists' intentions and plans, including attacking and humiliating civilians, stealing their vehicles, separating men, women and children, capturing and murdering civilians. Some of the Hebrew phrases are, "Take off your pants," "Where is your weapon?" "I will kill you," "You are a prisoner," "Where is the head of the kibbutz?" "We have hostages," "We will kill the captives," "Where are the car keys?" "Men are here," "Women are here," "The children are here," "Take off your clothes," "Where is the commander?"` - [Documents brought back from the Gaza Strip indicate that Hamas premeditated its atrocities against Israelis and to kidnap and maltreat them, The Meir Amit Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center, 2024](https://www.terrorism-info.org.il/app/uploads/2024/01/E_020_24.pdf)
	- `Document 3: Practice drills for kidnapping civilians`
	  
	  `A document seized by the IDF in one of the Hamas strongholds in the Gaza Strip revealed details of the preparations made by Hamas operatives prior to the terrorist attack and massacre in the cities, towns and villages near the Gaza Strip, indicating that the planning of the attack included locating the shelters to deliberately harm as well as kidnap civilians, including women, children and the elderly. The document includes a follow-up report on a platoon exercise carried out by Hamas operatives in preparation for the massacre as well as a review, apparently written by one of the commanders, about the operatives' performance during the exercise. Among the criticisms it was written,`
	  
	  `In the videos documenting the terrorists' actions in Kibbutz Sufa during the attack and massacre on October 7, 2023, videos taken from the body cameras of Hamas operatives, the terrorists are seen searching for the shelters and calling out each other. "Where are the shelters?" At first they apparently did not understand that the rooms were inside houses, indicating they knew civilians would go to safe rooms and explicitly planned to find, attack and kill them (Israeli TV Channel 12, January 8, 2024).` - [Documents brought back from the Gaza Strip indicate that Hamas premeditated its atrocities against Israelis and to kidnap and maltreat them, The Meir Amit Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center, 2024](https://www.terrorism-info.org.il/app/uploads/2024/01/E_020_24.pdf)
	- `Document 4: Inspirational blessings and prayers for murder`
	  
	  `Hamas' extreme Islamist ideology was evident in another document which was in the possession of Hamas terrorists. It had blessings and prayers which the organization's operatives were required to say in various situations. It contained both the specific circumstance and prayer that the operatives of the Izz al-Din Qassam Brigades had to say. For example:`
	  
	  `Before entering battle they had to say, "Fight them, Allah will torture them through you and bring you victory over them and heal the hearts of the nation of believers."`
	  
	  `When a shaheed was killed they had to say, "Know that the ideal end for a believer is death for the sake of Allah [i.e., in jihad]".`
	  
	  `For a success in battle they had to say, "Blessed be these arms, which defended the land of the homeland and guarded the land, the honor and the holy places from the impurity of the Jews," and, "May Allah protect you, jihad fighters, who with your bravery preserved our honor and raised the flag of victory."` - [Documents brought back from the Gaza Strip indicate that Hamas premeditated its atrocities against Israelis and to kidnap and maltreat them, The Meir Amit Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center, 2024](https://www.terrorism-info.org.il/app/uploads/2024/01/E_020_24.pdf)
- On 21 January 2024, a 16 page report titled "Our Narrative," published in January, Hamas claimed the reasons for the October 7th were the constructions of settlement, the Judaization of the Palestinian lands in the occupied West Bank and Jerusalem, and the killing of thousands of Palestinian civilians from 2000 and onwards.
	- `Operation Al-Aqsa Flood on Oct. 7 targeted the Israeli military sites, and sought to arrest the enemy’s soldiers to pressure on the Israeli authorities to release the thousands of Palestinians held in Israeli jails through a prisoners exchange deal. Therefore, the operation focused on destroying the Israeli army’s Gaza Division, the Israeli military sites stationed near the Israeli settlements around Gaza.`
	  
	  `Avoiding harm to civilians, especially children, women and elderly people is a religious and moral commitment by all the Al-Qassam Brigades’ fighters. We reiterate that the Palestinian resistance was fully disciplined and committed to the Islamic values during the operation and that the Palestinian fighters only targeted the occupation soldiers and those who carried weapons against our people. In the meantime, the Palestinian fighters were keen to avoid harming civilians despite the fact that the resistance does not possess precise weapons. In addition, if there was any case of targeting civilians; it happened accidently and in the course of the confrontation with the occupation forces. Since its establishment in 1987, the Hamas Movement committed itself to avoiding harm to civilians. After Zionist criminal Baruch Goldstein in 1994 committed a massacre against Palestinian worshippers in the Al-Ibrahimi Mosque in occupied Hebron City, the Hamas Movement announced an initiative to avoid civilians the brunt of fighting by all parties, but the Israeli occupation rejected it and even did not give any comment on it. The Hamas Movement also repeated such calls several times, but received by a deaf ear from the Israeli occupation which continued its deliberate targeting and killing of Palestinian civilians.` - [Our Narrative - Operation Al-Aqsa Flood, Hamas Media Office, 2023](https://www.lbcgroup.tv/uploadImages/ExtImages/Images2/Our%20Narrative-Operation%20Al-Aqsa%20Flood-Web_compressed%20(1).pdf)
- On 4 March 2024, The UN did an investigation related to sexual violence conducted by its own investigators and did not rely on any interrogations nor accounts collected by the Israeli intelligence bodies. Many different factors complicated the identification of sexual violence, including volunteers helping to expedite burial efforts, some misinterpretations of bodies discovered in certain positions, and bodies being burned beyond recognition. Due to the harsh level of scrutiny some survivors received after coming forward, further survivors were hesitant to come forward with their names or specific details attached. Mission report: official visit of the Office of the SRSG-SVC to Israel and the occupied West Bank: 29 January – 14 February 2024
	- `Information received by the mission team indicates that on the morning of 7 October 2023, at about 6:30 AM and under the cover of an unprecedented barrage of rockets, a coordinated attack by Hamas joined by other armed groups, which reportedly included the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Popular Resistance Committees, other armed elements and armed and unarmed civilians, breached the Gaza perimeter fence at multiple points, entered the Gaza periphery and attacked military and civilian targets, including surrounding villages and towns, music festivals and adjacent roads. The complexity and modus operandi of the attacks, which seem to have occurred over three cumulative waves, appear to demonstrate a significant level of planning, coordination and detailed prior knowledge of the targets selected.` - [Mission report: official visit of the Office of the SRSG-SVC to Israel and the occupied West Bank: 29 January – 14 February 2024, Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, 2024](https://news.un.org/en/sites/news.un.org.en/files/atoms/files/Mission_report_of_SRSG_SVC_to_Israel-oWB_29Jan_14_feb_2024.pdf)
	- `The national authorities faced numerous challenges in the collection of evidence and pursuit of their investigations of the crimes committed during the 7 October attacks, including challenges of coordination and information sharing between governmental agencies, with very specific challenges related to crimes of sexual violence These included limited survivor and witness testimony, limited forensic evidence due to the large number of casualties and dispersed crime scenes in a context of persistent hostilities; the loss of potentially valuable evidence due to the interventions of some inadequately trained volunteer first responders; the prioritization of rescue operations and the recovery, identification, and burial of the deceased in accordance with religious practices, over the collection of forensic evidence. Further, a significant number of the recovered bodies had suffered destructive burn damage, which made the identification of potential crimes of sexual violence impossible.` - [Mission report: official visit of the Office of the SRSG-SVC to Israel and the occupied West Bank: 29 January – 14 February 2024, Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, 2024](https://news.un.org/en/sites/news.un.org.en/files/atoms/files/Mission_report_of_SRSG_SVC_to_Israel-oWB_29Jan_14_feb_2024.pdf)
	- `The lack of trust by survivors of the 7 October attacks and families of hostages in national institutions and international organizations, such as the United Nations, as well as the national and international media scrutiny of those who made their accounts public, hindered access to survivors of the attacks, including potential survivors/victims of sexual violence.` - [Mission report: official visit of the Office of the SRSG-SVC to Israel and the occupied West Bank: 29 January – 14 February 2024, Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, 2024](https://news.un.org/en/sites/news.un.org.en/files/atoms/files/Mission_report_of_SRSG_SVC_to_Israel-oWB_29Jan_14_feb_2024.pdf)
	- `Based on the information gathered by the mission team from multiple and independent sources, there are reasonable grounds to believe that conflict-related sexual violence occurred during the 7 October attacks in multiple locations across Gaza periphery, including rape and gang rape, in at least three locations. Across the various locations of the 7 October attacks, the mission team found that several fully naked or partially naked bodies from the waist down were recovered – mostly women – with hands tied and shot multiple times, often in the head. Although circumstantial, such a pattern of undressing and restraining of victims may be indicative of some forms of sexual violence.` - [Mission report: official visit of the Office of the SRSG-SVC to Israel and the occupied West Bank: 29 January – 14 February 2024, Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, 2024](https://news.un.org/en/sites/news.un.org.en/files/atoms/files/Mission_report_of_SRSG_SVC_to_Israel-oWB_29Jan_14_feb_2024.pdf)
	- `At the Nova music festival and its surroundings, there are reasonable grounds to believe that multiple incidents of sexual violence took place with victims being subjected to rape and/or gang rape and then killed or killed while being raped. Credible sources described finding murdered individuals, mostly women, whose bodies were naked from their waist down – and some totally naked – tied with their hands behind their backs, many of whom were shot in the head. On Road 232, credible information based on witness accounts describe an incident of the rape of two women by armed elements. Other reported instances of rape could not be verified in the time allotted. The mission team also found a pattern of bound naked or partially naked bodies from the waist down, in some cases tied to structures including trees and poles, along Road 232. In kibbutz Re’im, the mission team further verified an incident of the rape of a woman outside of a bomb shelter and heard of other allegations of rape that could not yet be verified.` - [Mission report: official visit of the Office of the SRSG-SVC to Israel and the occupied West Bank: 29 January – 14 February 2024, Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, 2024](https://news.un.org/en/sites/news.un.org.en/files/atoms/files/Mission_report_of_SRSG_SVC_to_Israel-oWB_29Jan_14_feb_2024.pdf)
