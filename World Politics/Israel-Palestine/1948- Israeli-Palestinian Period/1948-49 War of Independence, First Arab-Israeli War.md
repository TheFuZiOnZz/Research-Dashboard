- 
- War had two main phases, the first began on November 30th, 1947.
    - First phase mainly fought between Jewish and Palestinian Arab militias, supported by the Arab Liberation Army and the surrounding Arab states. Escalated at the end of March 1948, when Jews went on the offensive.
- After Arabs fled Haifa, Jaffa and Jerusalem, the US pulled out of the Partition Plan while the British supported the annexation of the Arab part of Palestine by Transjordan.
- Funds raised by Golda Meir and Stalin's support allowed Israel to [purchase weapons from Eastern Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_shipments_from_Czechoslovakia_to_Israel_1947%E2%80%931949).
- May 14th, 1948, the last British troops and personnel departed Haifa, and the Jewish leadership declared the establishment of the state of Israel.
- Second phase of the war began in May of 1948, the Arab-Israeli War, when invasion happens after Jewish leadership declares independence.
    - Invading countries were Egypt, Iraq, Transjordan and Syria, supported by the Arab Liberation Army and corps of volunteers from Saudi Arabia, Lebanon and Yemen
- Plan Dalet
    - Forced expulsion and control of areas that extended beyond the proposed partition borders. Some (Zionists) claim that this was a defensive action to secure the future safety and borders of the new country, Israel, others claim this was purely an offensive territorial conquest aimed to ethnically cleanse the surrounding lands of Arabs to make it fertile for future Jews to settle.
- In 1949, Israel signed separate Armistice agreements with Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan and Syria to establish [these](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f4/Palestine_Military_Situation%2C_April_6%2C_1949%2C_Truman_Papers.jpg) temporary military borders.

        - Also allowed to take over positions previously held by Iraqi forces.
    - Syria maintained 66 square kilometers in the Jordan Valley, designated as DMZs.
    - Iraq had no formal agreement as they withdrew their forces.
    - The new military borders, as set by the agreements, encompassed about 78% of Mandatory Palestine.
- Israel lost 6,373 people (4,000 soldiers), about 1% of its population. The exact number of Arab losses is estimated between 4,000 and 15,000.
- Over 700,000 displaced Palestinians that fled or were expelled from their land as a result.
- Over 700,000 Jews exodus from Arab and Muslim lands in the 3 years following the war, fleeing into Israel.

	- `The immediate trigger of the 1948 War was the November 1947 UN partition resolution. The Zionist movement, except for its fringes, accepted the proposal. Most lamented the imperative of giving up the historic heartland of Judaism, Judea and Samaria (the West Bank), with East Jerusalem’s Old City and Temple Mount at its core; and many were troubled by the inclusion in the prospective Jewish state of a large Arab minority. But the movement, with Ben-Gurion and Weizmann at the helm, said “yes.”`  - [1948: A History of the First Arab-Israeli War, Benny Morris](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/bafykbzaceboh6eehlb6m6qeyfzcadyiri4vhj3syboxaidhido32jriuuaj3c?filename=Benny%20Morris%20-%201948_%20A%20History%20of%20the%20First%20Arab-Israeli%20War-Yale%20University%20Press%20%282008%29.pdf)

	- `In November 1947, days before the eruption of hostilities, General Ismail Safwat, head of the Arab League Military Committee, wrote: “Victory over the Jews—who are well trained and well equipped—by gangs and irregular forces alone is not feasible. So regular forces must be thrown into the battle, trained and equipped with the best weaponry....Asthe Arab states do not have sufficient means for a protracted war, everything must be done so that the war in Palestine will be terminated in the shortest possible time.” As the months passed and the Palestinian Arabs, beefed up by contingents of foreign volunteers, proved incapable of defeating the Yishuv, the Arab leaders began more seriously to contemplate sending in their armies. The events of April 1948—Deir Yassin, Tiberias, Haifa, Jaffa—rattled and focused their minds, and the arrival of tens of thousands of refugees drove home the urgency of direct intervention. By the end of April, they decided to invade. The following fortnight saw the leaders and their generals trying to hammer out agreed objectives, a coordinated strategy, and a unified command structure. They failed.`  - [1948: A History of the First Arab-Israeli War, Benny Morris](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/bafykbzaceboh6eehlb6m6qeyfzcadyiri4vhj3syboxaidhido32jriuuaj3c?filename=Benny%20Morris%20-%201948_%20A%20History%20of%20the%20First%20Arab-Israeli%20War-Yale%20University%20Press%20%282008%29.pdf)
