- Lead-up
    - After the 1967 6-day war, the Israeli government voted to return captured territory to Syria and Egypt in exchange for peace and demilitarization, but these proposals were never proven to have been transmitted to either Arab state.
    - In the Khartoum Arab Summit, Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq, Algeria, Kuwait and Sudan all agreed to the "three no's," no peace, no recognition and no negotiation with Israel.
    - The War of Attrition takes place from 1967-1970, across the Egyptian and Jordanian borders, including both their militaries and the PLO, with Arafat coming to the head of the PLO in 1969.
    - in December of 1970 in an article to the New York Times, Anwar Sadat agreed to recognize Israel as an independent state in exchange for a full withdrawal from the Sinai Peninsula along with other occupied Arab territories.
    - Golda Meir put together a committee to examine the Egyptian peace proposal, but rejected said proposal feeling as though it would not ensure Israel's security, despite the committee unanimously concluding that Israel's interests would be served.
    - US was supplying Israel with military force since the 1960's and considered it an ally during the Cold War.
    - [Resolution 242](https://peacemaker.un.org/sites/peacemaker.un.org/files/SCRes242%281967%29.pdf) called for Israel to abandon all of its 6-day war territorial gains and for every state in the region to have an official recognition of their boundaries and right to exist.
    - In October of 1972, facing mounting domestic pressure, Sadat declared his intention to go to war against Israel, even absent Soviet support.
    - In February of 1973, Sadat made a final peace overture towards Israel via Kissinger, which Meir rejected, most likely with the understanding that war was invetiable.
    - Israel did not think war was coming, despite multiple repeated credible warnings, including a warning from King Hussein himself.
- Israeli Preparation
    - Meir, the Chief of General Staff, opted not to attack Syria hours before the war began because he recognized the importance for not being blamed as starting any conflict in order to recruit American or other international assistance.
    - Kissinger and Nixon warned Meir not to begin a pre-emptive war.
- Battle in the Sinai
    - October 6th was the initial attacks from Egyptian aircraft.
    - The US held back on supplies for Israel in order to encourage them to accept a ceasefire once hostilities began, but Sadat refused. The Soviets began supplying arms to Egypt and Syria while the US then resumed supplying arms to Israel.
    - Israel refrained from attacking economic and strategic infrastructure in response to Egyptian threats to fire Scud missiles onto Israeli cities.
    - Israel managed to set up bridges and break through to the other end of the Suez canal, pushing into Egypt.
- Ceasefire
    - On October 22nd, 1973, the UNSC passed a 14-0 resolution calling for a ceasefire, negotiated mainly between the US and the USSR.
    - For the first time, three Scud Missiles were fired at Israeli targets by either Egyptian forces or Soviet personnel in Egypt, which was the first combat use of Scud Missiles. All three targets were in the Sinai.
    - Ceasefire claims to have been broken by both sides during the night, and Israel capitalized on the ceasefire break to advance beyond the UNSC ceasefire lines.
- Egypt's Third Army
    - The US, seeing an opportunity to bring Egypt closer to its sphere of influence, exerted heavy pressure on Israel to refrain from destroying the trapped Third Army.
        - Kissinger told the Israeli ambassador, Simcha Dinitz, that the destroying of the Egyptian Third Army "is an option that does not exist."
- Post-war Battles
    - The ceasefire wasn't followed closely by either side, with the fighting not stopping until January 18th, 1974.
    - The Israeli Army was 100 km from Cairo after their advancement from the west bank.
- Initial Syrian Attacks
    - The Syrians began their attacks with an airstrike against Israeli positions in the Golan Heights.
    - Syrians pushed Israeli military lines back to the Southern Golan Heights.
    - Dayan discussed the possible arming of nuclear weapons in response to Syrian military gains. Meir rejected this option. Syrian mechanized brigades did not advance into Israel as they had feared an Israel nuclear response.
    - Missiles from Syrian offensive lines struck civilian settlements in Israel, and in retaliation, seven Israeli F-4 Phantoms flew into Syria and attacked the Syrian General Staff Headquarters in Damascus.

    - Egyptian missile boats bombarded Israeli positions on the Sinai coast on the first day of the war. Israeli missile boats decisively won these battles at sea.
    - Two Egyptian destroyers enforced a blockade, preventing oil from Iran being shipped to Israel through the straights of Bab-el-Mandeb.
- Participation by other states
    - The US intelligence community, including the CIA, failed to predict the Egyptian-Syrian attack on Israel.
    - Most officials in the Defense and Statement Departments opposed financing Israel, but Kissinger argued heavily in favor of supporting Israel so they would confirm to American views in postwar diplomacy.
    - Meir authorized the assembly of thirteen 20-kiloton-TNT tactical nuclear weapons for Jericho missiles, done in an easily detectable way to signal to the United States. This was done on the 8-9th of October after previously rejecting this idea on the 7th.
    - On the 9th of October, after Kissinger learned of the nuclear alert, Nixon ordered the beginning of Operation Nickel Grass.
        - The US, over 32 days, airlifted 22,325 tons of tanks, artillery and ammunition to Israel.
        - In later interviews, Kissinger, Schlesinger and William Quandt suggested that the nuclear aspect was not a major factor influencing re-supply. They cite Soviet re-supply efforts and Sadat's rejection of early ceasefires as being the primary motivators.
    - The Soviet Union supplied around 80,000 tons of supplies, mainly to Syria, and also to Egypt.

    - In Syria, a Soviet cultural center in Damascus and a merchant ship, _Ilya Mechnikov_, was sunk by the Israeli Navy.
    - This all occurred during the apex of the Watergate Scandal. Nixon was so agitated and discomposed that there were times with Kissinger and Haif didn't bother to wake him for consultation.
    - Arab countries added up to 100,000 troops to Egypt and Syria's frontline ranks.
        - Algeria, East Germany, North Korean, Pakistan, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Morocco, Tunisia, Lebanon and Sudan all sent forces, ammo, tanks, pilots, etc...
