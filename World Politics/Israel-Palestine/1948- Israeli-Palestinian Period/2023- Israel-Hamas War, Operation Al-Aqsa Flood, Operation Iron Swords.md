# Location 

- The Gaza Strip, The Gaza Envelope, Israel

# Causes 

- The attacks had likely been planned for over a year before they were executed.
- In a 16 page report titled "Our Narrative," published in January, Hamas claimed the reasons for the October 7th were the constructions of settlement, the Judaization of the Palestinian lands in the occupied West Bank and Jerusalem, and the killing of thousands of Palestinian civilians from 2000 and onwards.

# Events 

## October 7th Assault 

- 6:30 AM, Hamas commander Mohammed Deif announces the start of Operation Al-Aqsa Flood.
    - Shortly after, Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh made a similar announcement via TV address.
- Within the first 20 minutes, Deif claimed more than 5,000 rockets had been fired. Israeli sources reported the launch of 3,000 projects, killing 5.
- Palestinian militants also opened fire on Israeli boats off the Gaza Strip.
- As the rockets were launching, about 2,900 militants invaded Israel via at least 30 different locations using ground vehicles, speedboats and powered paragliders.
- Multiple massacres unfolded at the Nova music festival, Nir Oz, Be'eri, Netiv HaAsara, Kfar Aza. An amphibious assault was carried out in Zikim, north of Gaza.
- The majority of the attacks were carried out within a few hours, with some holdouts and fighting continuing through October 10th.

### Bombing of the Al-Ahli Hospital (parking lot) 

1. On October 17th, multiple media outlets ([Al Jazeera](https://web.archive.org/web/20231017204908/https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2023/10/17/photos-an-israeli-air-raid-on-al-ahli-arab-hospital-kills-an-estimated-500) claiming 500 dead, Jeremy Bowen on [BBC News](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7T9ZnT-gC4) claiming a huge explosion that appeared like an Israeli airstrike, [Channel 4](https://www.mediaite.com/uk/channel-4-news-israel-evidence-gaza-hospital/) claiming the Israeli explanation of a PIJ rocket misfire didn't make sense. [NYT](https://web.archive.org/web/20231017190254/https://www.nytimes.com/)) reported that some 500 people were killed when Israel bombed al-Ahli Hospital.
2. Upon further analysis of the strike, a crater in the parking lot of the hospital showed that the hospital was clearly not destroyed and the strike was highly unlikely to come from an Israeli missile. Human Rights Watch [published](https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/11/26/gaza-findings-october-17-al-ahli-hospital-explosion) on November 26th, 2023 that the explosion was likely from a Palestinian armed group and questioned the unusual death count reported by Hamas for the attack.
    
    Gaza: Findings on October 17 al-Ahli Hospital Explosion
    
    - Human Rights Watch, November 26th, 2023
    
    At 6:59 p.m. that day, a type of munition that Human Rights Watch has not been able to conclusively identify hit a paved area inside the hospital compound, between a parking lot and a landscaped area where many civilians congregated to seek safety from [Israeli](https://www.hrw.org/middle-east/north-africa/israel/palestine) strikes. The Ministry of Health in Gaza [reported](https://www.facebook.com/MOHGaza1994/posts/pfbid02VihLzssMVKvwphaoxK71rs9X4fUtNFaXBj9nFamjZ4Z9A56Vu6SZ7GcTLS2yo23fl?__cft__%5b0%5d=AZVcCVXpbVsZ1zqtGl7rOpF5IiDnWRzE6J9XbCedSBlg8uOIdQ9n8qjf_ukt2-Bq2c06804G65UCqnR5RBsK9XBclOwirjOf9HBvwa0BYkHbjQRHnA2lJMS0gOGO8C1SHnAKH-6Y444FV4XbXrLh7VhMRjFkwJNW6A3RMw8OGJBaVw&__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R) that 471 people were killed and 342 injured. Human Rights Watch was unable to corroborate the count, which is significantly higher than [other](https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/19/politics/us-intelligence-assessment-gaza-hospital-blast/index.html) [estimates](https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-france-intelligence-7be0d59b9ceb58bbf2f03c5dc8222356), displays an unusually high killed-to-injured ratio, and appears out of proportion with the damage visible on site.  
    ...  
    Human Rights Watch [investigated](https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/10/11/real-or-fake-verifying-video-evidence-israel-and-palestine) the explosion by reviewing publicly available photos and videos, analyzing satellite imagery, interviewing five witnesses to the incident and its aftermath, reviewing analyses published by other organizations, and consulting experts. The remote analysis assessed the explosion and the damage on site, as well as several possible trajectories of the objects visible on videos taken at the time of the attack, which also showed the moments before and after the explosion at the hospital.  
    ...  
    However, the sound preceding the explosion, the fireball that accompanied it, the size of the resulting crater, the type of splatter adjoining it, and the type and pattern of fragmentation visible around the crater are all consistent with the impact of a rocket.
    
    Evidence available to Human Rights Watch makes the possibility of a large air-dropped bomb, such as those Israel has used extensively in Gaza, highly unlikely. The Israeli military has dropped thousands of such bombs across the Gaza Strip since October 7.
    
    A Hamas official [said](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2023/10/26/gaza-hospital-blast-evidence-israel-hamas/) the remnants would “soon be shown to the world.” More than a month after the events, this has not happened. Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas leader and deputy minister in the Hamas-led Gaza governing authority, [told](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/22/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-hospital-evidence.html) the media on October 22 that “the missile has dissolved like salt in the water.… It’s vaporized. Nothing is left.” Human Rights Watch noted that substantial portions of munitions typically survive a detonation, even if parts of munitions are designed to break apart and may be made unrecognizable by thermal damage.
    

### Israel bombing "safe zones" 

1. Many publications (the [UNCHR](https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2023/10/israel-must-rescind-evacuation-order-northern-gaza-and-comply-international#:~:text=A%20UN%20expert%20today%20demanded%20that%20Israel%20immediately%20rescind%20its%20order%20for%201.1%20million%20Palestinians%20to%20leave%20northern%20Gaza%20within%2024%20hours%2C%20condemning%20the%20evacuation%20order%20as%20a%20crime%20against%20humanity%20and%20a%20blatant%20violation%20of%20international%20humanitarian%20law.), [HRW](https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/10/16/why-israels-gaza-evacuation-order-so-alarming#:~:text=On%20Friday%2C%20the%20Israeli%20army,for%20the%20safety%20of%20civilians.), [PBS](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/israel-orders-evacuation-of-1-million-in-northern-gaza-in-24-hours), [DOHA news](https://dohanews.co/un-calls-on-israel-to-rescind-impossible-24-hour-evacuation-order-for-1-million-palestinians/), [VOA News](https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-to-un-northern-gaza-should-evacuate-within-24-hours/7309227.html)) suggested that Israel was ordering civilians to flee in only 24 hours, an impossible task given the number of people (over 1 million) that needed to flee northern Gaza.
    1. This seems to originate from [a statement](https://press.un.org/en/2023/db231013.doc.htm) published by the UN from Spokesman for the Secretary-General Stéphane Dujarric.
2. Many have also suggested that Israel has engaged in bombing "safe zones" by bombing southern Gaza after directing civilians to flee there.

- On October 13th, Israel warned some 1.1 civilians to flee northern Gaza via airdropped pamphlets from the IAF, and messages across social media in both Arabic and English.
- Despite claims to the contrary, there is no evidence that a 24 hour warning was actually ever officially given. Significant ground military operations in Gaza didn't actually occur until the 27th of October, 2023.
- There have not been any mutually agreed upon "safe zones" established in the Gaza Strip as Hamas has never made any attempt to assist Israel with establishing said zones. The only official safe zone that Israel [has declared](https://www.idf.il/en/mini-sites/idf-press-releases-regarding-the-hamas-israel-war/october-23-pr/idf-calls-residents-of-gaza-to-evacuate-to-humanitarian-area-in-al-mawasi-where-international-humanitarian-aid-will-be-provided/) exempt from attack is Al-Mawasi on October 18th.
- The IDF [has claimed](https://twitter.com/IDF/status/1733542164091523324?lang=en) multiple times that Hamas has fired dozens of rockets, many of which fail, multiple times from Al-Mawasi, as early as December 9th.
- On January 4th, Hamas claimed that an Israeli air-strike killed 14 people in a house in Al-Mawasi. Despite this claim, there appears to be no pictures, video evidence nor any other type of information relating to this strike, which is odd, given that this area has been declared a permanent safe zone by Israel.

### Reduction in necessary food and medical supplies 

1. Many claim that a dramatic reduction in trucks going into the Gaza Strip means that an insufficient amount of humanitarian supplies (food, water, medicine, fuel) are making it into the Gaza Strip. Some put forth stronger claims that this reduction has been intentionally done by Israel to collectively punish the Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip.
2. Multiple claims have been made about Gazans facing widespread famine or imminent starvation.

- The "500 trucks a day" figure includes things like construction materials, which have been severely restricted by Israel during the war.
- The amount of food that has been going into the Gaza Strip over the past three months has been higher than any amount of food delivery in history of the Gaza strip, [according to](https://www.ochaopt.org/data/crossings) the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
- The issues Palestinians in Gaza are facing right now are likely ones of distribution. Humanitarian aid is reaching the other side of the crossings into the Strip, but distribution is difficult for several reasons, including a lack of workers and drivers, a lack of people willing to serve as security forces for aid after recent strikes, accusations of Hamas stealing aid, and lack of safe routes deeper into northern Gaza.
- As of April 1st, 32 people have starved to death, using [the most favorable source](https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/04/09/gaza-israels-imposed-starvation-deadly-children#:~:text=Gaza's%20Health%20Ministry%20reported%20as,and%20disease%20of%2027%20children.) of Hamas' Gazan Health Ministry.

# Hostages 

- On October 16th, Hamas claimed they were holding 250 hostages and had taken them to force Israel to release Palestinian prisoners.
    - Almost half the hostages were foreign nationals or held multiple citizenships.
- Some of these hostages were handed off to other groups.

## Intent to Harm Civilians 

- The IDF claimed to have recovered documents illustrating the intent of Palestinian fighters entering Israel on October 7th. 5

Documents brought back from the Gaza Strip indicate that Hamas premeditated its atrocities against Israelis and to kidnap and maltreat them

## Sexual Violence 

- There is strong evidence indicating widespread sexual violence occurred during the October 7th attacks. 2
- The UN did an investigation related to sexual violence conducted by its own investigators and did not rely on any interrogations nor accounts collected by the Israeli intelligence bodies.
- Many different factors complicated the identification of sexual violence, including volunteers helping to expedite burial efforts, some misinterpretations of bodies discovered in certain positions, and bodies being burned beyond recognition.
- Due to the harsh level of scrutiny some survivors received after coming forward, further survivors were hesitant to come forward with their names or specific details attached.

Mission report : official visit of the Office of the SRSG-SVC to Israel and the occupied West Bank : 29 January – 14 February 2024

- On April 25th, "Screams Before Silence" was released, where at least two different women detailed sexual violence they had been subjected to, with Agam Goldstein claiming that half the female hostages she came into contact with had been subjected to some sort of sexual violence.

## Casualty Number Revisions 

- Due to the badly charred bodies, Israel began revising casualty counts after identifying some as Hamas fighters.

## "40 behead babies" 

# Outcome 

- In response to these October 7th attacks, Israel launched [Operation Swords of Iron](https://publish.obsidian.md/destiny/Research/Library/Events/2023.10.07-ongoing+-+Israel-Hamas+War) and began the largest ever incursion into the Gaza Strip to eliminate Hamas and rescue the captured Israeli hostages.

# Important Notes 

1. This was the largest terrorist attack in the history of Israel, and the largest single-day casualty event in Jewish history since the Holocaust.
2. This attack had likely been planned for at least a year in advance, likely with significant help from Iran.
3. This attack was the inciting moment for the ensuing [2023.10.07-ongoing - Israel-Hamas War](https://publish.obsidian.md/destiny/Research/Library/Events/2023.10.07-ongoing+-+Israel-Hamas+War).
