	- `The first quasi-political Palestinian nationalist organizations can be traced to the last months of World War I. In November 1918, veteran Jaffa notables established a local "Muslim-Christian Association" (MCA). Similar MCAs, later all loosely connected, were established—often with clandestine help from British officers—in the following months in other towns. The MCAs, while not defining themselves as political organizations, articulated local political thinking and aspirations, generally espousing self-rule and opposing Zionism, and expressed themselves in posters and petitions to the British administration. Christians were disproportionately represented, perhaps because they were better educated and more advanced politically, perhaps because they felt a greater need to collaborate with others. (In 1931 literacy among Muslims was about 14 percent, compared with 58 percent among Christians.)`  - [Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-2001, Benny Morris](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/bafykbzaced6rtb5d4wthw3wapbnqafd3w7znfmikvzx43dqifs5amzbyzltas?filename=Righteous%20Victims%3A%20A%20History%20of%20the%20Zionist-Arab%20Conflict%2C%20--%20Benny%20Morris%20--%202001%20--%20Vintage%20--%209780679744757%20--%200ffdde5f35058146403a55786f6cfc18%20--%20Anna%E2%80%99s%20Archive.pdf)
