- On 3 January 1919, The Faisal–Weizmann agreement was signed by Emir Faisal, the third son of Hussein ibn Ali al-Hashimi, King of the short-lived Kingdom of Hejaz, and Chaim Weizmann, President of the Zionist Organization. Signed two weeks before the start of the Paris Peace Conference, it was presented by the Zionist delegation alongside a March 1919 letter written by T. E. Lawrence in Faisal's name to American Zionist leader Felix Frankfurter as two documents to argue that the Zionist plans for Palestine had prior approval of Arabs.
- It seemed that Weizmann and Faisal had initial strides for their respective movements to be cooperative with each other implying some sort of two-state solution.
    - `Weizmann appeared to have done well with Faisal, but their agreement was to prove as ephemeral and insignificant as a dune in a desert storm. The entente was to have only a few months of dubious life. The two men met for a second time on December n at the Carlton Hotel in London, after the Hashemite prince had been installed in Damascus and a month before the opening of the Peace Conference in Paris. A temporary alliance of the two nationalisms striving for postwar Western support was seen as mutually beneficial. Colonel Lawrence served as interpreter. Faisal reassured his guest that "he and his followers would be able to explain to the Arabs that the advent of the Jews into Palestine was for the good of the country, and that the legitimate interests of the Arab peasants would in no way be interfered with." According to Weizmann, Faisal felt that there was land enough for both Jews and Arabs.`
      
      `Weizmann expected Faisal and the Peace Conference to "recognize the national and historical rights of Jews to Palestine;" that land would be made available for Jewish colonization, so that "four or five million Jews" could settle "without encroaching on the ownership rights of Arab peasantry;" and that Palestinian Jewry would assist Faisal in his own national endeavor. Faisal assured Weizmann that "he would do everything to support Jewish demands, and would declare at the Peace Conference that Zionism and the Arab movement were fellow movements ... [and in] harmony."` - [Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-2001, Benny Morris](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/bafykbzaced6rtb5d4wthw3wapbnqafd3w7znfmikvzx43dqifs5amzbyzltas?filename=Righteous%20Victims%3A%20A%20History%20of%20the%20Zionist-Arab%20Conflict%2C%20--%20Benny%20Morris%20--%202001%20--%20Vintage%20--%209780679744757%20--%200ffdde5f35058146403a55786f6cfc18%20--%20Anna%E2%80%99s%20Archive.pdf)
- This cooperation was formalised into the Feisal-Weizmann Agreement which stated that the [1917 Balfour Declaration](../1517-1917%20Ottoman%20Period/1917%20Balfour%20Declaration) should be respected and that Arabs could work along side them
    - `On January 3, 1919, Weizmann and Faisal signed a formal agreement. Referring to the "racial kinship and ancient bonds" between Jews and Arabs, and "to the emergent "Arab State" and Palestine as two distinct entities, the agreement asserted:
      
      `In the establishment of the Constitution and Administration of Palestine all such measures shall be adopted as will afford the fullest guarantees for carrying into effect the British Government's Declaration of the 2nd of November, 1917 [i.e., the Balfour Declaration]. Moreover, all necessary measures shall be taken to encourage and stimulate immigration of Jews into Palestine on a large scale, and as quickly as possible to settle Jewish immigrants upon the land.... In taking such measures, the Arab peasant and tenant farmers shall be protected in their rights, and shall be assisted in forwarding their economic development
      
      `(It is worth noting that while Zionist advocates, both before and after the Weizmann-Faisal agreement, continuously harped upon the favorable economic effect of Jewish colonization on the Palestinian Arabs, not much had changed for the latter between 1882 and 1920. According to Leonard Stein, legal adviser to the Zionist Organization, writing in August 1921, "Little Jewish capital [had] entered the country and ... there [had] been no conspicuous quickening of economic life. Zionist activity [had] not put enough money into the pockets of the Arabs to make any appreciable impression on their minds.")` - [Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-2001, Benny Morris](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/bafykbzaced6rtb5d4wthw3wapbnqafd3w7znfmikvzx43dqifs5amzbyzltas?filename=Righteous%20Victims%3A%20A%20History%20of%20the%20Zionist-Arab%20Conflict%2C%20--%20Benny%20Morris%20--%202001%20--%20Vintage%20--%209780679744757%20--%200ffdde5f35058146403a55786f6cfc18%20--%20Anna%E2%80%99s%20Archive.pdf)
