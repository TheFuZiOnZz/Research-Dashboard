- On 1 December 1918, The Clemenceauâ€“Lloyd George Agreement was a verbal agreement that modified the [[Israel-Palestine Contents Page]] in respect to Palestine and the Mosul Vilayet. The latter component is also known as the Mosul Cession. The agreement was between British and French Prime Ministers David Lloyd George and Georges Clemenceau and took place at the French Embassy in London.
- Clemenceau visited London, a few weeks after the [[Israel-Palestine Contents Page]], and Lloyd George managed to get him to agree to hand over Palestine and Mosul to Britain, despite the terms of Sykes-Picot. This new arrangement was never put into writing but Lloyd George revealed it in his memoir.
    - `When Clemenceau came to London after the War I drove with him to the French Embassy through cheering crowds who acclaimed him with enthusiasm. After we reached the Embassy he asked me what it was I specially wanted from the French. I instantly replied that I wanted Mosul attached to Irak, and Palestine from Dan to Beersheba under British control. Without any hesitation he agreed. Although that agreement was not reduced into writing, he adhered to it honourably in subsequent negotiations.` [The Truth About The Peace Treaties, David Lloyd George](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.523826/page/n308/mode/1up)
