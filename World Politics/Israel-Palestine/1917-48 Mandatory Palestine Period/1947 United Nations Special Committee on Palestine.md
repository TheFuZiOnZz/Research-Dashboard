- On 15 May 1947 - 3 September 1947, The United Nations Special Committee on Palestine (UNSCOP) was created in response to a United Kingdom government request that the General Assembly "make recommendations under article 10 of the Charter, concerning the future government of Palestine". The British government had also recommended the establishment of a special committee to prepare a report for the General Assembly. The General Assembly adopted the recommendation to set up the UNSCOP to investigate the cause of the conflict in Palestine, and, if possible, devise a solution. UNSCOP was made up of representatives of 11 countries. UNSCOP visited Palestine and gathered testimony from Zionist organisations in Palestine and in the US.
- On 10 July 1947, after the Chairman of the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine appealed to The Arab Higher Committees full co-operation, they boycotted the commission, explaining that the Palestinian Arabs' natural rights were self-evident and could not continue to be subject to investigation, but rather deserved to be recognized on the basis of the principles of the United Nations Charter.

	- `Appeal for full co-operation broadcast by the Chairman of the Special Committee`
      
      `Broadcast from the Palestine Broadcasting Service Studio in English at 1.30 p. m., 16 June 1947`
      
      `The members of the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine are now here and the Committee, which I note from the press is referred to locally as UNSCOP, will get down to work immediately.`
      
      ` I would emphasize that the eleven-member group of which I have the honour to be Chair-man is a special committee of the General Assembly of the United Nations created for the sole purpose of reporting to it on the Palestine question and submitting such proposals as it may consider appropriate for the solution of the problem of Palestine. In the achievement of this purpose, the duty of the Committee here, in the time available to it, is to learn all that it possibly can about this country and its people. To that end the Committee earnestly hopes for full co-operation in its task from all elements in the population.`
      
      `I cannot put it too strongly that this Commit-tee has come to Palestine with a completely open mind. Our membership represents eleven different countries elected by the General Assembly, no one of which has any direct concern with the Palestine question, but each of which shares the general concern for its equitable solution. We are impartial on this problem and we intend to make an impartial report to the General Assembly. We cone without bias. We have reached no conclusions in advance and we will reach none until we are in possession of the necessary information. Indeed, the work of this Committee begins here.`
      
      ` I may say also that we are under no illusions. We are fully aware of the difficult nature of our mission. We are here to learn, and from what we learn we shall draw our own conclusions. We wish those conclusions to be based on the fullest possible knowledge and consideration of all the relevant facts and it would be regrettable indeed if any part of that information were not to be available to us in the framing of our conclusions.`
      
      ` In this connection, I would call attention to our Press Release No. 1 of 4 June 1947, before our arrival here, in which all organizations or persons so desiring were urged to prepare for the Committee at the earliest possible date written statements setting forth their views. Persons wishing to be heard orally were also invited to submit in writing their request for hearing. We repeat that invitation. Written testimony and requests for oral hearings should be ad-dressed to me as Chairman of UNSCOP, c/o the Secretariat, Y.M.C.A. Building, Jerusalem.`
      
      `We trust that this invitation will be received in the spirit in which it has been extended. We seek here information only, as the essential basis for our conclusions and we sincerely trust that all parties concerned will willingly and in good spirit provide us with it.` - [Question of Palestine/Partition recommendation – UN Special Committee on Palestine (UNSCOP) – Report Addendum 1 (Annexes, Appendix and Maps)](https://www.un.org/unispal/document/auto-insert-186346/)

      `"The Arab Higher Committee, after discussing the renewed invitation of the Chairman of the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine for the full co-operation of the Arab Higher Committee, finds no reason for reversing its previous decision submitted to the Secretary-General of the United Nations on 13 June 1947."` - [Question of Palestine/Partition recommendation – UN Special Committee on Palestine (UNSCOP) – Report Addendum 1 (Annexes, Appendix and Maps)](https://www.un.org/unispal/document/auto-insert-186346/)
- On 3 September 1947, The report of the committee dated 3 September 1947 supported the termination of the British Mandate in Palestine. It contained a majority proposal for a Plan of Partition into two independent states with Economic Union and a minority proposal for a Plan for one Federal union with Jerusalem as its capital. This formed the basis for the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine.
    - `It is recommended that`
      
      `The Mandate for Palestine shall be terminated at the earliest practicable date.`
      
      `Among the reasons for this unanimous conclusion are the following:`
      
      `(a) All directly interested parties-the mandatory Power, Arabs and Jews-are in full accord that there is urgent need for a change in the status of Palestine. The mandatory Power has officially informed the Committee "that the Mandate has proved to be unworkable in practice, and that the obligations undertaken to the two communities in Palestine have been shown to be irreconcilable". Both Arabs and Jews urge the termination of the mandate and the grant of independence to Palestine, although they are in vigorous disagreement as to the form that independence should take.`
      
      `(b) The outstanding feature of the Palestine situation today is found in the clash between' Jews and the mandatory Power on the one hand, and on the other the tension prevailing between Arabs and Jews. This conflict situation, which finds expression partly in an open breach between the organized Jewish community and the Administration and partly in organized terrorism and acts of violence, has steadily grown more intense and takes as its toll an ever-increasing loss of life and destruction of property.`
      
      `(c) In the nature of the case, the Mandate implied only a temporary tutelage for Palestine. The terms of the Mandate include provisions which have proved contradictory in their practical application.` - [Question of Palestine/Majority plan (Partition), Minority plan (Federal State)- UN Special Committee on Palestine (UNSCOP) – Report](https://www.un.org/unispal/document/auto-insert-179435/)
