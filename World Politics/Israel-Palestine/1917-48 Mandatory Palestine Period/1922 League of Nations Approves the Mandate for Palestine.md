- On 24 July 1922, The Palestine mandate was approved at a private meeting of the Council of the League of Nations at St. James Palace in London giving the British formal international recognition of the position they had held de facto in the region since the end of 1917 in Palestine and since 1920â€“21 in Transjordan.
    - `On 24 July 1922, in a session held at St. James Palace in London, the Council of the League of Nations finally gave its approval to the British Mandate in Palestine. This decision climaxed a long, arduous struggle on the part of the British to gain formal international recognition of their suzerainty in the Holy Land, which had existed de facto since December 1917. The document which was approved, however, the draft mandate, had itself been the product of difficult negotiations, this time between the British Foreign Office and the Zionist Organization. These negotiations were highly significant, for they determined the ground rules which were to govern the relationship between future British administrations and the Zionists: the mandate outlined the Zionist role in the government, in the allotment of land, and in the economic development of the country. Yet for some reason, this entire issue has been largely overlooked in studies of the mandate. Hopefully, this article will demonstrate that these negotiations have not merited such inattention.` - [Zionist-British Negotiations over the Draft Mandate for Palestine, 1920, John J.
