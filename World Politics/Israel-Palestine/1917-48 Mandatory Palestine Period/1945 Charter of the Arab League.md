- On 22 March 1945, following the [[1944 Alexandria Protocol]]
- A section named `Annex on Palestine` stating that the League of Nations should help the Arab League in achieving independence in Palestine.
    - `At the end of the last Great War, Palestine, together with the other Arab States, was separated from the Ottoman Empire. She became independent, not belonging to any other State.
      
      `The Treaty of Lausanne proclaimed that her fate should be decided by the parties concerned in Palestine.
      
      ` Even though Palestine was not able to control her own destiny, it was on the basis of the recognition of her independence that the Covenant of the League of Nations determined a system of government for her.
      
      `Her existence and her independence among the nations can, therefore, no more be questioned de jure than the independence of any of the other Arab States.
      
      `Even though the outward signs of this independence have remained veiled as a result of force majeure, it is not fitting that this should be an obstacle to the participation of Palestine in the work of the League.
      
      ` Therefore, the States signatory to the Pact of the Arab League consider that in view of Palestine's special circumstances, the Council of the League should designate an Arab delegate from Palestine to participate in its work until this country enjoys actual independence.` - [Charter of the Arab League](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/arableag.asp)
