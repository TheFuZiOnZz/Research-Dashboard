- Aliyah Bet was the code name given to illegal immigration by Jews, most of whom were refugees escaping from Nazi Germany (1933-45), and later Holocaust survivors (1941-45), to Mandatory Palestine between 1920 and 1948, in violation of the restrictions laid out in the [1939 British White Paper](1939%20British%20White%20Paper), which dramatically increased during 1939-48. With the [1948 Israeli Declaration of Independence](../1948-%20Israeli-Palestinian%20Period/1948%20Israeli%20Declaration%20of%20Independence) in May 1948, Jewish displaced persons and refugees from Europe began streaming into the new state in the midst of the [1948-49 War of Independence, First Arab-Israeli War](../1948-%20Israeli-Palestinian%20Period/1948-49%20War%20of%20Independence,%20First%20Arab-Israeli%20War).
