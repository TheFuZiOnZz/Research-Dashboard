- Aliyah Bet was the code name given to illegal immigration by Jews, most of whom were refugees escaping from Nazi Germany (1933-45), and later Holocaust survivors (1941-45), to Mandatory Palestine between 1920 and 1948, in violation of the restrictions laid out in the [[Israel-Palestine Contents Page]], which dramatically increased during 1939-48. With the [[Israel-Palestine Contents Page]] in May 1948, Jewish displaced persons and refugees from Europe began streaming into the new state in the midst of the [[Israel-Palestine Contents Page]].
