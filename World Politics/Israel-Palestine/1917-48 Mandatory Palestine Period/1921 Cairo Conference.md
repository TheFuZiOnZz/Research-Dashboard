- On 12-30 March 1921, The Cairo Conference was a series of meetings by British officials for examining and discussing Middle Eastern problems resolving the conflicting policies defined in the [[1915-16 McMahon-Hussein Correspondence]], the [[1916 Sykes-Picot Agreement]] and the [[1917 Balfour Declaration]], and to frame a common policy. The secret conference of British experts created the blueprint for British control in both Iraq and Transjordan. The Sherifian Solution was offering nominal leadership of those two regions to the sons of the Sharif of the Mecca, Colonial Secretary Winston Churchill felt that the spirit if not the actual letter of Britain's wartime promises to the Arabs were fulfilled.
- The conference was heralded as a success in regards of setting up the UKs policy in the Middle East with Arab leaders leading the new Arab world.
    - `given the accumulated grievances over past and present details of Great Britain's policy, or lack of policy, toward the Arab world, the speech by Churchill was regarded as a triumph for his fresh initiative. He had succeeded in gaining Cabinet endorsement, in placating Parliament, and in marshaling public support for his effort in the Middle East â€” this at a time when Great Britain was straining under the threat of labor strikes and the Irish rebellion and with the London Conference on Turkey having ended in disappointment Yet whatever the reaction at home, the Cairo Conference could succeed or fail only to the extent that its decisions were properly implemented in Iraq, Palestine, and Transjordan.` - [Foundations of British Policy in the Arab World: The Cairo Conference of 1921, Aaron Klieman](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/bafykbzacec7x2rcnzqsydbnnllvr72xvmmr7jbgyb46tq2c3mvq4haanmxbs6?filename=Aaron%20Klieman%20-%20Foundations%20Of%20British%20Policy%20In%20The%20Arab%20World_%20The%20Cairo%20Conference%20Of%201921-Johns%20Hopkins%20University%20Press%20%281970%29.pdf)
