- On 1 February 1944 - 14 May 1948, A successful paramilitary campaign, sometimes referred to as the Palestine Emergency, was carried out by Zionist underground groups against British rule in Mandatory Palestine. This continued with the [[Israel-Palestine Contents Page]].
- The tensions between the Zionist underground and the British mandatory authorities rose from 1938 and intensified with the publication of the [[Israel-Palestine Contents Page]]. The Paper outlined new government policies to place further restrictions on Jewish immigration and land purchases, and declared the intention of giving independence to Palestine, with an Arab majority, within ten years.
- Though World War II brought relative calm, tensions again escalated into an armed struggle towards the end of the war, when it became clear that the Axis powers were close to defeat.
- The Haganah, Irgun, Lehi all joined together to form the Jewish Resistance Movement.
