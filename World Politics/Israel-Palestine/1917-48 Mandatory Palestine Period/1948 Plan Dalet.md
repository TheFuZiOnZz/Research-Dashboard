- On 4 April - 14 May 1948, Plan Dalet or Plan D was
- On 10 March 1948, the plan was formulated and dispatched to the Haganah and originally scheduled to begin mid-May 1948 but was implemented earlier on 4 April 1948.
    - `Plan D, formulated in early March and signed and dispatched to the Haganah brigade commanders on 10 March, was Yadin’s blueprint for concerted operations on the eve of the final British departure and the pan-Arab invasion that was expected to follow hard on its heels. It was scheduled to be implemented in the first half of May, as the British convoys were due to converge on Haifa and Rafah on their way out and as the Arab states’ armies deployed for invasion along the frontiers. The Haganah brigades were expected to move more or less simultaneously in the various sectors.`
      
      `But a variety of factors, chief of which were the debacle on the roads, the specific threat to West Jerusalem and the American retreat from partition, persuaded Ben-Gurion and the HGS to launch this series of campaigns—which, in retrospect, can be seen as the implementation of Plan D—prematurely and in piecemeal fashion. Operation Nahshon was the first step.` - [1948: A History of the First Arab-Israeli War, Benny Morris](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/bafykbzaceboh6eehlb6m6qeyfzcadyiri4vhj3syboxaidhido32jriuuaj3c?filename=Benny%20Morris%20-%201948_%20A%20History%20of%20the%20First%20Arab-Israeli%20War-Yale%20University%20Press%20%282008%29.pdf)
	- `In retrospect, Operation Nahshon marked the start of the implementation of Plan D. The operational order for Nahshon, issued by Avidan on 4 April, defined the objectives as (1) “to push [a] convoy” from Kibbutz Hulda to Jerusalem and (2) “to open the road to Jerusalem by means of offensive operations against enemy bases” along the road to assure the passage of future convoys. The order’s preamble noted that “all of ‘shem’s’ [that is, the Arab] villages along this route are to be regarded as enemy assembly points or bases of operation.”`  - [1948: A History of the First Arab-Israeli War, Benny Morris](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/bafykbzaceboh6eehlb6m6qeyfzcadyiri4vhj3syboxaidhido32jriuuaj3c?filename=Benny%20Morris%20-%201948_%20A%20History%20of%20the%20First%20Arab-Israeli%20War-Yale%20University%20Press%20%282008%29.pdf)
