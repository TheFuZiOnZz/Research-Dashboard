- On
- Called for the establishment of a Jewish National Home in an independent Palestinian state within 10 years.
- Limited Jewish immigration to 75,000 for five years, and allowed Arab majority to determine future Jewish immigration.
- Jews were restricted from buying Arab land in all but 5% of the Mandate.
- The Palestinian Arab parties, acting under Haj Amin Effendi al-Husseini, rejected this proposal, butÂ probably should have accepted.
- The Arab counter offer wanted independence, no Jewish national home in Palestine, replacement of the Mandate by a treaty, and the end of Jewish immigration.
