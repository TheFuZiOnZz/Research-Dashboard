- On 9 November 1918, The Anglo-French Declaration was published by Great Britain and France, shortly after the [[1918 Armistice of Mudros]] saw the capitulation of the Ottoman Empire.
    - `The object aimed at by France and Great Britain in prosecuting in the East the War let loose by the ambition of Germany is the complete and definite emancipation of the peoples so long oppressed by the Turks and the establishment of national governments and administrations deriving their authority from the initiative and free choice of the indigenous populations.
      
      `In order to carry out these intentions France and Great Britain are at one in encouraging and assisting the establishment of indigenous Governments and administrations in Syria and, Mesopotamia, now liberated by the Allies, and in the territories the liberation of which they are engaged in securing and recognising these as soon as they are actually established.
      
      `Far from wishing to impose on the populations of these regions any particular institutions they are only concerned to ensure by their support and by adequate assistance the regular working of Governments and administrations freely chosen by the populations themselves. To secure impartial and equal justice for all, to facilitate the economic development of the country by inspiring and encouraging local initiative, to favour the. diffusion of education, to put an end to dissensions that have too long been taken advantage of by Turkish policy, such is the policy which the two Allied Governments uphold in the liberated territories.` - [Anglo-French Declaration](https://web.archive.org/web/20171201031431/https://unispal.un.org/DPA/DPR/unispal.nsf/0/4C4F7515DC39195185256CF7006F878C)
