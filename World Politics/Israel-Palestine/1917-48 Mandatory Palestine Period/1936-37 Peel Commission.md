- On 7 August 1936, The Peel Commission, formally known as the Palestine Royal Commission, was a British Royal Commission of Inquiry, headed by Lord Peel to investigate the causes of conflict in Mandatory Palestine, following a six-month-long Arab general strike.
- On 7 July 1937, the commission published a report that, for the first time, stated that the Mandate had become unworkable and recommended partition. The British cabinet endorsed the Partition plan in principle, but requested more information spearheading the 1938 Woodhead Commission.
