The defining characteristics of this society, to which we will assign the designation ‘state-capitalism’, are the hyper-concentration of capital and collective exercise of de facto control over the means of production by a state bourgeoisie.” Santos, Emanuel (2018) "Sugarcane Stalinism: State-Capitalism and Development in Cuba," Class, Race and Corporate Power: Vol. 6 : Iss. 2, Article 2.
