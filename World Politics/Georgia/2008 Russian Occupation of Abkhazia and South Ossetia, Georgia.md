- In 8–12 August 2008, Russia backed the self-proclaimed republics of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and aided in the establishment militarily of these two breakaway states away from Georgia.
- This was in response to George W. Bush campaigned for offering a Membership Action Plan (MAP) to Georgia and Ukraine During a NATO summit in Bucharest in April 2008.
	- `President Bush threw the NATO summit meeting here off-script on Wednesday by lobbying hard to extend membership to Ukraine and Georgia, but he failed to rally support for the move among key allies.`
	  
	  `Mr. Bush’s position — that Ukraine and Georgia should be welcomed into a Membership Action Plan, or MAP, that prepares nations for NATO membership — directly contradicted German and French government positions stated earlier this week. It also risked upsetting efforts to get Russia to soften its opposition to positioning a missile defense array in Eastern Europe.`
	  
	  `Mr. Bush failed to win over a consensus of NATO members in a debate at a dinner of NATO leaders, a senior German official said Wednesday night, with at least seven countries lined up against him.`
	  
	  `A senior American official, briefing reporters, said that no final decisions had been made at the dinner, and that all parties agreed on the importance of keeping the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s door open to Ukraine and Georgia.` - [NATO Allies Oppose Bush on Georgia and Ukraine, The New York Times, 2008](https://web.archive.org/web/20190305061544/https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/03/world/europe/03nato.html?pagewanted=all)
- Vladimir Putin was in Bucharest during the summit. At the conclusion of the summit on 4 April, Putin said that NATO's enlargement towards Russia would be look at negatively towards Russia.
    - `President Putin, in a bravura performance before the world’s media at the end of the Nato summit, warned President Bush and other alliance leaders that their plan to expand eastwards to Ukraine and Georgia “didn’t contribute to trust and predictability in our relations”.`
	  
	  `The Russian President, who hands over to Dmitri Medvedev on May 7, said that the world’s problems could not be solved without Russia and he appealed for the West to give due consideration to his country’s security concerns. “So let’s be friends, guys, let’s be frank and open,” he said through an interpreter.`
	  
	  `Expansion of the alliance to Russia’s borders “would be taken in Russia as a direct threat to the security of our country”. Nato statements that this was not directed against Russia were not enough, he said.` - [Vladimir Putin tells summit he wants security and friendship, TimesOnline, 2008](https://web.archive.org/web/20080724150537/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article3681609.ece)
- Following the Bucharest summit, Russian hostility increased and Russia started to actively prepare for the invasion of Georgia.
    - `In hindsight, it was after the Bucharest summit that the preparations for a military confrontation began in earnest. President Mikheil Saakashvili had already warned that this would happen. “If we don’t get [the MAP],” he said, “that’s exactly when they [the Russians] are going to start all kinds of troubles.” He was proved to be right. The NATO summit affirmed that Georgia and Ukraine would, one day, “become members of NATO. ”“But because the summit did not provide for a mechanism to achieve this purpose, explicitly rejecting the Membership Action Plans that would fulfill this function, ” wrote David J. Smith, “Putin read NATO’s fudge for what it was. In other words, the West will continue its dalliance without seriousness of purpose.” “NATO’s failure to approve a Georgian MAP at the April 2008 summit,”wrote Vladimir Socor, “emboldened Russia to escalate military operations against Georgia.” The lifting of the sanctions against the breakaway regions was followed by a decree by President Putin in April 2008 instructing the Russian government to cooperate with the de facto authorities in Abkhazia and South Ossetia and to recognize some documents issued by them. It was the first official step made by Russia to recognize the two breakaway entities. The new relationship, established by Russia with these provinces after April 2008, “was virtually identical to that which existed between Moscow and the federal territories within Russian proper. Georgia noted that Putin’s order amounted to Russia’s full annexation ofthetwo Georgian regions.”31 An imminent annexation was also revealed by the presence of high-ranking Russian FSB officers in the South Ossetian “government.”` - Putin’s Wars: The Rise of Russia’s New Imperialism, Marcel H. Van Herpen, 2014
- Russia’s interest was expressed as protecting Russian citizens.
    - `At the outset of the Russian intervention in South Ossetia, Russian officials claimed that this dramatic step was essential not only to protect Russian citizens (as a result of Russia’s “passportization” policy, more than 90 percent of South Ossetia residents were Russian citizens) in the enclave but also to halt an ongoing genocide of South Ossetians by Georgian forces. Initially, Russian officials asserted that some 2,000 South Ossetian civilians had been killed by the Georgians. But the official tally of South Ossetian civilian deaths in the war was reduced to 162 within a few months.` - [Russia's Military Interventions: Patterns, Drivers, and Signposts, RAND, 2021](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RRA400/RRA444-3/RAND_RRA444-3.pdf)
- Georgia suffered the greatest losses from the war, even being subject to Ethnic Cleansing by South Ossetians authorities.
    - `According to Thbilisi’s official data, Georgia lost 170 troops, 14 policemen and 228 civilians in the August war. 1,964 uniformed personnel were wounded and 14 troops were missing in action` - [THE RUSSIAN-GEORGIAN WAR OF 2008: CAUSES AND IMPLICATION

    - `There were much larger losses among civilians. Following the command of their leader Eduard Kokoity, South Ossetian authorities destroyed almost all Georgian villages in their territory during the campaign of ethnic cleansing. Over 100,000 civilians were forced to flee South Ossetia and Abkhazia. About 35,000 were left with nowhere to return to, as their homes were destroyed.`[link](https://www.ksk.edu.ee/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ENDC_Occasional_Papers_4_final.pdf)

- Putin said in 2008 after the Russo-Georgian war.
    - `Crimea is not a disputed territory. There has been no ethnic conflict there, unlike the conflict between South Ossetia and Georgia. Russia has long recognized the borders of modern-day Ukraine. On the whole, we have completed our talks on borders.` - [link](https://www.businessinsider.com/putin-in-2008-crimea-is-not-disputed-territory-and-is-part-of-ukraine-2015-4?r=US&IR=T)
