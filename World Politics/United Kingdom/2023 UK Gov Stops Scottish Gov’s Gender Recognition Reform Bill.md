### 2023 UK Gov Stops Scottish Gov’s Gender Recognition Reform Bill
- On 17 January 2023, The UK government decided to block the Scottish Gender Recognition Reform bill designed to make it easier for people to change their legal gender. This is also the first time the UK Government has blocked a Scottish Parliament Bill from receiving Royal Ascent.
    
    > `Mr Speaker, today I will make an order under section 35 of the Scotland Act 1998 preventing the Gender Recognition Reform (Scotland) Bill from proceeding to Royal Assent. This Order will mean the Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament will not submit the Bill for Royal Assent. This Government believes however that transgender people deserve our respect, our support and our understanding. My decision is centred on the legislation’s consequences for the operation of reserved matters, including equality legislation across Scotland, England and Wales.` [link](https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/statement-gender-recognition-reform-scotland-bill)
