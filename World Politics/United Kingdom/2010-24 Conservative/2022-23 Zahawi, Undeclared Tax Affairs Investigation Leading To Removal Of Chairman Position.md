### 2022-23 Zahawi, Undeclared Tax Affairs Investigation Leading To Removal Of Chairman Position
- On 5 July 2022, Nadhim Zahawi becomes Chancellor of the Exchequer under Boris Johnson. [link](https://news.sky.com/story/nadhim-zahawi-made-chancellor-after-rishi-sunak-resigns-as-steve-barclay-replaces-sajid-javid-as-health-secretary-12646552)
- On 6 July 2022, The Independent reports that Zahawi had been the subject of an investigation by the NCA, the SFO and HMRC.
    
    > `New chancellor Nadhim Zahawi’s finances were secretly investigated by the National Crime Agency (NCA), The Independent can disclose. A senior serving Whitehall figure has revealed that a number of individuals were formally approached by officials from the NCA about the matter in 2020. The NCA said they were seeking information about multimillionaire Mr Zahawi’s finances, stated the source. The inquiry was codenamed “Operation Catalufa” and is understood to have involved the agency’s International Corruption Unit.` [[chancellornadh]]
    
- On 6 July 2022, The Guardian reports that the Cabinet Office had raised a “red flag” about Zahawi’s tax affairs before his appointment as Chancellor.
    
    > `A “flag” was raised by officials over the financial affairs of the new chancellor, Nadhim Zahawi, before he was promoted, the Observer can reveal. Civil servants in the Cabinet Office’s propriety and ethics team are said to have alerted Boris Johnson to a HM Revenue and Customs “flag” over Zahawi before his appointment. The PM appointed him despite the possible concerns over his tax affairs. “It’s extraordinary that flags were raised ahead of Nadhim’s appointment by the Downing Street proprietary team,” one source said this weekend. “These sorts of concerns would stop someone receiving an MBE or OBE. The idea he could be chancellor or even prime minister is unbelievable”. The revelation comes after a report last week in the Independent that Zahawi was investigated by the National Crime Agency (NCA). The investigation did not lead to any action and there is no suggestion of wrongdoing.` [link](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/09/revealed-officials-raised-flag-over-nadim-zahawis-tax-affairs-before-he-was-appointed-chancellor)
    
- On 10 July 2022, Dan Neidle, Founder of Tax Policy Associates published the estimated calculated tax Zahawi avoided, mostly a gain on YouGov shares which would have been subject to Capital Gains Tax had Zahawi held them, but is tax free in Gibraltar.
    
    > `If Zahawi had held the shares directly, he would have paid about £3.7m of capital gains tax when they were sold in 2017. The trust likely paid no tax. So – unless there is an innocent explanation I am missing – £3.7m of tax was avoided.  
    >   
    > The trust may also avoid UK inheritance tax on assets that ultimately will go to Zahawi’s children. If its assets were just the £24m, that would be almost £10m of inheritance tax avoided. Are there other assets in there? Are the trust assets fully subject to inheritance tax? Again, only Zahawi can clarify this.`

- On 11 July 2022, Zahawi claims he was unaware of the allegations regarding his taxes and said he was being smeared.
    
    > `Nadhim Zahawi has said he is "clearly being smeared" after questions were reportedly raised about his personal finances before his appointment as chancellor. The former education secretary and vaccines minister, who is vying to take over from Boris Johnson, told Sky News he had "always" paid his taxes and had "declared" them in the UK. Should he become prime minister he will publish his accounts annually, he pledged.` [link](https://news.sky.com/story/conservative-leadership-hopeful-nadhim-zahawi-says-he-is-clearly-being-smeared-over-tax-allegations-12649436)
    
    > `Speaking to Sky News presenter Kay Burley, Mr Zahawi said he had been unaware of the allegations. "So I was clearly being smeared. I was being told that the Serious Fraud Office, that the National Crime Agency, that HMRC are looking into me," he said. "I was not aware of this, I have always paid my taxes, I have declared my taxes in the UK." Referring to a possible investigation, Mr Zahawi added: "I will answer any questions that HMRC has of me. "But I will go further: I am going to make a commitment today that if I am prime minister I am going to publish my accounts annually."` [link](https://news.sky.com/story/conservative-leadership-hopeful-nadhim-zahawi-says-he-is-clearly-being-smeared-over-tax-allegations-12649436)
    
- On 13 July 2022, Dan Neidle, Founder of Tax Policy Associates published the reasons as to why Zahawi’s claims don’t line up with the publicly available findings and challenges Zahawi to correct him if he’s gotten it wrong.
    
    > `Zahawi is saying that Balshore got a 45% stake in YouGov because it provided capital to YouGov. There is zero evidence of any capital from Balshore (except, just about possibly, a £91k loan – but that wouldn’t justify a 45% stake). I see only three possibilities:  
    >   
    > 1. I am missing something. What?  
    > 2. Balshore did provide capital, but this was omitted from all of YouGov’s accounts and filings, and not even picked up during the IPO (when financial statements are carefully checked).  
    > 3. Zahawi is lying, and this was tax avoidance.  
    >   
    > I don’t accuse someone of lying frivolously. But Zahawi is making a definitive claim and, right now, there is just no evidence for it. If the answer is indeed that I’ve made a mistake, or the YouGov and Balshore filings are all mistakes, Zahawi should prove it by pointing us towards some actual evidence. Not just making assertions in background briefings to journalists.`

- On 16 July 2022, The Times reported that YouGov themselves denied Zahawi's story, confirming Dan Neidle’s claims.
    
    > `Nadhim Zahawi has been accused of giving a misleading explanation of his tax affairs amid allegations that he may have avoided millions in tax by using an offshore family trust. Before moving into politics, the chancellor made his name in business as one of two co-founders of YouGov, the polling company set up in 2000.` [link](https://archive.ph/AZULP)
    
    > `He said Zahawi’s father had provided £7,000 in start-up capital to YouGov as well as financial support to his son, who had given up his job for the business.  
    >   
    > This explanation now appears to have been undermined YouGov’s company secretary, Tilly Heald, who said that Hareth Zahawi had not advised the business and was merely a shareholder. “To YouGov’s knowledge, YouGov had/has no association with Hareth Zahawi beyond any interests he may have held/holds in Balshore Investments Ltd in its capacity as a YouGov shareholder,” Heald said.  
    >   
    > Employees who worked at YouGov in its early years had no recollection of Zahawi’s father being in the office and were surprised to hear of his alleged involvement with the business.  
    >   
    > According to experts, Zahawi may have avoided tax if he deliberately manoeuvred shares into his father’s offshore company with the intention that he or his family would subsequently benefit through gifts and loans.`

    > Alex Sobel: `This month, the right hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Nadhim Zahawi) was forced to pay millions to His Majesty’s Revenue and Customs to settle a tax dispute. Was the Prime Minister aware of the investigation when he appointed the right hon. Gentleman to his Cabinet and as chairman of the Conservative party? Will the Prime Minister demand accountability from his Cabinet members over their tax affairs?`  
    >   
    > Rishi Sunak: `My right hon. Friend has already addressed the matter in full and there is nothing more that I can add.`

- On 21 January 2023, Zahawi said his tax error was found to be `careless and not deliberate`
    
    > `Nadhim Zahawi says his tax error was found to be "careless and not deliberate" after Labour called for him to be sacked over his finances. The Tory chairman and cabinet member released a statement saying he wanted to "address some of the confusion" about his finances. He said his father took founder shares in YouGov and that HMRC later "disagreed about the exact allocation", leading him to "settle the matter and pay what they said was due". "They concluded that this was a 'careless and not deliberate' error," he said. "So that I could focus on my life as a public servant, I chose to settle the matter and pay what they said was due, which was the right thing to do." 'I asked my father to help'` [link](https://news.sky.com/story/nadhim-zahawi-says-tax-error-was-careless-and-not-deliberate-12791829)
    
- On 23 January 2023, Sunak orders investigation into Nadhim Zahawi tax affairs by his independent ethics adviser.
    
    > `Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has asked his independent ethics adviser to look into the disclosures made about the tax affairs of Nadhim Zahawi. Mr Sunak said there were "questions that need answering" over the case. Tory party chairman Mr Zahawi is facing calls to resign, after it emerged he paid a penalty to HMRC over previously unpaid tax while he was chancellor, as part of a multi-million pound dispute. He said he was "confident" he had "acted properly throughout". On a visit to a hospital in Northamptonshire, Mr Sunak told reporters: "Integrity and accountability is really important to me and clearly in this case there are questions that need answering.` [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-64373509)
    
- On 26 January 2023, the chief executive of HMRC confirmed that no tax penalty is given for misfiling your taxes accidentally.
    
    > `Mr Harra, the chief executive of HMRC, gave evidence to the Commons Public Accounts Committee about managing tax compliance following the pandemic. The MPs also quizzed him about Mr Zahawi's tax arrangements. He said he would not comment on specific individuals, but added: "There are no penalties for innocent errors in your tax affairs. So if you take reasonable care, but nevertheless make a mistake, whilst you will be liable for the tax and for interest if it's paid late, you would not be liable for a penalty. "But if your error was as a result of carelessness, then legislation says that a penalty could apply in those circumstances."` [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-64410490)
    
- On 29 January 2023, Sir Laurie Magnus, Independent Ethics Adviser, in a letter to Rishi Sunak found that the Zahawi’s settlement amounted to a breach of the ministerial code.
    
    > `I consider that Mr Zahawi, in holding the high privilege of being a Minister of the Crown, has shown insufficient regard for the general principles of the Ministerial Code and the requirements in particular, under the Seven Principles of Public Life, to be honest, open and an exemplary leader through his own behaviour.  
    >   
    > I want to commend Mr Zahawi for his willingness to assist with my inquiry. I also fully appreciate the pressures faced by ministers as they address the complex issues of government and the difficulties they encounter in balancing the demands of their personal lives and their ministerial responsibilities.  
    >   
    > These factors, however, cannot mitigate my overall judgement that Mr Zahawi's conduct as a minister has fallen below the high standards that, as Prime Minister, you rightly expect from those who serve in your government.`  
    > [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-64444315)
    
- On 29 January 2023, Rishi Sunak the sent a letter to Nadhim Zahawi sacking him as Chairman of the Conservative Party.
    
    > `When I became Prime Minister last year, I pledged that the Government I lead would have integrity, professionalism and accountability at every level.  
    >   
    > That is why, following new information which came to light in recent days regarding your personal financial arrangements and declarations, I asked Sir Laurie Magnus, the Independent Adviser on Ministers' Interests, to fully investigate this matter. You agreed and undertook to co-operate fully with the inquiry.  
    >   
    > Following the completion of the Independent Adviser's investigation - the findings of which he has shared with us both - it is clear that there has been a serious breach of the Ministerial Code. As a result, I have informed you of my decision to remove you from your position in His Majesty's Government.`  
    > [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-64444315)
    
- On 29 January 2023, Nadhim Zahawi then replied to Rishi Sunak.
    
    > `Thank you for your kind words. It has been, after being blessed with my loving family, the privilege of my life to serve in successive governments and make what I believe to have been a tangible difference to the country I love.  
    >   
    > ...  
    >   
    > I am concerned, however, about the conduct of some of the fourth estate in recent weeks. In a week when a Member of Parliament was physically assaulted, I fail to see how one headline on this issue 'The Noose Tightens' reflects legitimate scrutiny of public officials. I am sorry to my family for the toll this has taken on them.  
    >   
    > You can be assured of my support form the backbenches in the coming years. Your five priorities are the right priorities, and I will do whatever I can to help you deliver them.`
