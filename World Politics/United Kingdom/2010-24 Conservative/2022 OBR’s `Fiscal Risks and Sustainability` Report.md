### 2022 OBR’s `Fiscal Risks and Sustainability` Report
- On July 2022, the Office for Budget Responsibility released a `Fiscal risks and sustainability` report, [link](https://obr.uk//docs/dlm_uploads/Fiscal_risks_and_sustainability_2022-1.pdf) which included:
    
    > `The pandemic has had remarkably little impact on the medium-term fiscal position (with debt marginally higher but the primary balance slightly stronger), thanks in part to the substantial tax rises announced in its wake. Since our 2018 FSR, demographic pressures have eased somewhat in the nearterm thanks to a lower birth rate and slower improvements in life expectancy, reducing age-related spending as a share of GDP, while lower migration levels bring some fiscal offsets. But in the long run the pressures of an aging population on spending and the loss of existing motoring taxes in a decarbonising economy leaves public debt on an unsustainable path in the long term.`
    
    > `These emergent geopolitical and energy risks, and all of those analysed in our previous FRRs, need to be managed in the context of a set of longer-term demographic, environmental, and other structural pressures on the public finances. These are the largest, and most certain, threats to long-term fiscal sustainability – with every assessment we have published over the past decade having shown debt on an unsustainable path over the next 50 years as a result of these pressures. We have made only modest changes to the main demographic and economic assumptions underpinning our latest long-term projections, but some have significant fiscal implications`
    
    > `The continuously rising primary deficit means that net debt increases from 84 per cent of GDP in 2026-27 to 100 per cent in 2052-53 and then rises rapidly to 267 per cent of GDP by 2071-72. Despite this unsustainable path, this is 20 per cent of GDP lower than in our 2018 FSR projections. This partly reflects the improved starting primary deficit, as well as the more favourable interest rates relative to economic growth (‘R-G’) at the end of our latest medium-term horizon. Despite increasing the primary deficit by 2071-72, the cumulative effect of revised demographics across the projection period is to reduce debt as the more favourable near-term position outweighs the less favourable one in the longer term. These sources of downward revision are largely offset by the removal of net zero affected taxes.`
    
    > `These projections are not intended to provide a forecast of the actual evolution of revenue or spending. Rather they show what would happen if policy were unchanged and if our other conditioning assumptions also held true – most importantly that spending pressures are accommodated. If the projections suggest that the public finances are on an unsustainable path, and that were indeed to prove to be the case in practice, then one might expect a future government  
    > to take corrective action at some point.`  
    
    > `The combination of the primary balance and financial transactions projections set out above would leave public sector net debt and net interest spending on an unsustainable upward path over the long term (Table 4.11 and Chart 4.13 below). Up to the 2040s, net debt declines slowly reflecting relatively small primary deficits and relatively favourable growth corrected interest rates (that result in low net interest spending).`
    
    > `In all cases the fiscal gap is negative, consistent with the unsustainable fiscal position over the long run. To get the debt-to-GDP ratio to 75 per cent in 2071-72 would require a permanent increase in taxes and/or cut in spending of 4.2 per cent of GDP (£104 billion in today’s terms) in 2027-28. Since it is very unlikely that a government would try to offset several decades’ worth of future demographic and other cost pressures via a single upfront adjustment, a more realistic alternative adjustment is illustrated via the ‘gradual progress’ variant, which would require a series of tax increases or spending cuts worth an additional 1.5 per cent of GDP (£37 billion in today’s terms) each decade. This tightening is additional to any other tightening already announced, such as the health and social care levy, and in addition to announcements that are expected to affect the public finances over a longer time horizon and that are included in our central projection, such as linking changes to the State Pension age to life expectancy.`
