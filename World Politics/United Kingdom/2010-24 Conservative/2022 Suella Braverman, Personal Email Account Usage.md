### 2022 Suella Braverman, Personal Email Account Usage
- On 19 October 2022, Braverman resigned as Home Secretary for a self-described mistake that led to a breach in the ministerial code.
    
    - Braverman Letter: `It is with the greatest regret that I am choosing to tender my resignation.  
    -   
    - Earlier today, I sent an official document from my personal email to a trusted parliamentary colleague as part of policy engagement, and with the aim of garnering support for government policy on migration. This constitutes a technical infringement of the rules. As you know, the document "as a draft Written Ministerial Statement about migration. due for publication imminently. Much of it had already been briefed to MPs. Nevertheless it is right for me to go.  
    -   
    - As soon as I realised my mistake, I rapidly reported this on official channels. and informed the Cabinet Secretary. As Home Secretary I hold myself to the highest standards and my resignation is the right thing to do. The business of government relies upon people accepting responsibility for their mistakes. Pretending we haven't made mistakes, carrying on as if everyone can't see that we have made them. and hoping that things will magically come right is not serious politics. I have made a mistake: I accept responsibility: I resign.`

- On 22 October 2022, The Times reported that the story given by Braverman was inaccurate and the incident was more common than she stated.
    
    - `The wheels began to fall off when Simon Case, the cabinet secretary, alerted Truss that Suella Braverman, the home secretary, had committed two breaches of the ministerial code. She had emailed cabinet papers from her ministerial account to her private gmail account and then on to backbench veteran Sir John Hayes, a fellow right-winger. She also copied in someone she thought was Hayes’s wife but was actually an assistant to Andrew Percy, the MP for Brigg and Goole. After taking advice from colleagues, Percy spoke to the chief whip, Wendy Morton, who referred the issue to Case.  
    -   
    - Braverman was later to argue that the document was simply a written ministerial statement, that she had had a blazing row with Truss about immigration numbers (implying that was the real reason for her dismissal) and that she had sent it by mistake at 4am. It was, in fact, sent three or four hours later that morning.`

    - “It was sent from a private email address to another member of parliament,” he told TalkTV’s Kate McCann. “She then sought to copy in that individual’s wife and accidentally sent it to a staffer in parliament. To me, that seems a really serious breach, especially when it was documents relating to cyber security, as I believe. That seems a really serious breach.  
    -   
    - “The cabinet secretary had his say at the time, I doubt he changed his mind in the last six days but that is a matter for the new prime minister.”`

- On 31 October 2022, Braverman sent a letter the the Chair of the Home Affair Select Committee explaining the issues surrounding the resignation where Braverman mentioned that she had used her email accounts like this at least six times.
    
    - `Following my referral and subsequent resignation, the Home Office conducted a review of my use of personal email and verified the above sequence of events. The review also identified that within the period between 6th September and 19th October, I had sent official documents from my Government email to my personal email address on six occasions (see Appendix). The review confirmed that all of these occasions occurred in circumstances when I was conducting Home Office meetings virtually or related to public lines to take in interviews. Some of these meetings had been hastily arranged in response to urgent operational matters relating to Home Office priorities. The review also confirmed that on no other occasions had my Special Adviser emailed my personal account in relation to official business.

    - I have been transparent about my mistakes relating to the Ministerial Code. As referenced above, at the heart of the Code lies the principle of responsibility on Ministers, ‘for deciding how to act and conduct themselves in light of the Code and for justifying their actions and conduct to Parliament and the public’ (paragraph 1.6). Of course, the Prime Minister is the ultimate judge of standards and the appropriate consequences of a breach of the standards. There is a range of sanctions including a public apology or remedial action.  
    -   
    - Although the level of risk here was low, the document did not relate to national security or law enforcement matters and the breach was swiftly and proactively reported to officials, I nevertheless decided to take full responsibility by tendering my resignation.  
    -   
    - I am sorry for the errors of judgement set out above and I reiterated my apology to Mr Percy MP yesterday. I hold myself as Home Secretary to the highest possible standards and I am glad to be able to serve again. I am grateful to the Prime Minister for his ongoing confidence following my reappointment.`
