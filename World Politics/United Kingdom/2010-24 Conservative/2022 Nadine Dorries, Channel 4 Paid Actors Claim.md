### 2022 Nadine Dorries, Channel 4 Paid Actors Claim
- On 19 May 2022, Nadine Dorries, the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport appeared in front of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee in which she claimed that Channel 4 faked a reality TV show she appeared on in 2010 by hiring actors to play poverty-stricken people on a housing estate.
    
    - `Dr Huq: I might avail myself as well. I remember asking in the Chamber about the same issue and I do not think it is sorted. One of my favourite Channel 4 programmes was "Tower Block of Commons"; I think we have chatted about it before. You were on it as a young MP on the South Acton estate, being sent to see how the other half live.  
    -   
    - Ms Dorries: Then I later discovered that they were actually actors.  
    -   
    - Chair: What, the MPs or the—  
    -   
    - Ms Dorries: No, the people in the estate. It was a Channel 4 production. The parents of some of the boys in that programme contacted me and came here to have lunch to tell me that the boys were in acting school. They were not really living in a flat—they were not real. They were actually actors.  
    -   
    - Dr Huq: That will be a headline tomorrow.  
    -   
    - Ms Dorries: If you remember, there was a pharmacist I went to see who prepared food; she was also a paid actor as well.  
    -   
    - Dr Huq: It was jolly good viewing, and it was on the South Acton estate.`

- On 15 July 2022, Channel 4 released a statement in response to the comments Dorries made.
    
    - `At the DCMS Committee meeting on 19 May 2022, Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, Nadine Dorries MP alleged that contributors to the 2010 Channel 4 series Tower Block of Commons, in which she appeared, were paid actors, in acting school and/or not living in the homes in which they were portrayed in the series as living.  
    -   
    - Channel 4 takes any allegations of misrepresentation extremely seriously and always rigorously investigates any such claims.  
    -   
    - In keeping with standard practice Channel 4 asked Love Productions, who produced the programme, to conduct a thorough investigation into the concerns raised. The investigation, overseen by their external lawyers, encompassed contributors who were ordinary members of the public and with whom The Secretary of State had significant interaction. It involved speaking with many of those involved in the making of the series, including contributors and crew, and retrieving and reviewing relevant documentation and footage, including 85 hours of raw footage filmed for the series.  
    -   
    - Channel 4 then reviewed Love Productions’ findings and undertook its own internal document searches and review.  
    -   
    - Neither Love Productions' investigation nor Channel 4’s internal inquiries revealed any evidence to support the allegations made about the programme.`

- On 20 October 2022, the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee released a report on the comments made by Dorries and found them to not be credible.
    
    - `We are disappointed with Ms Dorries reluctance to engage with the Committee on this matter. Ms Dorries at first refused to reconsider her claims and her subsequent clarifications introduce more confusion than they resolve.  
    -   
    - In the Committee she talks about meeting boys in a flat (which matches Channel 4's investigation) who later turned out to be actors. Her clarification talks about a homeless young men section.  
    -   
    - In the Committee she said that she saw a pharmacist who prepared food and who was also an actor. In her clarification, that pharmacist was the mother of one of the boys.  
    -   
    - In the Committee she said that the parents of one of the boys contacted her and came to have lunch to tell her the boys were in acting school. In her clarification, the mother, who was also the pharmacist, arranged for her son to come to the House for a tour and lunch and it was he who told her about being an actor.  
    -   
    - We do not find either the original claims, or the clarifications to be credible and have seen no corroboration of her claims that Channel 4 and Love Productions used actors in a reality television show. In contrast, the detailed investigation carried out by Channel 4 gives us confidence that her claims are groundless. We are concerned Ms Dorries appears to have taken an opportunity, under the protection of privilege, to traduce the reputation of Channel 4.`
