- On 22 January 2023, Labour began calling for an investigation into a loan and then-appointment to the Chairman of the BBC around Richard Sharp.
    
    > `Labour is calling for a parliamentary investigation into claims the chairman of the BBC helped Boris Johnson secure a loan guarantee, weeks before the then-PM recommended him for the role. The Sunday Times says Richard Sharp was involved in arranging a guarantor on a loan of up to £800,000 for Mr Johnson. Mr Sharp said he had "simply connected" people and there was no conflict of interest. Mr Johnson's spokesman said he did not receive financial advice from Mr Sharp. He also dismissed Labour's suggestion Mr Johnson could have breached the code of conduct for MPs "through failing to appropriately declare the arrangement" on his Parliamentary register of interests.` [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-64362640)
    
- On 23 January 2023, An investigation was announced by the watchdog in which oversees the public appointments process.
    
    > `The process of hiring BBC chairman Richard Sharp is to be reviewed by the watchdog that oversees how public appointments are made. It follows claims that shortly before being given the job, Mr Sharp helped the then-prime minister, Boris Johnson, secure a loan guarantee agreement. William Shawcross, the Commissioner for Public Appointments, said the review would ensure the hiring followed rules. Mr Sharp said he "simply connected" people and did not arrange financing.` [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-64377685)
    
- On 28 January 2023, The Times reported that Johnson was formally told to stop seeking financial advice from Richard Sharp by the Cabinet Secretary, Simon Case.
    
    > `Boris Johnson was formally told to stop asking Richard Sharp for “advice” about his “personal financial matters” days before Sharp was announced as the next BBC chairman, according to a leaked Cabinet Office memo.  
    >   
    > Johnson, then prime minister, was warned by officials on December 22, 2020 that he had to stop speaking to Sharp about his financial affairs. Sharp was announced as the government’s choice for chairman of the national broadcaster on January 6, 2021.  
    >   
    > The Cabinet Office document was drawn up after Johnson and Sharp sought advice in early December on accepting a loan of up to £800,000 guaranteed by the prime minister’s distant cousin, Sam Blyth, a Canadian businessman. Blyth and Sharp had discussed how to help Johnson with his finances on two occasions, the first, at a dinner in September and the second, on the telephone. Johnson secured the loan in February 2021, according to his own declaration in the internal register of ministers’ interests, parts of which are not made public.`

- On 6 February 2023, The Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments announce they would investigate the appointment process.
    
    > `The Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments (OCPA) has appointed Adam Heppinstall KC to lead on its consideration of the public appointment process that led to the appointment of the BBC Chair in February 2021. This follows the recusal of William Shawcross.  
    >   
    > This will be carried out under the Public Appointments Order in Council 2019 - to provide assurance on whether the appointment process was conducted in line with the government’s Governance Code for Public Appointments.`

- On 9 February 2023, the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee released a report on the Appointment of Richard Sharp as Chair of the BBC.
    
    > `Mr Sharp recognised the need to be open and transparent over facilitating an introduction of the then Prime Minister to Mr Blyth regarding the £800,000 loan guarantee and brought this to the attention of the Cabinet Secretary. However, he failed to apply the same standards of openness and candour in his decision not to divulge this information during the interview process or to this committee during the pre-appointment hearing.  
    >   
    > The public appointments process can only work effectively if all those involved are open and transparent. Richard Sharp chose to tell the then Prime Minister both of his application to Chair the BBC and of his involvement in the arrangement of a loan for the Mr Johnson but decided not to tell either the appointment panel or this Committee about his actions. The Prime Minister, the panel and this Committee are all integral to the appointment process for the Chair of the BBC, but only Mr Johnson was fully aware of Mr Sharp’s potential conflict at the time the appointment was made. The Government, and all those involved in the public appointments process must ensure that the future public appointments process is not clouded by partial disclosure.`

- On 28 April 2023, The Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments published its report into .
    
    > `DCMS did not keep a formal record of these checks but were satisfied that Ms Baxendale's political donations were made outside of the five-year period mentioned above. It is noted that the press reported that she was shortlisted to be a Conservative candidate, not that she stood as a candidate in a general election.  
    >   
    > Ms Baxendale told this Inquiry that the donation was made in 2011 by her husband (erroneously recorded in her name), that she was last on a shortlist to be a candidate in 2017 and withdrew from that list shortly afterwards. She candidly and transparently drew attention to the fact that she served as Chair of her local Conservative Association from March 2016 to July 2020. She provided evidence that the  
    > Commissioner had approved her to act as a SIPM in a different DCMS appointment process in July 2021 (i.e. he had been satisfied that she was not politically active at that time). It would therefore appear that there was no "significant political activity" which might have caused concern and no reason to doubt that Ms Baxendale (or Ms Cluff) were appropriately appointed to this Panel.  
    >   
    > Whilst the "independent" element of this Panel was substantially provided by the SIPM, it is recommended that Appointing Authorities (see paragraph 5, Annex A), especially in relation to high profile appointments, ought to have a process to allow Ministers to conclude "whether there are relationships or circumstances which are likely to affect, or could appear to affect the Panellist's judgement" as well as checks on "significant political activity" as above. It is unfortunate that formal records of the checks which were performed were not retained. They should be retained in future.  
    >   
    > It is recorded that from the information I have been provided, it appears that DCMS did inform the Commissioner of the composition of the whole Panel and that he raised no concerns. This is not a Governance Code requirement but was good practice in a high profile appointment such as this.  
    >   
    > This Inquiry has not detected anything which would call into question the independence of the senior and non-senior independent Panel members (to the standard required by the Governance Code) who acted, from what I have seen and have been told, appropriately throughout.`

    > `BBC chairman Richard Sharp has resigned after breaking rules over dealings with Boris Johnson ahead of his appointment.  
    >   
    > ...  
    >   
    > The details of who said what to who and when are complicated but there is a simple issue, did Richard Sharp tell the full truth when he applied for the job?  
    >   
    > He says today's independent report makes clear that he didn't and he was in breach of the rules.  
    >   
    > That breach he says was "inadvertent" and an "error" he regrets - but it matters.  
    >   
    > He is the head of the BBC and its reputation is based on trust. The job description for the BBC Chairman says it is essential that they "observe high standards of openness and seek to maximise transparency and accountability".  
    >   
    > MPs on the Commons Media Select Committee have already criticised Richard Sharp for a lack of openness and transparency for not revealing his role in a loan guarantee to Boris Johnson. These were, they said, "serious errors of judgment".`
