    -   
    - ...  
    -   
    - Bond markets were in a spin. A drop in gilts prices pushed the yield on 10-year debt up by some 0.33 percentage points to 3.83 per cent, marking a 0.7 percentage point jump in yields over the course of the week — a massive move by the standards of a market that has historically bumped around by tiny increments.`

- On 25 September 2022, Truss defended the tax cuts as helping ordinary people.
    
    - `Liz Truss has defended the government’s economic changes as “helping ordinary people with their taxes” and “incentivising businesses to invest”.  
    -   
    - The prime minister said that her reforms aimed to attract investment and grow jobs as she rejected an American interviewer’s contrast with President Biden’s recent tweet that he was “sick and tired of trickle-down economics. It has never worked.”`

### Reactions to the Budget
- On 27 September 2022, The International Monetary Fund urged Truss to reverse the top rate tax cut.
    
    - `The International Monetary Fund has urged Liz Truss to reverse the decision to abolish the top rate of income tax, in a highly unusual attack on the economic policy of a G7 country.  
    -   
    - The world’s lender of last resort heaped pressure on Ms Truss and the Chancellor, as it urged Kwasi Kwarteng to use his fiscal plan in November to change course.  
    -   
    - The IMF said it is “closely monitoring recent economic developments in the UK and are engaged with the authorities" and warned that the fiscal stimulus risks undermining the Bank of England’s efforts to curb inflation.`  
    - [link](https://archive.ph/RZeK5)
    
- On 28 September 2022, as a reaction to the economic effects of the budget, The Bank of England said that it would buy as many long-dated government bonds as needed between now and 14 October 2022 to stabilise financial markets, and added that it would postpone next week's start of its gilt sale programme.
    
    - `As the Governor said in his statement on Monday, the Bank is monitoring developments in financial markets very closely in light of the significant repricing of UK and global financial assets.  
    -   
    - This repricing has become more significant in the past day – and it is particularly affecting long-dated UK government debt. Were dysfunction in this market to continue or worsen, there would be a material risk to UK financial stability. This would lead to an unwarranted tightening of financing conditions and a reduction of the flow of credit to the real economy.  
    -   
    - In line with its financial stability objective, the Bank of England stands ready to restore market functioning and reduce any risks from contagion to credit conditions for UK households and businesses.  
    -   
    - To achieve this, the Bank will carry out temporary purchases of long-dated UK government bonds from 28 September. The purpose of these purchases will be to restore orderly market conditions. The purchases will be carried out on whatever scale is necessary to effect this outcome. The operation will be fully indemnified by HM Treasury.`

- On 28 September 2022, It was revealed that the reason for the Bank of England’s intervention was because of a response from the markets which, if continued without such intervention, would of led to the collapse of the British Pension system.
    
    - `The Bank of England's dramatic intervention today was in response to a "run dynamic" emerging in the British pensions system which could have resulted in the collapse of a swathe of institutions within hours, Sky News understands.  
    -   
    - Bank staff worked through the night on Tuesday and into Wednesday morning to prepare the unprecedented package, which will see it buying up a potentially limitless number of targeted government bonds.`  
    - [link](https://news.sky.com/story/run-dynamic-could-have-seen-pensions-collapse-within-hours-12707014)
    
- On 28 September 2022, The Treasury announced that they had no plans to change course with the budget proposals.
    
    - `Treasury minister Andrew Griffith said the government's proposals were the "right plans" to grow the UK economy.  
    -   
    - He claimed "every major economy is dealing with exactly the same issues" and said the impact of "Putin's war in Ukraine is cascading through things like the cost of energy, some of the supply side implications of that".`  
    - [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-63067163)
    
- On 29 September 2022, The Bank of England’s Chief Economist and Executive Director for Monetary Analysis, Huw Pill, in a speech said,
    
    - `These operations do not create central bank money on a lasting basis. As a result they will not shift the underlying macroeconomically-relevant monetary trends in the economy, which ultimately pin down developments in the price level. They are not intended to cap or control longer-term interest rates or to offer more favourable underlying financing conditions to the institutions involved – or, for that matter, to the Government – than would have prevailed in an orderly market environment.  
    -   
    - In the spirit of the famous Bagehot rule addressing the threat of bank deposit runs, yesterday’s intervention is intended to prevent painful, adverse self-fulfilling market dynamics emerging.  
    -   
    - That is why yesterday’s intervention is a “temporary and targeted financial stability operation”. It is intended to allow the inevitable and necessary re-pricing of financial assets stemming from recent macroeconomic news – including last week’s fiscal announcements – to take place in an orderly way.`

- On 2 October 2022, Truss admitted that ground should have been laid for tax cuts and that the Chancellor, Kwarteng, didn't discuss the top level cut with the rest of the cabinet.
    
    - `Liz Truss has admitted she should have "laid the ground better" for her mini-budget, after it sparked days of market turmoil.  
    -   
    - The prime minister told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg she had "learned from that", but she was confident her tax cutting package would boost economic growth.  
    -   
    - She added a decision to cut the top earner tax rate was a "decision that the chancellor made".  
    -   
    - And she revealed it was not discussed with the whole cabinet beforehand.`  
    - [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-63107649)
    
### Lack Of OBR Forecasting
- Before the budgets announcement, Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng refused to let the Office for Budget Responsibility release forecasts on the mini-budget.
    
    - `Kwasi Kwarteng has refused to let a government watchdog assess the economic impact of planned tax cuts expected in a mini-budget on Friday.  
    -   
    - Mel Stride, the Tory chair of the Treasury select committee, urged Kwarteng to allow independent forecasts for the public finances to be published alongside his mini-budget on Friday. Stride released a strongly worded statement urging more clarity around the effects of the new chancellor’s fiscal interventions.`  
    - [link](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/sep/20/kwasi-kwarteng-urged-to-allow-release-of-obr-forecasts-with-mini-budget)
    
- On 30 September 2022, A reply letter between the SNP Leader of the Commons, Ian Blackford and the Chair of the Office of Budget Responsibility revealing that the OBR were not commissioned by the Chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng to produce a forecast on the mini budget but expressed they were prepared to based on the remit of the OBR.
    
    - `As we set out in our letter to the Chair of the Treasury Committee on 26 August, we took steps over the summer to prepare a forecast to coincide with the election of the new Prime Minister and any subsequent fiscal policy announcements. We sent a draft economic and fiscal forecast to the new Chancellor on 6 September, his first day in office. We offered, at the time, to update that forecast to take account of subsequent data and to reflect the economic and fiscal impact of any policies the Government announced in time for it to be published alongside the ‘fiscal event’ planned for later in the month.  
    -   
    - In the event, we were not commissioned to produce an updated forecast alongside the Chancellor’s Growth Plan on 23 September, although we would have been in a position to do so to a standard that satisfied the legal requirements of the Charter for Budget Responsibility enacted by Parliament`  
    - [link](https://obr.uk//docs/dlm_uploads/Sep2022_IBlackfordMP_forecast.pdf)
    
- On 3 October 2022, The Commons Treasury committee announced that it was beginning to investigate the lack of OBR Forecast published after listening to evidence from major UK economic experts which dismissed both the proposed growth numbers touted by Truss and claims of the reaction by the Bank of England to this package being a worldwide problem, not a UK specific problem.
    
    - `Senior economists have dismissed Liz Truss’s chances of reaching 2.5% economic growth in the next few years, as they said her government’s “guerrilla tactics” in last month’s mini-budget played a major role in spooking markets.  
    -   
    - Speaking to the Commons Treasury committee, the economists said the 2.5% growth target was “almost impossible”. The committee has launched its own investigation into the mini-budget in the absence of a formal forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility.  
    -   
    - The economists also dismissed the arguments of Jacob Rees-Mogg, the business secretary, that turmoil in pension funds had been caused by global factors alone, and warned that Kwasi Kwarteng, the chancellor, would need to unveil either spending cuts or tax increases to reassure markets in a promised statement on 31 October.  
    -   
    - Answering questions from the cross-party committee of MPs, Jagjit Chadha, the head of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) thinktank, said confidence had been badly undermined by “what can only be described as guerrilla tactics against our independent economic institutions over the summer: the Treasury, the Bank of England and the OBR”.  
    -   
    - He said: “There was a sense in which there was undermining of the cooperative arrangements that we had between the monetary and financial institutions, that theoretically and in practice have led to lower interest rates and lower deficits than would otherwise have to be the case.`  
    - [link](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/oct/12/mini-budget-will-not-lead-to-promised-growth-leading-economists-tell-mps)
    
- On 23 September 2022, A letter between the SNP Leader of the Commons, Ian Blackford and the Chair of the Office of Budget Responsibility showed the OBR being asked for clarity around the lack of economic forecasting.
    
    - `...given today’s events on the financial markets we particularly believe urgent updates and forecasts are needed on the following.  
    -   
    - • A renewed forecast on mortgage costs for households facing rising interest rates.  
    - • The impact of the plummeting pound on imports, especially food prices ahead of this winter.  
    - • And the immediate and long-term cost of increased bond borrowing on the public finances.  
    -   
    - We believe your office’s independent analysis is essential if we are to fully understand the depth of the damage done by the Chancellor in today’s statement. Families and businesses need to know the consequences of the political choices made by this reckless UK government.  
    -   
    - We look forward to your response`

### Economic Analysis
- On 23 September 2022, The Institute for Fiscal Studies released a response to the budget proposal which said:
    
    - `Paul Johnson, IFS Director, said:  
    -   
    - Today, the Chancellor announced the biggest package of tax cuts in 50 years without even a semblance of an effort to make the public finance numbers add up. Instead, the plan seems to be to borrow large sums at increasingly expensive rates, put government debt on an unsustainable rising path, and hope that we get better growth.  
    -   
    - ...  
    -   
    - The Government’s costing of the Energy Price Guarantee for households and non-domestic consumers - £60 billion over the next six months - means that borrowing this year is now on course to climb to £190 billion. At 7.5% of national income this would make it the third-highest peak in borrowing since the Second World War, after the Global Financial Crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic.  
    -   
    - By 2026-27 we now forecast that borrowing will be over £110 billion - 3.9% of GDP - which is more than £80 billion higher than the £32 billion forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility in March. Over half of this increase in borrowing is due to the almost £45 billion a year of tax cuts announced by the Chancellor today.`  
    - [link](https://ifs.org.uk/articles/mini-budget-response)
    
- On 24 September 2022, The Resolution Foundation released a response to the budget proposal which said:
    
    - `The tax cuts confirmed yesterday are strongly focused on higher-income households, driven by the reversal of the rise in National Insurance and the scrapping of the additional 45p rate of Income Tax, along with associated cuts to Dividend Tax. Next year they will see someone earning £200,000 gain £5,220 a year, with the gain rising to £55,220 for a £1 million earner. Those on £20,000 will gain just £157. The result is that almost half (47 per cent) of the gains will go to the richest 5 per cent of households, compared to 12 per cent for the entire poorer half. Moreover, those living in the South East or London will see over three-times (on average, £1,600) the gains of those in the North East, Wales and Yorkshire (an average of £500). The South is also where the main impact of a welcome cut to Stamp Duty will be felt: the tax bill on the sale of the average first-time buyer home in London will fall by £6,300, compared to no gain for the average first-time buyer in the North East.  
    -   
    - This package of tax cuts largely reverses rises announced by Rishi Sunak in recent years, but does not do so entirely: the four-year freeze to income tax thresholds remains in place. The scale of that freeze in an era of high inflation means that the vast majority of earners will still see their personal taxes increased when all tax changes announced during this Parliament are taken into account. Those earning under £155,000 will see their tax bill increase or be unaffected, with only those earning over £155,000 will receive a net tax cut thanks to the scrapping of the 45p tax rate. Workers earning between £63,000 and £125,000 lose the most (almost £1,500 in 2025-26). A similar pattern can be seen among households, even considering increases to benefit generosity as well: only the top 5 per cent will see significant income gains from policy changes (averaging £2,520 by 2025-26). Despite the rhetoric, tax as a share of the economy remains at its highest sustained level since the 1940s (at around 35 per cent of GDP).`

### 1st U-Turn
- On 3 October 2022, Truss and Kwarteng axed the idea to remove the top rate of income tax.
    
    - `Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng has confirmed that the government is axing plans to give the wealthiest 1% a tax cut following a bitter backlash from Tory MPs.  
    -   
    - Mr Kwarteng said in a tweet that the measure had become a "distraction" from his objective to grow the economy.  
    -   
    - He said: "We get it, we have listened."`

### 2nd U-Turn & Kwarteng Sacking
- On 14 October 2022, after further economic turmoil, It was announced that Truss had replaced Kwarteng as Chancellor of the Exchequer with Jeremy Hunt along with replacing Chris Philip as Chief Secetary to the Treasury with Edward Argar.
    
    - Kwarteng Resignation Letter: `You have asked me to stand aside as your Chancellor. I have accepted.  
    -   
    - When you asked me to serve as your Chancellor, I did so in full knowledge that the situation we faced was incredibly difficult. with rising global interest rates and energy prices. However. your vision of optimism, growth and change was right.  
    -   
    - As I have said many times in the past weeks. following the status quo was simply not an option. For too long this country has been dogged by low growth rates and high taxation — that must still change if this country is to succeed.  
    -   
    - The economic environment has changed rapidly since we set out the Growth Plan on 23 September. In response, together with the Bank of England and excellent officials at the Treasury we have responded to those events, and I commend my officials for their dedication. It is important now as we move forward to emphasise your government's commitment to fiscal discipline. The Medium-Term Fiscal Plan is crucial to this end, and 1 look formed to supporting you and my successor to achieve that from the backbenches.`

- On 14 October 2022, It was announced that Truss was again reversing policy in the Budget, specifically to scrap the planned rise in corporation tax from 19% to 25%.
    
    - `Liz Truss has confirmed a corporation tax U-turn after sacking Kwasi Kwarteng as chancellor.  
    -   
    - She reversed her policy to scrap the planned rise in corporation tax from 19% to 25% - meaning it will now go ahead.`

### 3rd U-Turn
- On 17 October 2022, Hunt announced in a statement to the House of Commons that most of the tax cuts in the original mini-budget that haven't progressed as bills in parliament were being axed.
    
    - `Jeremy Hunt has scrapped nearly all tax cuts announced in last month's mini-Budget, including deferring a 1p cut to income tax "indefinitely" and axing a proposed cut to corporation tax in a major U-turn for Liz Truss' Government.  
    -   
    - He said: "No government can control markets but every government can give certainty about the sustainability of public finances... We will reverse almost all the tax measures in growth plan. At a time when markets are rightly demanding a commitment to sustainable finances it is not right to borrow to fund this."`  
    - [link](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2022/10/18/key-points-jeremy-hunt-statement-mean-economy/)
    
    - Hunt’s statement to the Commons `the Prime Minister and I agreed yesterday to reverse almost all the tax measures announced in the Growth Plan three weeks ago that have not been legislated for in Parliament. So we will continue with the abolition of the Health and Social Care Levy, changes to Stamp Duty, the increase in the Annual Investment Allowance to £1 million, and the wider reforms to investment taxes. But we will no longer be proceeding with: The cut to dividend tax rates, saving around £1 billion a year. The reversal of the off-payroll working reforms introduced in 2017 and 2021, saving around £2 billion a year. The new VAT-free shopping scheme for non-UK visitors, saving a further £2 billion a year. Or the freeze to alcohol duty rates, saving around £600 million a year.` [link](https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/chancellor-statement-17-october)

    - In line with its financial stability objective, the Bank of England stands ready to restore market functioning and reduce any risks from contagion to credit conditions for UK households and businesses.  
    -   
    - To achieve this, the Bank will carry out temporary purchases of long-dated UK government bonds from 28 September. The purpose of these purchases will be to restore orderly market conditions. The purchases will be carried out on whatever scale is necessary to effect this outcome. The operation will be fully indemnified by HM Treasury.`

- On 28 September 2022, It was revealed that the reason for the Bank of England’s intervention was because of a response from the markets which, if continued without such intervention, would of led to the collapse of the British Pension system.
    
    - `The Bank of England's dramatic intervention today was in response to a "run dynamic" emerging in the British pensions system which could have resulted in the collapse of a swathe of institutions within hours, Sky News understands.  
    -   
    - Bank staff worked through the night on Tuesday and into Wednesday morning to prepare the unprecedented package, which will see it buying up a potentially limitless number of targeted government bonds.`

- On 28 September 2022, The Treasury announced that they had no plans to change course with the budget proposals.
    
    - `Treasury minister Andrew Griffith said the government's proposals were the "right plans" to grow the UK economy.  
    -   
    - He claimed "every major economy is dealing with exactly the same issues" and said the impact of "Putin's war in Ukraine is cascading through things like the cost of energy, some of the supply side implications of that".`

- On 29 September 2022, The Bank of England’s Chief Economist and Executive Director for Monetary Analysis, Huw Pill, in a speech said,
    
    - `These operations do not create central bank money on a lasting basis. As a result they will not shift the underlying macroeconomically-relevant monetary trends in the economy, which ultimately pin down developments in the price level. They are not intended to cap or control longer-term interest rates or to offer more favourable underlying financing conditions to the institutions involved – or, for that matter, to the Government – than would have prevailed in an orderly market environment.  
    -   
    - In the spirit of the famous Bagehot rule addressing the threat of bank deposit runs, yesterday’s intervention is intended to prevent painful, adverse self-fulfilling market dynamics emerging.  
    -   
    - That is why yesterday’s intervention is a “temporary and targeted financial stability operation”. It is intended to allow the inevitable and necessary re-pricing of financial assets stemming from recent macroeconomic news – including last week’s fiscal announcements – to take place in an orderly way.`

- On 2 October 2022, Truss admitted that ground should have been laid for tax cuts and that the Chancellor, Kwarteng, didn't discuss the top level cut with the rest of the cabinet.
    
    - `Liz Truss has admitted she should have "laid the ground better" for her mini-budget, after it sparked days of market turmoil.  
    -   
    - The prime minister told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg she had "learned from that", but she was confident her tax cutting package would boost economic growth.  
    -   
    - She added a decision to cut the top earner tax rate was a "decision that the chancellor made".  
    -   
    - And she revealed it was not discussed with the whole cabinet beforehand.`

### Lack Of OBR Forecasting
- Before the budgets announcement, Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng refused to let the Office for Budget Responsibility release forecasts on the mini-budget.
    
    - `Kwasi Kwarteng has refused to let a government watchdog assess the economic impact of planned tax cuts expected in a mini-budget on Friday.  
    -   
    - Mel Stride, the Tory chair of the Treasury select committee, urged Kwarteng to allow independent forecasts for the public finances to be published alongside his mini-budget on Friday. Stride released a strongly worded statement urging more clarity around the effects of the new chancellor’s fiscal interventions.`  
    - [link](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/sep/20/kwasi-kwarteng-urged-to-allow-release-of-obr-forecasts-with-mini-budget)
    
- On 30 September 2022, A reply letter between the SNP Leader of the Commons, Ian Blackford and the Chair of the Office of Budget Responsibility revealing that the OBR were not commissioned by the Chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng to produce a forecast on the mini budget but expressed they were prepared to based on the remit of the OBR.
    
    - `As we set out in our letter to the Chair of the Treasury Committee on 26 August, we took steps over the summer to prepare a forecast to coincide with the election of the new Prime Minister and any subsequent fiscal policy announcements. We sent a draft economic and fiscal forecast to the new Chancellor on 6 September, his first day in office. We offered, at the time, to update that forecast to take account of subsequent data and to reflect the economic and fiscal impact of any policies the Government announced in time for it to be published alongside the ‘fiscal event’ planned for later in the month.  
    -   
    - In the event, we were not commissioned to produce an updated forecast alongside the Chancellor’s Growth Plan on 23 September, although we would have been in a position to do so to a standard that satisfied the legal requirements of the Charter for Budget Responsibility enacted by Parliament`  
    - [link](https://obr.uk//docs/dlm_uploads/Sep2022_IBlackfordMP_forecast.pdf)
    
- On 3 October 2022, The Commons Treasury committee announced that it was beginning to investigate the lack of OBR Forecast published after listening to evidence from major UK economic experts which dismissed both the proposed growth numbers touted by Truss and claims of the reaction by the Bank of England to this package being a worldwide problem, not a UK specific problem.
    
    - `Senior economists have dismissed Liz Truss’s chances of reaching 2.5% economic growth in the next few years, as they said her government’s “guerrilla tactics” in last month’s mini-budget played a major role in spooking markets.  
    -   
    - Speaking to the Commons Treasury committee, the economists said the 2.5% growth target was “almost impossible”. The committee has launched its own investigation into the mini-budget in the absence of a formal forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility.  
    -   
    - The economists also dismissed the arguments of Jacob Rees-Mogg, the business secretary, that turmoil in pension funds had been caused by global factors alone, and warned that Kwasi Kwarteng, the chancellor, would need to unveil either spending cuts or tax increases to reassure markets in a promised statement on 31 October.  
    -   
    - Answering questions from the cross-party committee of MPs, Jagjit Chadha, the head of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) thinktank, said confidence had been badly undermined by “what can only be described as guerrilla tactics against our independent economic institutions over the summer: the Treasury, the Bank of England and the OBR”.  
    -   
    - He said: “There was a sense in which there was undermining of the cooperative arrangements that we had between the monetary and financial institutions, that theoretically and in practice have led to lower interest rates and lower deficits than would otherwise have to be the case.`

- On 23 September 2022, A letter between the SNP Leader of the Commons, Ian Blackford and the Chair of the Office of Budget Responsibility showed the OBR being asked for clarity around the lack of economic forecasting.
    
    - `...given today’s events on the financial markets we particularly believe urgent updates and forecasts are needed on the following.  
    -   
    - • A renewed forecast on mortgage costs for households facing rising interest rates.  
    - • The impact of the plummeting pound on imports, especially food prices ahead of this winter.  
    - • And the immediate and long-term cost of increased bond borrowing on the public finances.  
    -   
    - We believe your office’s independent analysis is essential if we are to fully understand the depth of the damage done by the Chancellor in today’s statement. Families and businesses need to know the consequences of the political choices made by this reckless UK government.  
    -   
    - We look forward to your response`

### Economic Analysis
- On 23 September 2022, The Institute for Fiscal Studies released a response to the budget proposal which said:
    
    - `Paul Johnson, IFS Director, said:  
    -   
    - Today, the Chancellor announced the biggest package of tax cuts in 50 years without even a semblance of an effort to make the public finance numbers add up. Instead, the plan seems to be to borrow large sums at increasingly expensive rates, put government debt on an unsustainable rising path, and hope that we get better growth.  
    -   
    - ...  
    -   
    - The Government’s costing of the Energy Price Guarantee for households and non-domestic consumers - £60 billion over the next six months - means that borrowing this year is now on course to climb to £190 billion. At 7.5% of national income this would make it the third-highest peak in borrowing since the Second World War, after the Global Financial Crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic.  
    -   
    - By 2026-27 we now forecast that borrowing will be over £110 billion - 3.9% of GDP - which is more than £80 billion higher than the £32 billion forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility in March. Over half of this increase in borrowing is due to the almost £45 billion a year of tax cuts announced by the Chancellor today.`  
    - [link](https://ifs.org.uk/articles/mini-budget-response)
    
- On 24 September 2022, The Resolution Foundation released a response to the budget proposal which said:
    
    - `The tax cuts confirmed yesterday are strongly focused on higher-income households, driven by the reversal of the rise in National Insurance and the scrapping of the additional 45p rate of Income Tax, along with associated cuts to Dividend Tax. Next year they will see someone earning £200,000 gain £5,220 a year, with the gain rising to £55,220 for a £1 million earner. Those on £20,000 will gain just £157. The result is that almost half (47 per cent) of the gains will go to the richest 5 per cent of households, compared to 12 per cent for the entire poorer half. Moreover, those living in the South East or London will see over three-times (on average, £1,600) the gains of those in the North East, Wales and Yorkshire (an average of £500). The South is also where the main impact of a welcome cut to Stamp Duty will be felt: the tax bill on the sale of the average first-time buyer home in London will fall by £6,300, compared to no gain for the average first-time buyer in the North East.  
    -   
    - This package of tax cuts largely reverses rises announced by Rishi Sunak in recent years, but does not do so entirely: the four-year freeze to income tax thresholds remains in place. The scale of that freeze in an era of high inflation means that the vast majority of earners will still see their personal taxes increased when all tax changes announced during this Parliament are taken into account. Those earning under £155,000 will see their tax bill increase or be unaffected, with only those earning over £155,000 will receive a net tax cut thanks to the scrapping of the 45p tax rate. Workers earning between £63,000 and £125,000 lose the most (almost £1,500 in 2025-26). A similar pattern can be seen among households, even considering increases to benefit generosity as well: only the top 5 per cent will see significant income gains from policy changes (averaging £2,520 by 2025-26). Despite the rhetoric, tax as a share of the economy remains at its highest sustained level since the 1940s (at around 35 per cent of GDP).`

### 1st U-Turn
- On 3 October 2022, Truss and Kwarteng axed the idea to remove the top rate of income tax.
    
    - `Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng has confirmed that the government is axing plans to give the wealthiest 1% a tax cut following a bitter backlash from Tory MPs.  
    -   
    - Mr Kwarteng said in a tweet that the measure had become a "distraction" from his objective to grow the economy.  
    -   
    - He said: "We get it, we have listened."`

### 2nd U-Turn & Kwarteng Sacking
- On 14 October 2022, after further economic turmoil, It was announced that Truss had replaced Kwarteng as Chancellor of the Exchequer with Jeremy Hunt along with replacing Chris Philip as Chief Secetary to the Treasury with Edward Argar.
    
    - Kwarteng Resignation Letter: `You have asked me to stand aside as your Chancellor. I have accepted.  
    -   
    - When you asked me to serve as your Chancellor, I did so in full knowledge that the situation we faced was incredibly difficult. with rising global interest rates and energy prices. However. your vision of optimism, growth and change was right.  
    -   
    - As I have said many times in the past weeks. following the status quo was simply not an option. For too long this country has been dogged by low growth rates and high taxation — that must still change if this country is to succeed.  
    -   
    - The economic environment has changed rapidly since we set out the Growth Plan on 23 September. In response, together with the Bank of England and excellent officials at the Treasury we have responded to those events, and I commend my officials for their dedication. It is important now as we move forward to emphasise your government's commitment to fiscal discipline. The Medium-Term Fiscal Plan is crucial to this end, and 1 look formed to supporting you and my successor to achieve that from the backbenches.`

- On 14 October 2022, It was announced that Truss was again reversing policy in the Budget, specifically to scrap the planned rise in corporation tax from 19% to 25%.
    
    - `Liz Truss has confirmed a corporation tax U-turn after sacking Kwasi Kwarteng as chancellor.  
    -   
    - She reversed her policy to scrap the planned rise in corporation tax from 19% to 25% - meaning it will now go ahead.`

### 3rd U-Turn
- On 17 October 2022, Hunt announced in a statement to the House of Commons that most of the tax cuts in the original mini-budget that haven't progressed as bills in parliament were being axed.
    
    - `Jeremy Hunt has scrapped nearly all tax cuts announced in last month's mini-Budget, including deferring a 1p cut to income tax "indefinitely" and axing a proposed cut to corporation tax in a major U-turn for Liz Truss' Government.  
    -   
    - He said: "No government can control markets but every government can give certainty about the sustainability of public finances... We will reverse almost all the tax measures in growth plan. At a time when markets are rightly demanding a commitment to sustainable finances it is not right to borrow to fund this."`  
    - [link](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2022/10/18/key-points-jeremy-hunt-statement-mean-economy/)
    
    - Hunt’s statement to the Commons `the Prime Minister and I agreed yesterday to reverse almost all the tax measures announced in the Growth Plan three weeks ago that have not been legislated for in Parliament. So we will continue with the abolition of the Health and Social Care Levy, changes to Stamp Duty, the increase in the Annual Investment Allowance to £1 million, and the wider reforms to investment taxes. But we will no longer be proceeding with: The cut to dividend tax rates, saving around £1 billion a year. The reversal of the off-payroll working reforms introduced in 2017 and 2021, saving around £2 billion a year. The new VAT-free shopping scheme for non-UK visitors, saving a further £2 billion a year. Or the freeze to alcohol duty rates, saving around £600 million a year.` [link](https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/chancellor-statement-17-october)
