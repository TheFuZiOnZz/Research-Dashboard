- On 26 October 2021, Owen Paterson was found in a report by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards to have breached paid advocacy rules for making three approaches to the Food Standards Agency and four approaches to the Department for International Development in relation to Randox and seven approaches to the Food Standards Agency relating to Lynn's Country Foods. The Commons Select Committee on Standards recommended Paterson be suspended from the Commons for 30 sitting days.
    
    > `The Committee found that Mr Paterson’s actions were an egregious case of paid advocacy, that he repeatedly used his privileged position to benefit two companies for whom he was a paid consultant, and that this has brought the House into disrepute. In line with previous cases of a similar severity, the Committee recommends that Mr Paterson be suspended from the service of the House for 30 sitting days.` [link](https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/290/committee-on-standards/news/158246/committee-on-standards-publish-report-on-the-conduct-of-rt-hon-owen-paterson-mp/)
    
    > `I have found that Mr Paterson acted in breach of paragraph 11 of the 2015 Code of Conduct, which prohibits paid advocacy, in respect of approaches he made to the FSA and DfID. Mr Paterson has told me that he was acting as a “whistle-blower” under the exemption provided in paragraph 9 of Chapter 3 of the Guide to the Rules. I accept that he was entitled to this exemption in respect of the approach he made in November 2016, and the meeting he attended on 15 November 2016. But I do not accept that he was entitled to this exemption in his follow up meetings and correspondence as these were intended to benefit his clients rather than to raise a serious wrong.  
    >   
    > I consider that Mr Paterson was not entitled to the whistle-blowing exemption, and therefore breached paragraph 11 of the Code in his approaches to the FSA, on behalf of Lynn’s and to DfID on behalf of Randox as these were also intended to benefit his clients rather than to raise a serious wrong. He also brought no evidence to FSA and DfID about serious wrongs.  
    >   
    > Mr Paterson has stated that when addressing a serious wrong, the rules on lobbying do not apply. This is not the case. By Mr Paterson’s application of the rules, any Member dealing with a serious matter could use that as a platform to benefit a company by whom they are paid. The correct interpretation of the rule is that it allows a Member to bring evidence of a serious wrong or substantial injustice to the responsible Minister or official, even if it would have the incidental effect of conferring a financial or material benefit on the organisation which paid him or her. Mr Paterson was seeking benefit for his clients. In those circumstances that benefit to his clients would not be ‘incidental’ but an intended outcome of the approach.`

    > `Paterson, a former Northern Ireland secretary and prominent Brexit campaigner, claimed the investigation was biased and “offends against the basic standard of procedural fairness that no one should be found guilty until they have had a chance to be heard and to present their evidence including their witnesses”. He said Stone did not speak to him to get his side of the story until after she had “made up her mind” and did not seek oral evidence from 17 witnesses who wanted to testify in his support. “I am not guilty and a fair process would exonerate me,” he added.` [link](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/oct/26/owen-paterson-faces-suspension-breaking-lobbying-rules)
    
- On 5 November 2021, Owen Paterson resigned from the House of Commons amid controversy surrounding a report by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards that found that he had broken paid advocacy rules.
    
    > `I have today, after consultation with my family, and with much sadness decided to resign as the MP for North Shropshire.  
    >   
    > The last two years have been an indescribable nightmare for my family and me.  
    >   
    > My integrity, which I hold very dear, has been repeatedly and publicly questioned.  
    >   
    > I maintain that I am totally innocent of what I have been accused of and I acted at all times in the interests of public health and safety.  
    >   
    > I, my family and those closest to me know the same. I am unable to clear my name under the current system.`

The High Court was also clear that the Prime Minister broke the law in appointing Dido Harding as Chair of Test and Trace.  
    >   
    > The Court declared: “The Secretary of State for Health and Social Care did not comply with the Public Sector Equality Duty in section 149 of the Equality Act 2010 in relation to the decisions on how to appoint (i) Baroness Harding as Interim Chair of the National Institute of Health Protection in August 2020 and (ii) Mike Coupe as Director of Testing for NHS Test and Trace in September 2020.”`
