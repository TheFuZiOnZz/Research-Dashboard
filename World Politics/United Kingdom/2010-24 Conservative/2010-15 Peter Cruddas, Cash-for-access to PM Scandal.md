Specifically, it was categorically not the case that I could offer, or that David Cameron would consider, any access as a result of a donation. Similarly, I have never knowingly even met anyone from the Number 10 policy unit.` - [link](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/mar/25/peter-cruddas-resigns-cash-access)
