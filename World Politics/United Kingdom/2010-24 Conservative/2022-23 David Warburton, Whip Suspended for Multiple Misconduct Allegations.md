    -   
    - The Conservative whips office said he had been suspended from the parliamentary party while the investigation was ongoing.  
    -   
    - Conservative sources said there were three allegations of sexual harassment. The investigation was launched by the Parliament's Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS) following allegations about Mr Warburton's conduct in the Sunday Times newspaper.  
    -   
    - The newspaper said three women have complained about Mr Warburton's conduct.`

- On 2 April 2022, The Sunday Times released an article about the sex and drugs allegations. [link](https://archive.ph/gu3gw)
    - Warburton allegedly asked Woman 1 for cocaine to be bought on his behalf.
        
        - `He is said to have snorted “line after line after line” of the drug at the London home of a younger woman in the early hours of February 1. He had met her through politics and allegedly insisted on coming over, despite evidence that she was drunk.  
        -   
        - Hours earlier Warburton, a 56-year-old married father of two and former businessman, had asked the woman to order the class A drugs on his behalf, telling her he would pay for them. According to an audio recording, he dismissed the suggestion that paying £160 for two grams was “spenny” — expensive — and said it was “quite good actually”.`  
        
    - Warburton allegedly, also made unwanted sexual advancements towards Woman 1.
        
        - `She recounts that as she became less drunk she grew uncomfortable that the pair were alone together and retreated to her bedroom to put on her pyjamas in an attempt to encourage his departure. When she emerged, she says, Warburton was naked. He allegedly explained that he always slept nude and climbed into her bed. Fearful of how he might react, she did not push him away, she says, or demand that he leave.  
        -   
        - Despite her repeated and explicit warnings, before and during his visit, that she did not want to have sex with him or do anything sexual, Warburton allegedly ground his body against hers and groped her breasts. The woman says she lay frozen until the MP fell asleep, snoring loudly.  
        -   
        - The following morning Warburton is said to have woken up and asked her if she was “proud” that an MP had slept at her home. She says she showed him the door, then had a long shower. She felt ashamed and violated. At 1.50pm he sent her a WhatsApp message asking if she was available and stating: “Promise I won’t remove all my clothes again.” The pair have not met since.  
        -   
        - The woman did not make a complaint to the police or any other authority. She says Warburton was a powerful man and she would not have known which course of action to take. She also says she wanted to forget about the incident.`  
        
    - Warburton allegedly had received a large donation that wasn't declared from a FCA limited Russian Financial Adviser.
        
        - `He borrowed £100,000 from a Russian businessman without declaring it, a decision that could lead to an investigation by the parliamentary commissioner for standards.  
        -   
        - The man who lent him the money is Roman Joukovski, a financial adviser who has specialised in offshore tax advice and providing tier-one “golden” investor visas to foreign citizens, including oligarchs and the family of Kazakhstan’s dictator Nursultan Nazarbayev. In 2014 the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) refused to certify him as a “fit and proper person”, limiting his ability to provide certain kinds of financial advice, and one of his businesses was recently forced into insolvency after a separate FCA ruling.  
        -   
        - Warburton knew about Joukovski’s past problems with the regulator, but took the loan via an offshore entity linked to the businessman’s family trust. He later brought the Russian-born British citizen into the Palace of Westminster and used his parliamentary email address to organise meetings for Joukovski, including one with Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Brexit opportunities secretary, who was a backbencher at the time in 2017. According to a source with direct knowledge of the transaction, Warburton has since repaid the money at high levels of interest.  
        -   
        - Parliamentary rules state that MPs must register an interest, in this case a loan, within 28 days if it has any bearing on their parliamentary activities. If an MP has any doubt about whether an interest should be declared, they are advised to do so. At no point has Warburton disclosed any details of his financial relationship with Joukovski.`  
        
    - During the pandemic, Warburton was using more cocaine and involved in more incidents of Warburton being sexually inappropriate to Woman 2 and Woman 3.
        
        - `During the pandemic, Warburton’s life changed. He increasingly spent time away from home, in his taxpayer-funded flat in County Hall, across the Thames from parliament. His wife remained in Somerset caring for their children. Then, in January last year, Warburton posted a photograph revealing he had lost eight stone by lifting weights and avoiding carbohydrates. His selfie prompted congratulations from the prime minister, the health secretary and others.  
        -   
        - Warburton was living increasingly recklessly. He started sending suggestive texts to at least one younger woman whom he had met through politics but did not work for him last year. It also appears that he took cocaine, writing to the woman in November to say: “Yep have some cheeky coke obvs.” Last month he texted her saying: “Does your dealer do Westminster Bridge area!?” He added: “Have just been put on a one line-whip” — meaning that he was not obliged to participate in votes in the Commons that day — “so your happy Monday has made me want to call my dealer ... but he takes aeons.”  
        -   
        - The two women who have reported him allege that Warburton started behaving inappropriately towards them too, both in parliament and at late-night events in and around Westminster. The conduct varied in its severity. He is said to have subjected one female aide to months of sexualised comments, telling her he would have slept with her had they been the same age and refusing to stop calling her “baby”. At the British Kebab awards, a boozy event in Westminster attended by MPs and young researchers, he allegedly groped her thigh in an incident witnessed by another person.  
        -   
        - The two women allege that Warburton pressured them into drinking more alcohol than they were comfortable with and that he coerced them into returning to his flat. In one incident alleged to have taken place this year, he told an aide to return with him to the property, where, against her will, he allegedly kissed her forehead, stroked her hair, placed his hand on her thigh and repeatedly rubbed it. The other female staff member recounted an incident in which he had caressed her and refused to let her leave his home, marshalling her back inside when she sought to leave.`  
        
- On 21 November 2022, Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, Kathryn Stone, found that there were two breaches of the code of conduct but the breaches had been rectified after Warburton wrote to Stone.
    
    - `During my inquiry, I established that the loan had been provided to Mr Warburton by Mr Roman Joukovski in August 2017 through an intermediary company, Castlebrook Associates Limited (Seychelles). I also established that the loan was for a personal matter and was not provided on a free or concessionary basis. My inquiry established that during the period that the loan was active (it was repaid in March 2022), Mr Warburton assisted Mr Joukovski in his dealings with the FCA. I determined that this assistance was provided in a personal capacity. I was also satisfied on the evidence that the loan had not influenced Mr Warburton's words or actions as a Member.  
    -   
    - Mr Warburton told me that he did not register the loan at the time because it was “…entirely unconnected with either my role as an MP or any parliamentary activities” and also told me "in no way did (the loan) ever influence my words or actions as a Member. Nor could it have done".  
    -   
    - After taking advice from the Registrar of Members' Financial Interests, I concluded that the loan should have been registered under Category 8 of the Register of Members' Financial Interests as a miscellaneous financial interest. I reached this conclusion because an onlooker might have reasonably thought that at the time the loan was provided it had the potential to influence Mr Warburton's words or actions as a Member. I decided that the failure to register the loan amounted to a breach of paragraph 14 of the Code.  
    -   
    - I also concluded that the loan should have been declared when Mr Warburton wrote to the FCA about Mr Joukovski on 12 March 2021. This is because an onlooker might reasonably have thought that the loan was either influencing the words in Mr Warburton's reference or had influenced Mr Warburton's decision to write a reference. I decided that the failure to declare the loan when writing to the FCA amounted to a further breach of paragraph 14 of the Code.  
    -   
    - However, I decided that the letter of reference submitted by Mr Warburton did not amount to paid advocacy and was not a breach of paragraph 12 of the Code. This is because the letter sent by Mr Warburton did not suggest that the FCA should take any positive action in respect of Mr Joukovski, nor did it make any representations on Mr Joukovski’s behalf. I was therefore satisfied that the letter was not seeking to confer "a financial or material benefit” on Mr Joukovski. I was also mindful that the letter was submitted substantially outside the six-month time limit set by the House's paid advocacy rules.`

- On 17 June 2023, Warburton announced his intention to resign from Parliament, citing his feeling that the parliamentary harassment watchdog denied him a fair hearing over claims he harassed two women. He admitted to taking cocaine after drinking whisky with a third woman.
    
    - `A Conservative MP accused of sexual harassment and drug abuse has resigned - triggering a by-election in his Somerton and Frome constituency.  
    -   
    - David Warburton, 57, was suspended from the party in April 2022 pending the outcome of an Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS) investigation into the allegations.  
    -   
    - He claimed he had been denied a fair hearing by the ICGS and prevented from "speaking out" while it probed the claims.  
    -   
    - ...  
    -   
    - In his resignation letter, Mr Warburton said the "malicious allegations" and "flawed" 14-month investigation had "inflicted unimaginable and intolerable destruction on my family and on me".  
    -   
    - He said had been left with "no choice" but to provoke "the upheaval of a by-election", adding: "It is my hope that, in so doing, I can freely illuminate the methods of an oversight system not fit for purpose, so that friends and colleagues in the House can see the perverted process by which their own judgement may at any time be freighted."  
    -   
    - He claimed the ICGS "prevented" him from speaking out and that it "moves at a cripplingly glacial pace towards a predetermined conclusion".`
