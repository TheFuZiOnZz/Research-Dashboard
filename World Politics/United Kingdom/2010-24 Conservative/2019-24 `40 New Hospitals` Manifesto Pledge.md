- On 2 October 2020, Johnson announced funding for the manifesto pledge.
    
    - `The Prime Minister today confirmed for the first time that 40 hospitals will be built by 2030 as part of a package worth £3.7 billion, with 8 further new schemes invited to bid, delivering on the government’s manifesto commitment.  
    -   
    - New standards will be developed over the coming months to help standardise the design of new hospitals and make use of modular construction methods to speed up the build.  
    -   
    - The health infrastructure plan (HIP) is the biggest hospital building programme in a generation. It launched last September with a £2.8 billion investment that gave 6 new hospitals the funding to go ahead, alongside seed funding for trusts to work up business cases.`

- On 4 February 2023, The Observer reported that 25% of that hospitals secured full planning permission.
    
    - `Only a quarter of the 40 hospital construction projects that were at the heart of Boris Johnson’s 2019 general election manifesto have secured full planning permission, the Observer can reveal, amid angry claims from NHS figures that there is no chance the schemes will be delivered on time.  
    -   
    - Ministers have repeatedly claimed that the hospitals will be delivered by 2030, despite concerns from health chiefs and economists that “woefully insufficient” funding and rising costs will scupper the plan and put NHS capacity at risk.  
    -   
    - However, an investigation by the Observer has revealed that only 10 of the 40 projects have the full planning permissions they need to go ahead. Those involved in some of the projects said they had already faced lengthy delays, leaving them with decrepit and often unusable buildings.  
    -   
    - “There’s a 0% chance there’s going to be 40 new hospitals by 2030,” said the boss of one of the NHS trusts awaiting a new hospital. “We’ll be moderately lucky to have eight. At the moment we’re doing loads of maintenance work on an ongoing basis, trying to sort out roofs and theatres and all those things. Some hospitals are literally falling down.”  
    -   
    - Analysis by the Observer, combined with official data obtained by the Lib Dem deputy leader, Daisy Cooper, reveals that some projects only have outline planning permission, which is insufficient to allow building work to commence. Many of the projects have no planning permission at all.`

- On 28 May 2023, Health Secretary Steve Barclay admits 40 new hospitals will not be built by 2030.
    
    - `Mr Barclay’s admission came as he was interviewed by the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg. Urging the health secretary to “be straight” with the public, she said: “If you save up and get a new conservatory on the back of your house, you don’t have a new house.  
    -   
    - “Can you be honest with people [and admit that] you are not building 40 brand new hospitals?” Mr Barclay replied: “Well, some of the schemes include a hospital being gutted and fully refurbished.”`

- Johnson's `40 new hospitals` Manifesto pledge faces watchdog review.
    
    - `The Conservatives' 2019 election pledge to build 40 new hospitals by 2030 faces a review by the government's spending watchdog. Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting asked for an investigation into delays surrounding the programme and warned of taxpayers' money being wasted. The National Audit Office (NAO) intends to conduct a "value for money review" later this year, its comptroller said. Mr Streeting accused the Tories of "overpromising and underdelivering".` [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-62025410)
