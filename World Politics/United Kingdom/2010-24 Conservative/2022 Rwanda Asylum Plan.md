### 2022 Rwanda Asylum Plan
### Human Rights
- In the UN Refugee Convention 1951, Article 31 states that refugees cannot be penalised for entering the country illegally to claim asylum.
    
    - `The Contracting States shall not impose penalties, on account of their illegal entry or presence, on refugees who, coming directly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened in the sense of Article 1, enter or are present in their territory without authorization, provided they present themselves without delay to the authorities and show good cause for their illegal entry or presence.` [link](https://www.unhcr.org/libraries/pdf.js/web/viewer.html?file=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.unhcr.org%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Flegacy-pdf%2F4ca34be29.pdf?version1692333666)
    
- On 2 January 2019, immigration lawyer Colin Yeo wrote that under the UN Refugee Convention, there is no obligation on refugees to claim asylum in the first safe country they reach.
    
    - `there is no obligation in the Refugee Convention, either explicit or implicit, to claim asylum in the first safe country reached by a refugees.` [link](https://freemovement.org.uk/are-refugees-obliged-to-claim-asylum-in-the-first-safe-country-they-reach/)
    
### France
- In July 2018, Human Rights Watch found that asylum seekers and migrants in France were not being treated as they should be according to French law.
    
    - `The French Red Cross does age assessments for unaccompanied children in Paris, delegated to do so by the department of Paris (a department is a local administrative division of France), and it has established an evaluation facility (Dispositif d’evaluation des mineurs isolés étrangers, DEMIE) for this purpose. But many children who seek legal recognition of their age report that they are turned away at the door by security guards. Others go through a short interview of approximately five minutes followed by a summary verbal denial. This treatment falls short of what is required by French law, violates international standards, and means that those who are turned away must fend for themselves or seek assistance from nongovernmental organizations to find shelter, food, and other basic necessities.` [link](https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/report_pdf/france0718_web.pdf)
    
    - Article 25 (5) of the Asylum Procedures Directive explicitly addresses age assessments and establishes that they are only appropriate if there doubts about the individual’s age and any continuing doubt about age, is to be resolved in the individual’s favor so they are treated as a child. Therefore, under EU law, age assessments should only be used if there are grounds for serious doubt about an individual’s age, and never as a routine practice. This is consistent with recommendations from other bodies such as the Committee on the Rights of the Child and UNHCR.` [link](https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/report_pdf/france0718_web.pdf)
    
- In June 2020, it was found that 80% of refugees in Calais & Dunkirk had been there for more than 4 years waiting for their refugee application to be complete.
    
    - `A field poll carried out by the French Red Cross in June 2020, of more than 80 people living in makeshift camps around Calais and Dunkirk in Northern France, found it had been more than four years since they were first forced to leave their homes, on average.` [link](https://www.redcross.org.uk/stories/migration-and-displacement/refugees-and-asylum-seekers/5-reasons-people-cross-the-channel)
    
- At the end of 2020, the UK saw a sizable uptick in the number of Asylum Seekers arriving on small boats across the English Channel from Calais & Dunkirk, France.
    
    - `while there was an initial increase in small boats detections in 2019, recorded detections on other routes remained relatively stable. Small boat arrivals increased further in 2020 as detections on other routes declined, likely in part due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic making other methods of entry such as air or ferry less viable. However, in 2021 and 2022, there was a substantial increase in the numbers of small boat arrivals. This occurred despite the other entry methods becoming more viable as global COVID-19 restrictions eased.` [link](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/irregular-migration-to-the-uk-year-ending-december-2022/irregular-migration-to-the-uk-year-ending-december-2022)
    
### Rwanda
- Between 2013 and 2018, Rwanda had a migrant deal with Israel like the Rwandan-UK Migrant deal. Some 4,000 Eritrean and Sudanese asylum seekers based in Israel were sent to Rwanda and Uganda between 2013 and 2018, before the secretive arrangement was abandoned and almost all are thought to have left the country almost immediately, with many attempting to return to Europe via people-smuggling routes.
    
    - `Rwanda signed a similar agreement with Israel between 2014 and 2017 that was not a success, with almost of all of the 4,000 detainees sent there swiftly leaving the country to undertake the perilous journey to Europe, some of whom are understood to have fallen prey to human traffickers en route, notably in Libya.` [[u]]
    
    - `Then-minister of interior Gideon Sa’ar, announces that Israel has signed agreements with “third countries”, and that the departure of “infiltrators” to these countries has begun in limited numbers. According to the Population and Immigration Authority, 1,093 asylum seekers were deported to third countries during 2014.` [link](https://hotline.org.il/en/refugees-and-asylum-seekers-en/voluntary-departure/)
    
    - the state admitted for the first time that no operative procedure to forcibly deport asylum seekers from Israel exists; thus, beginning on April 17 (2018), the ministry of interior ceased holding pre-deportation hearings, and now declared that all deportation notices previously given are obsolete. It was further declared that “infiltrators” whose visa expired – will have it renewed for a period of 60 days, as was the norm before the deportation. Additionally, it was clarified that the “voluntary departure” route to a third country is still available, and will be offered to every asylum seekers during his or her visa renewal, though the renewal of the visa will not be conditioned upon it.` [link](https://hotline.org.il/en/refugees-and-asylum-seekers-en/voluntary-departure/)
    
    - `These asylum seekers are sent to Uganda and Rwanda with a promise from the Israeli authorities that they will be provided with the necessary papersto enable them to stay legally in the receiving country. However, our findings show that, in reality, they do not receive any legal status: they are left with no valid legal documents upon arrival and are either encouraged to leave these countries, live below the radar and without legal status, and/or hide the fact that they came from Israel.  
    -   
    - For those asylum seekers who are sent to Rwanda, testimonies collected by IRRI suggest that the majority, if not all, are being smuggled out of the country by land to Kampala within days of arriving in Kigali. They are not given an opportunity to apply for asylum, and even if they wish to stay in Rwanda, their refugee claims cannot be assessed as the national refugee status determination committee has not yet been established. These transfers appear to be coordinated by the people who receive the asylum seekers at Kigali airport. From Kampala, the majority travel north to South Sudan, Sudan and Libya, with many ultimately risking crossing the Mediterranean or falling into the hands of the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) in the hope of finding safety in Europe.`

- On 8 July 2021, The UK's International Ambassador for Human Rights Rita French, delivered a statement during the Universal Periodic Review Adoption for Rwanda condemning Human Rights abuses.
    
    - `The UK is pleased that Rwanda fully supports our recommendation to protect and enable journalists to work freely, without fear of retribution, and ensure that State authorities comply with the access to information law. This is an important step to promote freedom of speech, including allowing space for critical voices.  
    -   
    - We regret that Rwanda did not support our recommendation, which was also made by other States, to conduct transparent, credible and independent investigations into allegations of human rights violations including deaths in custody and torture.  
    -   
    - We welcome that Rwanda accepted recommendations from other countries on combatting human trafficking, but we were disappointed that Rwanda did not support the UK recommendation to screen, identify and provide support to trafficking victims, including those held in Government transit centres. In recognising the progress made by Rwanda, the UK encourages Rwanda to submit an optional mid-term report to provide an update on implementation of recommendations, between reviews.`

- In the Human Rights Watch - World Report 2021, Rwanda is described by many abuses of human rights involving political suppression, poorly treated detainees and unfair application of judicial practice amongst others.
    
    - `The ruling Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) continued to target those perceived as a threat to the government during 2020. Several high-profile government critics were arrested or threatened. Authorities failed to conduct credible investigations into the suspicious death in police custody of well-known singer and activist, Kizito Mihigo, in February.  
    -   
    - Arbitrary detention, ill-treatment, and torture in official and unofficial detention facilities continued. Fair trial standards were routinely flouted in many sensitive political cases, in which security-related charges are often used to prosecute prominent government critics.`

### The Plan
- On 14 April 2022, the Home Secretary Priti Patel announced a new plan to send refugees entering the UK to Rwanda to complete their asylum applications.
    
    - `The government has today (Thursday 14 April) set out bold new plans to tackle illegal migration, control our borders and crack down on the criminal gangs exploiting this international crisis.` [link](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/world-first-partnership-to-tackle-global-migration-crisis)
    
    - `Under this Partnership the UK is investing £120 million into the economic development and growth of Rwanda. Funding will also be provided to support the delivery of asylum operations, accommodation and integration, similar to the costs incurred in the UK for these services.` [link](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/world-first-partnership-to-tackle-global-migration-crisis)
    
    - `Alongside this action, which will disrupt the business model of people-smuggling gangs, the military will also now take operational command of responding to small boats in the Channel, in partnership with Border Force. This will happen with immediate effect, and be backed up by £50 million in new funding. This change will deliver new boats, aerial surveillance and expert military personnel. In doing so it will bolster Border Force teams and their existing patrol vessels and provide a Wildcat helicopter.` [link](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/world-first-partnership-to-tackle-global-migration-crisis)
    
    - `Finally, to address the unacceptable, £4.7 million per-day cost to the taxpayer from housing migrants in hotels (including those who have arrived through resettlement programmes), we will be introducing a new, nationwide dispersal system so asylum pressures are more equally spread across local authorities. We will also shortly open a new, bespoke, asylum reception centre in Linton-on-Ouse.` [link](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/world-first-partnership-to-tackle-global-migration-crisis)
    
- On 14 April 2022, Johnson defended the plan and called Rwanda one of the safest countries in the world.
    
    - `speaking at an airport in Kent, the Prime Minister said: “I just want to say something about Rwanda because I think there’s a risk of stereotyping here.  
    -   
    - “Rwanda has totally transformed over the last few decades, it’s a very, very different country from what it was.  
    -   
    - “This is not something that we’ve put together overnight, this has been nine months in preparation. So I would urge people not to think in a blinkered way about Rwanda.”  
    -   
    - He added: “Let’s be clear, Rwanda is one of the safest countries in the world, globally recognised for its record of welcoming and integrating migrants.”`  
    - [[rwandaborisjohnsongovern]]
    
- On 14 April 2022, The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) expressed she is firmly opposed to the policy saying the plan violates international law.
    
    - `“UNHCR remains firmly opposed to arrangements that seek to transfer refugees and asylum seekers to third countries in the absence of sufficient safeguards and standards. Such arrangements simply shift asylum responsibilities, evade international obligations, and are contrary to the letter and spirit of the Refugee Convention,” said UNHCR’s Assistant High Commissioner for Protection, Gillian Triggs.` [[unrefuge]]
    
- On 15 April 2022, it was reported that The Rwandan Government were seemingly unaware of the policy before its announcement.
    
    - `Victoire Ingabire said: "The population has woken up to the deal that has been signed - nobody knew about it.”  
    -   
    - "We're not ready," she added.  
    -   
    - "Because if our people don't have enough to eat, if our kids or Rwanda's kids don't have the possibility of going to school because of the poverty, how will the Rwandan government give education to the kids of refugees?"`

- On 14 June 2022, The European Court of Human Rights grounded the first scheduled flight to Rwanda, of which had 7 refugees onboard.
    
    - `Boris Johnson’s plan to send an inaugural flight of asylum seekers to Rwanda has been abandoned after a dramatic 11th-hour ruling by the European court of human rights.  
    -   
    - Up to seven people who had come to the UK seeking refuge had been expected to be removed to the east African country an hour and a half before the flight was due to take off.  
    -   
    - But a ruling by the ECHR on one of the seven cases allowed lawyers for the other six to make successful last-minute applications.`
