### 2022 Johnson’s Comments On Starmer & Saville
- On 31 January 2022, In the House of Commons, Johnson falsely blamed Starmer for the non-prosecution of serial sex offender Jimmy Savile when Starmer was Director of Public Prosecutions in the Crown Prosecution Service.
- On 3 February 2022, A Downing Street source said that Johnson still would not apologise for the slur against Starmer.
    
    - `No 10 has no intention of apologising for the PM's false claim that Sir Keir Starmer failed to prosecute Jimmy Savile, after the Labour leader was targeted by protesters near Parliament. Boris Johnson is facing fresh calls from Tory MPs to say sorry, after protesters were heard shouting about the sex offender, as well as protesting about Covid measures. But a senior source told the BBC: "He's got other stuff to get on with today." Mr Johnson did condemn the harassment.` [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-60297998)
    
- On 3 February 2022, Johnson policy adviser Munira Mirza resigned saying in her resignation letter that Johnson had made a scurrilous and inappropriate accusation against Starmer.
    
    - `It is with great regret that I am writing to resign as your Head of Policy.  
    -   
    - You are aware of the reason for my decision: I believe it was wrong for you to imply this week that Keir Starmer was personally responsible for allowing Jimmy Savile to escape justice. There was no fair or reasonable basis for that assertion. This was not the usual cut and thrust of politics; it was an inappropriate and partisan reference to a horrendous case of child sex abuse. You tried to clarify your position today but, despite my urging, you did not apologise for the misleading impression you gave.`

- In 2012, when he was Director of Public Prosecutions, Starmer commissioned a report from Alison Levitt QC called `In The Matter Of The Late Jimmy Saville` into why Savile was not prosecuted.
    
    - `One of the decisions not to prosecute was correct, but not for the reason given. No prosecution could have taken place on the evidence of Ms G because the behaviour complained of did not amount to a criminal offence. Ms G’s alleged unwillingness to give evidence was therefore immaterial.`
    
    - `In relation to the three other allegations, on the information available these were credible complaints of criminal offences based on reliable evidence. However, all three alleged victims had expressed unwillingness to attend court.`
    
    - `Taken at face value, the decisions not to prosecute in the cases of Ms E and Ms A were not unreasonable, for these reasons: there was insufficient other evidence to prosecute in the absence of the complainants’ accounts; an application to adduce their evidence under the hearsay provisions of Part 11 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 would, in my view, have failed, and issuing a witness summons against a reluctant witness in these sensitive cases must always be a matter of last resort.` [link](https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukgwa/20130703165341/http:/www.cps.gov.uk/news/assets/uploads/files/savile_report.pdf)
