### Economic Analysis
- On 17 November 2022, The Office of Budget Responsibility released a `Economic and Fiscal Outlook` Report on the Autumn Statement which said:
    
    - `The 17 November Autumn Statement announced further support in the near term – including further cost-of-living payments to those in receipt of various benefits and cuts to business rates, as well as additional spending on health and social care, and schools (rising to £5.9 billion and £2.5 billion respectively in 2024-25). These are largely financed by windfall taxes (raising the EPL rate and introducing a new tax on renewable and nuclear power not covered by contracts for difference). From 2024-25 onwards, the Autumn Statement lowers borrowing by progressively larger amounts rising to £61.7 billion (2.1 per cent of GDP) in 2027-28. Net tax rises account for half of this tightening (£31.0 billion), with £19.4 billion coming from cuts to departmental current spending and £11.8 billion from cuts to departmental capital spending.` [link](https://obr.uk/docs/dlm_uploads/CCS0822661240-002_CCS001_SECURE_OBR_EFO_November_2022_BOOKMARK.pdf)
    
    - `The measures announced since March 2022 total £64 billion in 2022-23 and £40 billion in 2023-24 (2.6 and 1.6 per cent of GDP). This boosts real incomes, supporting household consumption, so the 2.1 per cent peak-to-trough fall in GDP is a little over 1 percentage point shallower than it would have been in the absence of these policies, and the unemployment rate is 3.6 per cent in 2022-23 and 4.3 per cent in 2023-24, around 0.2 percentage points (around 70,000) lower than it would have been otherwise.` [link](https://obr.uk/docs/dlm_uploads/CCS0822661240-002_CCS001_SECURE_OBR_EFO_November_2022_BOOKMARK.pdf)
    
    - `The UK is being hit by a large terms of trade shock that is set to push inflation to its highest rate in 40 years and drive historic falls in real household disposable income. This inevitably makes households worse off. On a fiscal year basis, RHDI per person (a measure of living standards) falls by 4.3 per cent in 2022-23, which would be the largest since ONS records began in 1956-57. That is followed by the second largest fall in 2023-24 at 2.8 per cent. This would be only the third time since 1956-57 that RHDI per person has fallen for two consecutive fiscal years – the last time this happened was in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. And the 7.1 per cent cumulative fall from 2021-22 to 2023-24 is large enough to take RHDI per person to its lowest since 2013-14. By 2027-28, RHDI per person recovers its 2021-22 level, but remains over 1 per cent below pre-pandemic levels.` [link](https://obr.uk/docs/dlm_uploads/CCS0822661240-002_CCS001_SECURE_OBR_EFO_November_2022_BOOKMARK.pdf)
    
- On 17 November 2022, The Institute for Fiscal Studies released a response to the Autumn Statement which said:
    
    - `As expected, the new Chancellor had to contend with a much worse economic and fiscal outlook than forecast back in March. For 2025-26, weak growth and high inflation led to receipts being revised down by £25 billion and spending on benefits and state pensions being revised up by £14 billion. Even more strikingly, the upwards revision to the Office for Budget Responsibility’s assumed parth for interest rates led to forecast spending on debt interest in that year being doubled from £47 billion to £95 billion. On top of this, policy announcements since March - in particular the decision not to introduce the health and social care levy - added around another £16 billion to borrowing in that year. Overall, before incorporating the measures from today’s Autumn Statement, the increase in borrowing amounted to around £90 billion in 2026-27. A lot has certainly changed since March.` [link](https://ifs.org.uk/articles/autumn-statement-2022-response)
    
    - `Living standards growth since 2008 has been extremely weak by historical standards. Unsurprisingly given the cost of living crisis, today’s Office for Budget Responsibility forecast suggests that this is going from bad to worse. This year we are set to see the largest fall in real household disposable income per head (4.3%) since the late 1940s; next year, we are set to see the second-largest fall (2.8%). Modest growth is expected to return after that, but even by 2027-28 we are not expected to have had a single year of growth higher than the pre-2008 average since 2015-16. Average household income per head is due to be the same in 2027-28 as it was in 2018-19, and 31% below where it would have been if the pre-2008 trend had continued.` [link](https://ifs.org.uk/articles/autumn-statement-2022-response)
    
- On 17 November 2022, The National Institute of Economic and Social Research released a response to the Autumn Statement which said:
    
    - `The series of unfortunate events that caused a turmoil in the financial markets and public finances has left the Chancellor rushing to unleash a fiscal contraction to fulfil arbitrary fiscal targets amidst the headwinds the economy is facing. Given the current economic climate of persistent high inflation and sluggish growth, the changes made to the fiscal targets are a step in the right direction as they enabled him to provide at least some support to households this year.` [link](https://www.niesr.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2022-NIESRs-Autumn-Statement-Response-FINAL.pdf)
    
    - `Today, the Chancellor has announced an effective tax rise for all working people by freezing thresholds on personal incomes taxes. Given that the latest ONS data indicates that real wages fell by 2.6 per cent on the year, we had hoped the Chancellor would not implement this policy in the lower thresholds – as it will further squeeze budgets that are already at capacity due to the cost-of-living crisis. That being said, the lowering of the top rate of income tax threshold to £125,140 as well as decreases to the capital gains and dividend tax reliefs are suitable measures since affected households are in a much better place to cope with surging prices. While we appreciate the Chancellor’s mention that his increases to windfall taxes are temporary, we wonder whether the extension of what was once a one-off policy will set an unhelpful precedent for future Chancellors looking to fill self-dug ‘fiscal holes’.` [link](https://www.niesr.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2022-NIESRs-Autumn-Statement-Response-FINAL.pdf)
    
    - `The Chancellor has announced several spending changes, retaining some of the government’s previous spending commitments and plans on infrastructure investment. Maintaining the levels of public investment in the short term is a step in the right direction, but public investment spending could and should be increased, especially in the long term, where the announced freeze translates into a cut in real terms.` [link](https://www.niesr.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2022-NIESRs-Autumn-Statement-Response-FINAL.pdf)
    
- On 18 November 2022, The Resolution Foundation released a report as response to the Autumn Statement which said:
    
    - `A key determinant of tax revenues over the medium term is the rate at which the economy can grow without generating inflation. The OBR has downgraded its estimate of growth in potential supply between 2021 and 2026 by 1.4 percentage points to 11.8 per cent. But they remain notably more optimistic than the Bank of England.  
    -   
    - The OBR's optimism is also clear in comparison to the UK's recent past. They are expecting potential GDP to grow faster over the next 5 years (1.7 per cent at an annualised rate) than the average growth rate of actual GDP over the 12 years leading up to the pandemic (1.2 per cent) (see Figure 6). Growth in population and productivity are the main drivers of potential supply in the long term. The OBR is expecting population growth to decelerate to 0.6 per cent per year, albeit somewhat faster than their expectation in March 2022, while it is expecting annualised productivity growth to accelerate markedly from 0.4 (2007 to 2019) to 1.0 per cent (in 2027).`

    - `One of the most persistent economic impacts of Covid-19 has been the hit to labour supply, with participation still down by 396,000 as of September 2022 compared to February 2020. This has largely come from lower participation among older workers, with signs of earlier retirements and a rise in ill-health among this group. The OBR have now factored persistently lower labour supply into their forecasts: it thinks that the 16+ participation rate will remain at 63 per cent (roughly a percentage point lower than the 2019 level), slightly lower than expected in March.` [link](https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/app/uploads/2022/11/Help-today-squeeze-tomorrow.pdf)
    
    - `Yesterday, Jeremy Hunt delivered an Autumn Statement that combined the ‘tough choices’ rhetoric of George Osborne and the policies of Gordon Brown. In the face of grim economic – and grimmer fiscal – forecasts, he announced energy support today but tougher times tomorrow, with huge stealth tax rises for the middle and top followed by far less concrete spending cuts pencilled in for after the next election.  
    -   
    - These decisions were made in the light of the fact that, as an energy importer during an energy price shock, Britain is getting poorer. Deciding exactly how that blow should be shared out between different households, as well as between current and future taxpayers was, to a significant extent, the task facing the Chancellor. He has decided that households will do so with higher energy bills, higher taxes, and worse public services than previously expected. Whether or not making the choices was tough, the reality of living through the next few years will be.`

- On 25 November 2022, The Institute for Government released a report as response to the Autumn Statement which said:
    
    - `Did the statement deliver enough funds to maintain standards and address backlogs over the rest of this parliament?  
    -   
    - The chancellor said that the Conservatives wouldn’t “leave our debts to the next generation”. While that may or may not be true, it is certainly the case that this government has largely left its fiscal consolidation to the next parliament. Hunt provided some additional funding in the next two years for schools, the NHS and social care, but £22 billion of cuts across all day-to-day spending have been pencilled in for 2025/26 to 2027/28 – after the next general election, which will be in January 2025 at the latest.  
    -   
    - After the autumn statement, the overall settlement for day-to-day departmental spending across the current spending review period (2022/23 to 2024/25), accounting for the changing inflation forecast, looks broadly comparable to the original announcement in October 2021, which many commentators described as generous.`  
    - [link](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/sites/default/files/publications/autumn-statement-2022-public-services.pdf)
    
    - If Hunt’s 2025/26 plans were announced at a spending review in 2025, they would be less generous than every spending review announcement since 2002 – with the telling exceptions of 2010 and 2015, delivered as part of George Osborne’s austerity programme. Osborne’s 2015 plans proved undeliverable, with the government later finding it necessary to provide emergency funding to social care, the NHS and criminal justice in response to poor performance. Given that public services are now performing much worse than in 2015, it is likely that the next government will face major political pressure to spend more than planned in this autumn statement.` [link](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/sites/default/files/publications/autumn-statement-2022-public-services.pdf)
