    > `The department said it has already provided "upwards of 55,000 documents, 24 personal witness statements, eight corporate statements" and that "extensive time and effort" had gone into assisting the inquiry over the last 11 months.  
    >   
    > But it added: "However, we are firmly of the view that the inquiry does not have the power to request unambiguously irrelevant information that is beyond the scope of this investigation.  
    >   
    > "This includes the WhatsApp messages of government employees' which are not about work but instead are entirely personal and relate to their private lives."  
    >   
    > The latest intervention suggests the government could be willing to go to court to avoid handing over the material requested by the inquiry chair, Lady Hallett, who had ordered the department to hand over the former prime minister's messages - alongside diary entries and notes - by 4pm on Tuesday 30 May.`

    > Despite the development, it said it would "continue to co-operate fully with the inquiry before, during and after the jurisdictional issue in question".  
    >

    >   
    > The Cabinet Office said there are "important principles at stake" - such as the issue of privacy.
