### 5 July
- Rishi Sunak resigned as chancellor. Rishi Sunak’s Letter:
    
    - `That is why I have always tried to compromise in order to deliver the things you want to achieve. On those occasions where I disagreed with you privately, I have supported you publicly.  
    -   
    - That is the nature of the collective government upon which our system relies and it is particularly important that the Prime Minister and Chancellor remain united in hard times such as those we are experiencing today.  
    -   
    - Our country is facing immense challenges. We both want a low-tax, high-growth economy, and world class public services, but this can only be responsibly delivered if we are prepared to work hard, make sacrifices and take difficult decisions.  
    -   
    - I firmly believe the public are ready to hear that truth. Our people know that if something is too good to be true then it’s not true. They need to know that whilst there is a path to a better future, it is not an easy one.  
    -   
    - In preparation for our proposed joint speech on the economy next week, it has become clear to me that our approaches are fundamentally too different.  
    -   
    - I am sad to be leaving Government but I have reluctantly come to the conclusion that we cannot continue like this.`

- Sajid Javid also resigned as Health Secretary. Sajid Javid’s Letter:
    
    - `Conservatives at their best are seen as hard-headed decision-makers, guided by strong values. We may not have always been popular, but we have been competent in acting in the national interest.  
    -   
    - Sadly, in the current circumstances, the public are concluding that we are now neither. The vote of confidence last month showed that a large number of our colleagues agree. It was a moment for humility, grip and new direction.  
    -   
    - I regret to say, however, that it is clear to me that this situation will not change under your leadership – and you have therefore lost my confidence too.`  
    -   
    - ...  
    -   
    - `These are commendable legacies in unprecedented times. But the country needs a strong and principled Conservative Party, and the Party is bigger than any one individual.  
    -   
    - I served you loyally and as a friend, but we all serve the country first. When made to choose between those loyalties there can only be one answer.`

- Bim Afolami also resigned as The Conservative Party’s vice chairman for youth live on air. Bim Afolami’s Comments:
    
    - `I just don’t think the prime minister any longer has, not just my support, but he doesn’t have, I don’t think, the support of the party, or indeed the country any more`  
    -   
    - ...  
    -   
    - `I think you have to resign because I can’t serve under the prime minister – but I say that with regret because I think this government has done some great things.`  
    - [[bimaf]]
    
- Alex Chalk also resigned as Solicitor General. Alex Chalk’s Letter:
    
    - `With great sadness I am resigning as Solicitor General.  
    -   
    - To be in government is to accept the duty to argue for difficult or even unpopular policy positions where that serves the broader national interest. But it cannot extend to defending the indefensible.  
    -   
    - The cumulative effect of the Owen Paterson debacle, Partygate and now the handling of the former Deputy Chief Whip’s resignation, is that public confidence in the ability of Number 10 to uphold the standards of candour expected of a British Government has irretrievably broken down. I regret that I share that judgement. This comes at a moment of intense challenge for our country, when trust in government can rarely have been more important. I’m afraid the time has therefore come for fresh leadership.`

- Steve Barclay replaces Sajid Javid, Nadhim Zahawi replaces Rishi Sunak and Michelle Donelan replaces Nadhim Zahawi as Education Minister. [link](https://news.sky.com/story/nadhim-zahawi-made-chancellor-after-rishi-sunak-resigns-as-steve-barclay-replaces-sajid-javid-as-health-secretary-12646552)
### 6 July
- Will Quince also resigned as Minister for Children and Families. Will Quince’s Letter:
    
    - `Thank you for meeting with me yesterday evening and for your sincere apology regarding the briefings I received from No 10 ahead of Monday's media round, which we now know to be inaccurate.  
    -   
    - It is with great sadness and regret that I feel that I have no choice but to tender my resignation as Minister for Children and Families as I accepted and repeated those assurances in good faith.`  
    - [link](https://twitter.com/willquince/status/1544583312353673217/photo/1)
    
- Robin Walker also resigned as Minister of State for School Standards. Robin Walker’s Letter:
    
    - `Unfortunately, recent events have made it clear to me that our great party, for which I have campaigned all of my adult life, has become distracted from its core missions by a relentless focus on questions over leadership. The loss of the Rishi Sunak and the Sajid Javid this week, two of our brightest talents from the top team, reflects a worrying narrowing of the broad church that I believe any Conservative Government should seek to achieve.  
    -   
    - I know that you have been an instinctive One Nation Conservative and I have been proud to support you on delivering Brexit with a deal, on supporting our precious union and on the monumental effort to support the lives and livelihoods of so many through the pandemic. Sadly, in recent months those great achievements of your Government have become overshadowed by mistakes and questions about integrity.`

- Victoria Atkins also resigned as Minister of State at the Ministry of Justice. Victoria Atkins’s Letter:
    
    - `Values such as integrity, decency, respect and professionalism should matter to us all. I have watched with growing concern as those values have fractured under your Patterson, Partygate and Pincher. I have given you the benefit of the doubt at each turn, out of loyalty to you as Prime Minister and to our great Party.  
    -   
    - The events of this week, however, have made these contortions impossible. The casual mistreatment of Minister Will Quince and the revelations contained in Lord McDonald's letter highlight just how far your government has fallen from these ideals. I can no longer pirouette around our fractured values. We can and must be better than this.`

- Stuart Andrew also resigned Ministry of Housing. Stuart Andrew’s Letter:
    
    - `Loyalty and unity are traits that I have always endeavoured to provide for our great party. However, I fear I have let these override my judgement recently. There comes a time when you have to look at your own personal integrity and that time is now. Therefore, given recent events I have no other choice than to resign.  
    -   
    - Our party, particularly our members and more importantly our great country, deserve better. Having a marginal seat I have seen the huge sacrifice our members make in volunteering considerable hours to campaign on our behalf and I cannot, in all good conscience, tolerate them having to defend the indefensible.`

- Kemi Badenoch also resigned as Levelling up Minister. Neil O'Brien also resigned as Levelling up Minister. Alex Burghart also resigned as Education Minister. Lee Rowley also resigned as Business Minister. Julia Lopez also resigned as Culture Minister. Kemi Badenock, Neil O’Brien, Alex Burghart, Lee Rowley and Julia Lopez’s Letter:
    
    - `It is with great regret that we are resigning as members of the Government. It has been an honour to serve in your administration and we remain extremely grateful for the opportunity you have given us to serve our country.  
    -   
    - You have had the most difficult task in a generation. We hugely admire your fortitude, stamina and enduring optimism. You can be rightly proud of the significant decisions which you have, by common acclamation, got right.  
    -   
    - However, it has become increasingly clear that the Government cannot function given the issues that have come to light and the way in which they have been handled. In good faith, we must ask that, for the good of the Party and the country, you step aside.`  
    - [link](https://twitter.com/KemiBadenoch/status/1544673839363268616/photo/1)
    
- Rachel Maclean also resigned as Home Office Minister. Rachel Maclean’s Letter:
    
    - `It is with great regret that I am resigning from your Government.  
    -   
    - When you appointed me to serve in the Home Office, you tasked me - as Minister for Safeguarding - with improving the woefully low rate of prosecutions for sexual offences.  
    -   
    - However, I have regretfully concluded that recent events demonstrate that while you remain ss with this vitally important task.  
    -   
    - The victims of sexual harassment I work with tell me that every single time the biggest obstacle they face in coming forward to tell their heartbreaking and traumatic stories is that they fear they will not be believed, or that the system will cover up for the perpetrator.  
    -   
    - These crimes are almost always about power, because individuals know that the power they have over their victims means they will be protected and can act with impunity.  
    -   
    - I have defended you to the hilt to my constituents and to the public. You have been an incredible leader of our party through some very difficult times but you must now resign for the good of the country and our party.  
    -   
    - Values, principles, integrity and decency matter more than anything and I cannot continue to stand by and do nothing. I ask you now to step aside so that we can get on with the important task of serving the country and providing it with the leadership it so badly needs.`

- Johnson also sacked Michael Gove after he urges him to resign.
    
    - `A No 10 source said: "You can't have a snake who is not with you on any of the big arguments who then gleefully tells the press the leader has to go." The PM rang Mr Gove on Wednesday evening to tell him he was sacked.  
    -   
    - ...  
    -   
    - He told senior MPs on the Commons Liaison Committee it would not be right for him to "walk away" amid economic pressures and the war in Ukraine. And a No 10 source rejected speculation Mr Johnson would announce his resignation in Downing Street on Wednesday, saying the "PM fights on".`

- Simon Hart also resigned as Secretary of State for Wales. Simon Hart’s Letter:
    
    - `I had desperately hoped that I could avoid writing this letter, but alas there seems no other option left but to step down from my role as Secretary of State for Wales.  
    -   
    - You will be remembered as a Prime Minister with energy, vision, determination and humour. There was never a dull moment as a Minister in your Government, and I will be forever grateful to have been given the chance to be part of it.  
    -   
    - I have never been a massive fan of Ministerial resignations being the best means of forcing change. Colleagues have done their upmost in private and public to help you turn the ship around, but it is with sadness that I feel we have passed the point where this is possible.`

### 7 July
- Brandon Lewis also resigned as Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. Brandon Lewis’s Letter:
    
    - `I have given you, and those around you, the benefit of the doubt. I have gone out and defended this Government both publicly and privately. We are, however, now past the point of no return. I cannot sacrifice my personal integrity to defend things as they stand now. It is clear that our Party, parliamentary colleagues, volunteers and the whole country, deserve better.  
    -   
    - I delivered my first campaign leaflet as a teenager and the Conservative Party has been hugely influential in my life ever since. In recent weeks and months, we have been relentlessly on the defensive, consumed by introspection and in-fighting. A divided Party cannot win elections. It cannot deliver for those who trusted us with their votes for the first time in 2019.  
    -   
    - A decent and responsible Government relies on honesty, integrity and mutual respect - it is a matter of profound personal regret for me that I must leave Government as I no longer believe those values are being upheld.`  
    - [link](https://twitter.com/BrandonLewis/status/1544921034368901122/photo/1)
    
- Helen Whately also resigned as Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. Helen Whately’s Letter:
    
    - `Your vision for our country and your mission to level-up has inspired and galvanised people. As Exchequer Secretary I have seen this in practice and been proud to play a part. I have argued that you should continue as Prime Minister many times in recent months, but there are only so many times you can apologise and move on. That point has been reached.  
    -   
    - ...  
    -   
    - I will continue to serve my constituents of Faversham and Mid Kent from the backbenches to the very best of my abilities.`

- Damian Hinds also resigned as Security Minister. Damian Hinds Letter:
    
    - `As Prime Minister you have great achievements to your name, not least your leadership in delivering our world-leading vaccination programme, and our support to the people of Ukraine in the face of Putin’s brutality. But more important than any government or leader are the standards we uphold in public life and faith in our democracy and public administration. Because of the serious erosion in these, I have come to the conclusion that the right thing for our country and for our party is for you to stand down as party leader and Prime Minister. I had hoped you would take this course sooner, of your own volition. But as it has become clear that you still intend to stay, I cannot continue to serve in your administration.` [link](https://twitter.com/DamianHinds/status/1544928142854340608/photo/1)
    
- George Freeman also resigned as Science Minister. George Freeman’s Letter:
    
    - `I do this with a very heavy heart. Our country is facing a series of crises and needs strong leadership, and needs Ministers focused on delivering strong and effective government to deliver the priorities for which we won a massive majority only 30 months ago. I backed you then and since because of your commitment to make Brexit an inspiring moment of national renewal - of our economy, Parliamentary sovereignty and our place in the world - in the One Nation Conservative tradition on which you stood.  
    -   
    - As you know I believe very deeply that our science, research, technology, and innovation sector is KEY to unlocking sustainable growth, levelling up and strengthening the UK’s role in the world as a Science & Technology superpower tackling global challenges. For the last six months I have tried to put my responsibilities as Minister of the Crown to this vital mission first and give you the benefit of the doubt over the media storm over “Partygate”.  
    -   
    - But I’m afraid the culmination of your lack of transparency and candour with Parliament (and willingness to ask your Ministers to mislead Parliament), your removal of key pillars of the Ministerial code, your handling of your appointment of a Deputy Chief Whip who it turns out you knew had a history of sexual abuse allegations, is too much. This is seriously damaging public trust and respect for government, democracy and the law, and this great Party’s long tradition as the party of standards, character, conduct, integrity and duty to office and country before partisan self-interest.`

- Guy Opperman also resigned as Pensions Minister. Guy Opperman’s Letter:
    
    - `My view is that it is important to work as a team and deliver on the priorities that matter most to my constituents in Northumberland. As a Minister, I accept and understand the requirement of collective ministerial agreement upon which our system relies. The record of this government, as we have faced the challenges of the Covid pandemic, the war in Ukraine and the consequential impact on the cost of living and inflation is something I am immensely proud to have been a part of. I have backed you throughout these challenges.  
    -   
    - We both know I was particularly upset at the behaviour of the Number Ten team during the Covid restrictions. I backed you in January 2022 because I wanted to see a real change in approach in Number Ten. I have given you ample opportunity to show real change. Sadly, recent events have shown clearly that Government simply cannot function with you in charge. In good faith, and with regret, for the good of the country, I must ask you to stand down. No one individual, however successful in the past, is bigger than the party, or this great country.`

- Chris Philp also resigned as Minister for Tech and the Digital Economy. Chris Philp’s Letter:
    
    - `Important though all these things are, so are integrity, honesty and trust in politics. Given events over the past few weeks and months I therefore think that you should resign as Prime Minister and it follows that I cannot serve in your Government any longer.  
    -   
    - I will continue to work hard in the national interest and for residents Croydon South from the backbenches.`  
    - [link](https://twitter.com/CPhilpOfficial/status/1544939888931635200/photo/1)
    
- James Cartlidge also resigned as Minister for Tech and the Digital Economy. James Cartlidge’s Letter:
    
    - `I felt duty bound to remain in post given the very challenging circumstances facing the criminal courts. I took the view there had to be some semblance of Government in this crucial arm of our constitution. But the position is clearly untenable.  
    -   
    - ...  
    -   
    - The judicial part of our constitution is precious, embodying the principle of the rule of law that is so sacrosanct. It was difficult to put aside previous transgressions, but you have been a lion in Ukraine and deserved a chance, with your democratic mandate, to change and reset.  
    -   
    - It must now be obvious that this is no longer even remotely possible.`

- The newly promoted Nadhim Zahawi release a letter asking Johnson to resign. Nadhim Zahawi’s Letter:
    
    - `Yesterday, I made clear to the Prime Minister alongside my colleagues in Nol0 that there was only one direction where this was going, and that he should leave with dignity. Out of respect, and in the hopes that he would listen to an old friend of 30 years, I kept this counsel private.  
    -   
    - I am heartbroken that he hasn’t listened and that he is now undermining the incredible achievements of this Government at this late hour. No one will forget getting Brexit done, keeping a dangerous antisemite out of No10, our handling of covid and our support for Ukraine in its hour of need.  
    -   
    - But the country deserves a Government that is not only stable, but which acts with integrity.  
    -   
    - Prime Minister, you know in your heart what the right thing to do is, and go now.`  
    - [link](https://twitter.com/nadhimzahawi/status/1544950219657330688/photo/1)
    
- Michelle Donelan also resigned as Education Secretary just 36 hours after being appointed replacing Nadhim Zahawi. Michelle Donelan’s Letter
    
    - `In life we must always do what we believe is right. Above all I am here to serve the British public. I see no way that you can continue in post, but without a formal mechanism to remove you it seems that the only way that this is only possible is for those of us who remain in Cabinet to force your hand.  
    -   
    - You have put us in an impossible situation. I am deeply saddened that it has come to this. but as someone who values integrity above all else, I have no choice.  
    -   
    - I will continue to champion opportunity for our brilliantly talented and inspiring young people from the backbenches.`

- Caroline Johnson also resigned as Vice Chair of the Conservative Party. Caroline Johnson’s Letter:
    
    - `It is with great sadness, however, that I recognise that over time the cumulative effect of your errors of judgement and domestic actions have squandered the goodwill of our great Party, Conservative colleagues, and many of my constituents.  
    -   
    - Thank you for the opportunity to serve and for all the positive achievements that have come with your leadership of the last three years. It is important now that you make a dignified exit so that you will still be remembered for your successes. I believe that attempting to stay when the writing is on the wall can only damage our Party and therefore our country.`

- Luke Hall also resigned as Deputy Chair of the Conservative Party. Luke Halls’ Letter:
    
    - `I had taken the view that there must be parliamentary oversight of the inevitable leadership contest. However, there are others who can provide that. The current situation is clearly untenable.  
    -   
    - I have spent many years supporting the Conservative Party at every level, but that loyalty is directed to the party, our values, and ultimately the communities we represent, not any one individual. It is now in the best interest of the Conservative Party and the country for you to step down.  
    -   
    - I am deeply saddened that it has come to this, but like many other colleagues, I feel there is no choice.`

- Rebecca Pow also resigned as Environment Minister. Rebecca Pow’ Letter:
    
    - `However, too much has changed, and the Party and the good of the country has to come first and I fear under your leadership it has veered too far off course.  
    -   
    - I waited until this moment partly because I am actually at home suffering from Coved and partly because I thought you would do the right thing and step aside for the good of the Party and the Country; but this has not transpired and now is time for me with great sadness to step down from the role that is in essence my life's dream, the culmination of my life’s experiences, and where I believe was making a difference for all of our futures.`
