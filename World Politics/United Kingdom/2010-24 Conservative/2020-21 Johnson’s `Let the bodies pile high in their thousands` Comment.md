- Johnson is alleged to have said it on 30 October 2020, one day before the announcement of the second national lockdown.
    
    - `The accounts of what happened on the evening of October 30, 2020 could not be further apart – but on one matter there is unanimity. Boris Johnson was in a foul mood on a day he now wishes he could forget. Having publicly pledged to do everything he could to avoid the "disaster" of a second lockdown, the Prime Minister had been strong-armed by his most senior ministers and aides into agreeing to just that. Mr Johnson feared he would pay a heavy price politically for a decision that would hit the economy and rile Tory MPs and the public at large. He was wrong.` [link](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2021/04/26/let-bodies-pile-high-really-happened-night-boris-johnson-accused/)
    
- Sources told the BBC and Robert Peston of ITV News that the remark was made. According to Peston, the remarks were heard by a number of people. Johnson denied having made the remark, describing it as total rubbish.
    
    - `There is an incredible amount of hysteria and noise being generated by the conflict between Boris Johnson and his former chief aide, Dominic Cummings. So maybe it is useful for me to share what I know about three big claims:  
    -   
    - 1) The charge that Prime Minister did say he would rather see 'bodies pile high in their thousands' than order a third lockdown (as reported in the Daily Mail); 2) The cabinet secretary Simon Case still believes Cummings may be the 'Chatty Rat' who leaked details about November's lockdown; 3) the refurbishment of the Prime Minister's flat was originally to be funded by Tory party donors, even though on Friday the Prime Minister said he had been paying for it.`
