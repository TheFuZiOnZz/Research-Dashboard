    - `Figure 8 compares the results of this analysis to the previous projections, which include the increased generosity. It clearly shows the significant reduction in the increase in poverty that has resulted from the increase in generosity of these benefits. In each Winter 2020 scenario, these choices have insulated more than 600,000 people from poverty. For the high unemployment, high furlough scenario in Winter 2020, some 690,000 fewer people are in poverty as a result of the changes introduced to benefits and have been protected at a time of crisis` [link](https://li.com/reports/poverty-during-the-covid-19-crisis/)

Families with children will be disproportionately impacted and worryingly, 6 in 10 of all single-parent families in the UK will be impacted.` [link](https://www.jrf.org.uk/universal-credit-cut-impact-constituency)
    
- A 2021 DWP report found that:
    
    - `The employment rate has increased for all people on Universal Credit to 40% (2.3 million) on 10 June 2021 from 36% (2.0 million) on 11 June 2020. The increase in the employment rate, and that it is higher than the rate before the coronavirus pandemic, should not be interpreted as more employment. It should be considered in the context of the policy changes to Universal Credit to support people through the coronavirus pandemic.` [link](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/universal-credit-statistics-29-april-2013-to-8-july-2021/universal-credit-statistics-29-april-2013-to-8-july-2021\#people-on-uc-header)
