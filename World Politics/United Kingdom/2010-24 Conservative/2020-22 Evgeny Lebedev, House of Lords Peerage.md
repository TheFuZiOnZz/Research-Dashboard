### 2020-22 Evgeny Lebedev, House of Lords Peerage
- Evgeny Alexandrovich Lebedev, born 8 May 1980, is a Russian-British businessman, who owns Lebedev Holdings Ltd, which in turn owns the Evening Standard, The Independent and the TV channel London Live. He derives his wealth from his father, Alexander Lebedev, a Russian oligarch and former KGB officer who was put on Canada's sanctions list following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.
- In 31 July 2020, Lebedev was nominated for a life peerage by Boris Johnson for philanthropy and services to the media, a move that drew criticism.
    
    > `Dear Mr Lebedev,  
    >   
    > Congratulations on your peerage! I am writing to set out the next steps in the process for you.  
    >   
    > Now that the announcement has been made you need to contact the Garter Principal King of Arms, Thomas Woodcock. He is aware that you will be getting in contact and will work with you to agree your title. You can contact Mr Woodcock at  
    >   
    > Once your title is agreed, Garter will arrange for your Letters Patent to be drawn up and from that date you will become a peer. On that day or any day thereafter you will be introduced to the House of Lords, at which point you will be able to participate in proceedings.  
    >   
    > Please do not hesitate to get in touch if you have any questions and congratulations once again on your elevation to the House of Lords.`

- On 5 March 2022, The Sunday Times released an article which alleged that British security services warned that granting Lebedev a peerage posed a national security risk, but Johnson went ahead with it despite the security service assessment. There were reports of trips and secret trips with Lebedev using a private jet without officials present.
    
    > `The security services withdrew an assessment that granting a peerage to a Russian businessman posed a national security risk after Boris Johnson intervened. The prime minister pushed ahead with the nomination of his friend Evgeny Lebedev, the Moscow-born son of an ex-KGB agent and media mogul, even after intelligence officials raised concerns. Johnson is said to have responded to advice to drop it by claiming: “This is anti-Russianism.” In March 2020, the House of Lords Appointments Commission (Holac), which vets peerages, wrote to the prime minister advising him against granting Lebedev, 41, a lifetime seat in the Lords.` [link](https://archive.ph/kQesM)
    
    > `The prime minister returned to Downing Street and took a personal interest in the case. A former adviser said he refused to accept the verdict of the security services and would not drop the issue. One source said Johnson’s political aides had helped to unblock sensitive peerages to which Holac had objected at around the same time — such as Lord Cruddas of Shoreditch, the former Conservative Party co-treasurer — as they were deemed to be of wider importance to the party. While they were “pretty disinterested” by Lebedev’s case, Johnson was insistent his peerage “go through”. By June, Holac received an update about Lebedev. Cabinet Office officials advised that the security services no longer deemed his peerage to be problematic. The source said: “The security services withdrew that particular quite damning bit of advice.”` [link](https://archive.ph/kQesM)
    
    > `A source said the strongly held suspicion was that Johnson had asked the security services whether “perhaps their advice could be watered down”. A second source, a former Downing Street aide, confirmed there had been a change in the security assessment, but they, like other senior officials at the time, did not know the exact circumstances leading up to it. A third source, who also worked in No 10, said they believed a “secret deal” had been done with security officials at the prime minister’s behest.` [link](https://archive.ph/kQesM)
    
    > `He is thought to have travelled to the castle at least six times, sometimes in Lebedev’s private jet. Even after being appointed foreign secretary in 2016, he continued to go, making at least one secret trip. He did so without his Metropolitan Police protection officers, tasked with giving him 24/7 protection. It means Johnson, as Britain’s top diplomat, spent time in the home of Russian oligarch without any security or officials present.` [link](https://archive.ph/kQesM)
    
- On 7 March 2022, Boris Johnson said that The Sunday Times article was "simply incorrect.”
    
    > `Mr Johnson told reporters that the article was "simply incorrect".` [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-60650515)
    
- On 11 March 2022, Lebedev relesed a statement saying that he is `not a security risk` and his family `has a record of standing up for press freedom` in the UK and Russia.
    
    > `But I am not a security risk to this country, which I love. My father a long time ago was a foreign intelligence agent of the KGB, but I am not some agent of Russia. The editorial coverage in the Evening Standard and The Independent, of which I am also a shareholder, of Russia and its activities over the time of my involvement in those titles makes that clear. There can be no question of the editorial independence and excellence of both the titles in their coverage of this war.  
    >   
    > In recent years my father has also spent his time campaigning against corruption and illegal financial dealings which has sought to expose the network of inappropriate financial dealings occurring globally, not least in his recent book ‘Hunt The Banker’.  
    >   
    > My family has a record of standing up for press freedom in not only the United Kingdom but also in Russia. We are long-term supporters of Novaya Gazeta, the only surviving independent newspaper in Russia which we are honoured to have supported alongside the staff and our friend, the former leader of the Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev.`

- On 6 July 2022, in a session of the Liaison Committee, Johnson confirms that he met Russian oligarch Lebedev in the past as Foreign Secretary without aides.`
    
    > `Dame Diana Johnson: My final question. Could you confirm—I would appreciate a yes or a no—that you met former KGB officer Alexander Lebedev without officials when you were Foreign Secretary on 28 April 2018?  
    >   
    > The Prime Minister: I would have to check.  
    >   
    > Dame Diana Johnson: Are you having a lapse of memory again?  
    >   
    > The Prime Minister: No. You are asking me a very specific question about a very specific date. I would have to get back to you. I certainly have met the gentleman in question—  
    >   
    > Dame Diana Johnson: Without officials?  
    >   
    > The Prime Minister: He was the proprietor of the London Evening Standard when I was Mayor of London. I am certainly not going to deny having met Alexander Lebedev. I certainly have. As far as I remember, he used to own the London Evening Standard.  
    >   
    > Dame Diana Johnson: Yes, but with officials when you were Foreign Secretary. Did you meet him with officials or without?  
    >   
    > The Prime Minister: Look, I have certainly met him without officials. As I say, he is a proprietor of a newspaper.  
    >   
    > Chair: Perhaps you could write to us with a specific answer to that very specific question.  
    >   
    > The Prime Minister: Very happy to.  
    >   
    > Dame Meg Hillier: Can I just follow that up, Prime Minister? You said you met him without officials. Presumably that was when you were Mayor of London. When you were Foreign Secretary, did you meet Alexander Lebedev without officials?  
    >   
    > The Prime Minister: I think I probably did, but—  
    >   
    > Dame Meg Hillier: Probably did?  
    >   
    > The Prime Minister: As I say, I would need to check.  
    >   
    > Dame Meg Hillier: You are used to regularly meeting him? “Probably” because you meet him often or “probably” because you can’t remember?  
    >   
    > The Prime Minister: I have met him on a very few occasions—  
    >   
    > Dame Meg Hillier: As Foreign Secretary?  
    >   
    > The Prime Minister: On the occasion you mention, if that was when I was Foreign Secretary, then yes.  
    >   
    > Dame Meg Hillier: Without officials?  
    >   
    > The Prime Minister: Yes. That makes sense, yes.  
    >   
    > Dame Meg Hillier: Did you report to your officials that you had met him?  
    >   
    > The Prime Minister: I think I did mention it, yes.  
    >   
    > Chair: And where did you meet him?  
    >   
    > The Prime Minister: I met him in Italy, as it happens, but I really, you know—  
    >   
    > Chair: Perhaps you will write to us.  
    >   
    > Dame Meg Hillier: Was it a personal engagement?`

    >   
    > He did attend the Lords slightly later than this, being formally recorded there on 19 May 2022, but without speaking or voting.
