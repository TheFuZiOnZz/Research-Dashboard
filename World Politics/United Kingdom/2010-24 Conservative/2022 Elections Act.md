- On 13 December 2021, A House of Commons Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee Report on the Elections Bill had a section called `Concerns regarding the impact of introducing mandatory voter ID` which included that:
    
    - `Professor James highlighted that in the first election following the introduction of a photographic voter ID requirement in Northern Ireland, it is estimated that 25,000 voters, about 2.3% of the electorate, did not vote as a result. He said he thought the 2.3% figure was a reasonable expectation for the number of people who would not vote at elections following the introduction of voter ID. To extrapolate this data and apply it to a UK general election would mean that approximately 1.1 million people would not vote in such an election as a result of the introduction of a mandatory voter ID requirement, and as the Government’s own research indicates, this would not fall evenly across the population. Professor James also pointed out that while it is often said that things are working well in Northern Ireland, “there has not been a detailed systematic evaluation of the situation since the initial introduction of photographic ID”.` [link](https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/8194/documents/83775/default/)

    - - 7 September 2021: `Rachel Hopkins: First to Professor James and then Jess Garland and any others who want to come in. Other minority groups have expressed concerns to us regarding potential disenfranchisement and prevention of being able to vote. What level of disenfranchisement is likely with the Government’s proposals in this Bill across a range of groups?  
    - -   
    - - Professor James: That is a great question. The terminology “disenfranchisement” is often used. I think it is clear from the case of Northern Ireland that 2.3% of the population had additional things they had to do to go and cast their ballot, which meant that they did not take part in that election. Scaled up for a UK parliamentary election, that is something in the order of 1.1 million people. As we have heard already, the Government’s own research points to how it does not fall evenly across the population. We have already heard about the elderly. The Government’s own research points to unemployed citizens, those with severe disability and those without qualifications being less likely to have identification. I think that trans and gender non-conforming individuals is a particularly vulnerable group in this process and the Government’s research is that they are much less likely to have a form of ID. There are multiple groups that could be adversely affected, but broadly speaking 2.3% sounds like a reasonable expectation.  
    - -   
    - - Dr Garland: There are the groups that Toby mentioned and the Electoral Commission research backs that up. It is people who are unemployed, people who are renting from their council, people who have a disability who are more likely not to have the ID. We also know from the Government’s research that 42% of those people who don’t have ID say they would not apply for the free elector card, so that is clearly not going to solve the problems here. It is not just whether people have ID. Other people have said it is whether this has a chilling effect. People who are already hesitant to take part in the system might feel like this is just one step too far and might not feel welcome and that is a real concern. I want to pick up on the point from the Government research about 2% of people not having any form of ID. That includes unrecognisable ID, if you just have that is out of date and unrecognisable ID is allowed. If you say ID has to be recognisable that increases to 4% of people don’t have the right ID, which is a huge number of people across the population. I think a legitimate question right now is are we saying the scheme includes unrecognisable photos as well and just picking up on the point made earlier about the pressure put on staff in the polling stations.`

    - `Age UK raised concerns that a voter ID requirement would cause particular difficulties for older people. Angela Kitching, Head of External Affairs at Age UK highlighted that the Government’s own research found that 6% of people over 70 years old would have problems presenting the right kind of ID. Added to this, she said Age UK had concerns  
    - that the Government’s research had excluded 500,000 people in situational care homes and sheltered accommodation. She went on to tell us:  
    -   
    - These are not marginal figures. They are really significant numbers of older people and, to be honest, it is already not particularly easy for a lot of older people to get out to vote.`  
    
- On 21 February 2022, the Electoral Commission, While the bill was still being passed, wrote to government ministers urging for the independence of the commission to be retained.
    
    - `It is our firm and shared view that the introduction of a Strategy and Policy Statement – enabling the Government to guide the work of the Commission – is inconsistent with the role that an independent electoral commission plays in a healthy democracy. This independence is fundamental to maintaining confidence and legitimacy in our electoral system.`
    
    - `The Statement has no precedent in the accountability arrangements of electoral commissions in other comparable democracies, such as Canada, Australia or New Zealand. Indeed, the Code of Good Practice in Electoral Matters of the Venice Commission, of which the UK is a member, states that “Only transparency, impartiality and independence from political motivated manipulation will ensure proper administration of the election process”.`
    
    - `We therefore urge the Government to think again about these measures, to remove the provisions, and to work with the Commission and Speaker’s Committee to ensure that suitable accountability arrangements are in place to ensure confidence across the political spectrum. Strong accountability is essential for this, but so too is demonstrable independence. The Commission’s independent role in the electoral system must be clear for voters and campaigners to see, and preserved in electoral law.`
