### 2023 Illegal Migration Bill
- On 7 March 2023, Sunak announced plans to introduce new laws to help tackle the small boats coming from France.
    
    - `Earlier this year the Prime Minister made stopping the boats one of his 5 promises to the British people. The ‘Stop the Boats’ – or Illegal Migration – Bill will fulfil that promise by ending illegal entry as a route to asylum in the UK.  
    -   
    - This will remove the incentive for people to risk their lives through these dangerous and unnecessary journeys and pull the rug from under the criminal gangs profiting from this misery once and for all.  
    -   
    - ...  
    -   
    - Summary of bill measures:  
    -   
    - duty to make arrangements for removal - the Home Secretary will have a legal duty to remove people who have entered the UK illegally  
    -   
    - detention and bail - strengthening detention powers so people can only apply for bail from the courts (First-tier Tribunal) after 28 days (although habeus corpus will remain)  
    -   
    - unaccompanied children - minors who come to the UK illegally will not be removed to a safe third country until adulthood, except in limited circumstances  
    -   
    - entry, citizenship and settlement - people who come to the UK illegally will be prevented from settling in the country and will face a permanent ban from returning  
    -   
    - asylum - people who come here illegally will have their asylum claims deemed inadmissible and considered in a safe third country  
    -   
    - modern slavery - modern slavery referrals for those who come to the UK illegally will be disqualified under public order grounds under the terms of the international anti-trafficking treaty, ECAT  
    -   
    - legal proceedings - limiting the circumstances in which legal challenges will prevent someone from being removed from the UK, most legal challenges will be considered when someone has been successfully removed from the UK  
    -   
    - expanding the list of countries that are considered safe in law - this will make it unquestionably clear when someone doesn’t need our protection because they are obviously not at risk of persecution in their home country  
    -   
    - annual number of people using safe and legal routes - committing to resettling a specific number of refugees in the UK every year`

- On the first page of the `as introduced` version of the bill, it states that Braverman could not guarantee that the bill was compatible with the European Court of Human Rights' laws.
    
    - `Secretary Suella Braverman has made the following statement under section 19(1)(b) of the Human Rights Act 1998:  
    -   
    - I am unable to make a statement that, in my view, the provisions of the Illegal Migration Bill are compatible with the Convention rights, but the Government nevertheless wishes the House to proceed with the Bill.`

- On 7 March 2023, The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) expressed she is firmly opposed to the policy saying the plan amounts to an asylum ban.
    
    - `UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, is profoundly concerned by the asylum bill introduced by the UK Government to the House of Commons today. In its current form, the Bill compels the Home Secretary to deny access to the UK asylum system to those who arrive irregularly. Rather than being provided with protection, these asylum-seekers would instead be subject to detention in the UK, while arrangements are pursued to remove them to another country.  
    -   
    - The legislation, if passed, would amount to an asylum ban – extinguishing the right to seek refugee protection in the United Kingdom for those who arrive irregularly, no matter how genuine and compelling their claim may be, and with no consideration of their individual circumstances.  
    -   
    - The effect of the bill (in this form) would be to deny protection to many asylum-seekers in need of safety and protection, and even deny them the opportunity to put forward their case. This would be a clear breach of the Refugee Convention and would undermine a longstanding, humanitarian tradition of which the British people are rightly proud.`

- On 7 March 2023, Braverman stated the bill attempts to stretch the boundaries of international law and that there is a more than 50% chance that the bill is not compatible with the ECHR.
    
    - `Suella Braverman has admitted the government is attempting to push “the boundaries of international law” with legislation aimed at reducing small boat crossings in the Channel.` - [link](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/07/suella-braverman-small-boats-plan-push-boundaries-international-law-rishi-sunak)
    
    - `when introducing a bill for its second reading before the House of Commons, a minister must tell MPs that they are either confident it is compatible with the ECHR or that they are unable to say it is compatible but they wish to proceed with it anyway.  
    -   
    - When introducing the Illegal Migration Bill, Suella Braverman opted for the latter, telling MPs "that there is a more than 50% chance" that provisions in the new law "may not be compatible".`
