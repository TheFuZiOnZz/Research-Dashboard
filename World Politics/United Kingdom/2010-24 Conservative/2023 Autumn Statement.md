### Economic Analysis
- On 22 November 2023, The Office of Budget Responsibility released a `Economic and Fiscal Outlook` Report on the Autumn Statement which said:
    
    - `While real GDP growth has been stronger so far this year than we anticipated in March, we expect it to cool over the second half of 2023. Quarterly real GDP growth was 0.3 per cent in the first quarter of 2023 and 0.2 per cent in the second quarter whereas, in March, we expected output to contract by 0.4 per cent over the two quarters. But we think that this unexpected strength will be reversed in the coming quarters. This is because interest rates have risen by more than expected in March which should weigh on activity. Business surveys and consumer confidence measures are also consistent with weak near-term growth. Therefore, we forecast GDP to remain flat in the third quarter of 2023 and only grow by 0.1 per cent in the fourth quarter, below the combined growth of 0.7 per cent we expected in March. This results in an annual growth forecast of only 0.6 per cent in 2023.  
    -   
    - We expect growth to remain subdued at 0.7 per cent in 2024 as a result of weak real wage growth, the effect of past increases in interest rates and fading fiscal support weighing on economic activity. It is plausible that only around half the impact of the past substantial rise in interest rates has yet fed through to the economy, with the rising share of fixed rate mortgages in recent years slowing the pass-through from mortgage rates to household disposable incomes.In our central forecast, growth picks up to 1.4 per cent in 2025 and 2.0 per cent in 2026 and 2027 as inflation falls back from recent elevated rates and provides a further boost to real wage growth. A fading in the effect of past interest rate increases and the outright falls in rates in our conditioning assumptions also push up on GDP growth relative to supply growth. Growth then drops back towards our new estimate of medium-term potential output growth of 1.6 per cent in 2028.`

    - `There is significant uncertainty around our GDP growth forecast. The left-hand side of Chart 2.10 illustrates our central forecast for real GDP growth within a fan chart. The shaded areas illustrate the probability of different growth outcomes, conditioned on the size of past forecast errors since 1988. These uncertainty bands imply that there is around a 1 in 4 chance that real GDP growth will be negative in the latter half of the forecast and a similar probability that growth will exceed 4 per cent. But, as with our inflation fan chart, this likely understates the uncertainty around our current forecast give the scale and array of risks we currently face. The right-hand panel of Chart 2.10 shows how many of the recent errors around our forecast fall well outside our historic distribution, owing to the shocks of the pandemic and energy crisis. An uncertain outlook for energy prices, inflation, and productivity growth pose particular risks to our forecast. Chapter 5 presents scenarios showing how different paths for inflation and real output growth affect the public finances.` [link](https://obr.uk/docs/dlm_uploads/E03004355_November-Economic-and-Fiscal-Outlook_Web-Accessible.pdf)
    
- On 22 November 2023, The Institute for Fiscal Studies released a response to the Autumn Statement which said:
    
    - `The public finances haven’t meaningfully improved. The growth outlook has weakened. Inflation is expected to stay higher for longer. Higher inflation pushes up tax receipts by more than it pushes up spending on debt interest or social security benefits; but rather than use the proceeds to ease the ongoing ‘fiscal drag’ effects of threshold freezes, or to compensate public services for higher costs, the Chancellor opted to cut other taxes. His immediate cut to National Insurance will put more money into workers’ pockets when it comes in but won’t be enough to prevent this from being the biggest tax-raising parliament in modern times. These cuts will also not stop tax revenues rising to their highest ever levels. The “full expensing” cut to corporation tax is a welcome extension of the temporary cut announced in March and, alongside a slew of other reforms, does indicate that this was an event focused on medium term growth as well as a pre election giveaway.` [link](https://ifs.org.uk/Autumn-Statement-2023-response)
    
    - `Despite some near-term good news on growth this year, the OBR delivered a gloomier outlook for real growth going forward. Annual growth in the economy from 2024 to 2027 is now forecast to average 1.5% per year, compared with 2.1% per year in March. ` [link](https://ifs.org.uk/Autumn-Statement-2023-response)  
    - The headline measures in this Autumn Statement were cuts to the rates of National Insurance Contributions for employees and the self-employed. Taken in isolation, these put money back into the pockets of almost 30 million workers at a cost of around £10 billion per year, with anyone earning at least £12,570, or making profits of at least £6,725, per year benefitting.  
    -   
    - The bigger picture is that these changes give back less than £1 of every £4 that is being taken away from households through changes to NICs and income tax announced since March 2021. Those takeaways are far less transparent than the smaller giveaway announced today - implemented as they are through multi-year freezes to income tax and NICs thresholds, which gradually bring more and more people into higher tax brackets, and especially so at a time of high inflation.`  
    - [link](https://ifs.org.uk/Autumn-Statement-2023-response)
    
    - `Today, the Chancellor made ‘full expensing’ permanent. This allows companies to deduct 100% of qualifying plant and machinery investment immediately when calculating their taxable profits.  
    -   
    - Isaac Delestre, a Research Economist at the IFS, said: “The Chancellor described the change as ‘the biggest business tax cut in modern British history’. It is not. The OBR estimates that the policy will cost almost £11 billion in 2028-29. But the ultimate cost of full expensing is much lower: around £1–3 billion a year (in today’s terms). This is because most of the up-front cost will be recouped in later years: under full expensing, firms deduct investment costs immediately which they would otherwise deduct gradually over time.`  
    - [link](https://ifs.org.uk/Autumn-Statement-2023-response)
    
    - `Higher inflation has led to buoyant tax revenues, but does not automatically feed through into higher departmental budgets, which are fixed in cash terms. That means those budgets are worth less in real terms: they can purchase fewer goods and services. The upshot is that by 2027-28, the OBR estimates that the real value of departmental budgets will have been eroded by £19 billion. The government could have used the tax proceeds from higher inflation to compensate departments. Instead, they announced £20 billion of tax cuts.  
    -   
    - Plans beyond 2025 imply making cuts to some ‘unprotected’ areas (like local government, or prisons) and imply big cuts to the level of public investment. Such are the scale of these planned cuts to investment that even Labour’s £20 billion-a-year boost to green investment might not be enough to offset them. The public finance forecasts are predicated on these tight spending plans being delivered.`

2019- Fracking
- In the 2019 Conservative Manifesto, it mentioned not supporting fracking.
    
    - `We placed a moratorium on fracking in England with immediate effect. Having listened to local communities, we have ruled out changes to the planning system. We will not support fracking unless the science shows categorically that it can be done safely.` [link](https://assets-global.website-files.com/5da42e2cae7ebd3f8bde353c/5dda924905da587992a064ba_Conservative%202019%20Manifesto.pdf)
    
- In February 2022 the Oil & Gas Authority ordered the "plugging and abandonment" of Britain's shale wells.
    
    - `The owner of the shale fracking company Cuadrilla will permanently plug and abandon its two shale wells in Lancashire, drawing a line on Britain’s failed fracking industry.  
    -   
    - Cuadrilla set out plans to permanently seal the two shale gas wells drilled at the Preston New Road Lancashire shale exploration site a little over two years after the government brought an end to fracking in England.  
    -   
    - Francis Egan, the chief executive of Cuadrilla, said the government’s oil and gas regulator had ordered the “ridiculous” shutdown of the wells in the northern Bowland Shale gas formation despite Europe’s gas supply crisis.`

- On 22 September 2022, Rees-Mogg defended fracking saying the science is misunderstood.
    
    - `Rees-Mogg insisted fracking in England would drive down global gas prices and that opposition to it was “sheer ludditery”, often based on the public misunderstanding the science.  
    -   
    - “It is safe. It is shown to be safe,” Rees-Mogg said. “The scare stories have been disproved time and again. The hysteria about seismic activity, I think, fails to understand that the Richter scale is a logarithmic scale. People seem to think it is a straight arithmetic scale, which of course it is not.”`

- On 29 September 2022, Truss made public the idea of acquiring local consent to start with fracking operations.
    
    - `Liz Truss has refused to give details of how local consent would be given for fracking in a particular area, amid growing evidence that it will be pushed through as a national infrastructure project.  
    -   
    - ...  
    -   
    - The presenter Graham Liver asked her: “We are the only area of the country that has done it, and it caused earthquakes, people’s houses shook. Why do you think it is safe to continue, because none of the science has changed?”  
    -   
    - Truss replied: “What I want to be clear about is we will only press ahead with fracking in areas where there is local community support for that … Fracking is carried out perfectly safely in various parts of the world, and the business secretary will make sure that any fracking that takes place is safe.”`

- On 26 October 2022, Sunak during Prime Ministers Question’s said he will reinstate the ban as was committed in the 2019 Manifesto.
    
    - `Rishi Sunak will reinstate the England-wide moratorium on shale gas fracking that was temporarily lifted by his predecessor Liz Truss, a senior government insider has confirmed.  
    -   
    - During his first prime minister’s questions in the House of Commons on Wednesday, the new UK prime minister told MPs that he “stands by” the Conservative party’s 2019 manifesto commitment that halted fracking. The overarching ban was briefly lifted by Truss during her brief period as prime minister.`

### Research Studies
- A 2014 Government Report found that:
    
    - `At present there is limited environmental and health surveillance data within the published literature in relation to existing shale gas extraction operations. There have been very few epidemiological studies and those that have been carried out generally lack robust exposure assessments. A few studies have suggested associations between adverse health impacts and shale gas extraction activities; however, the authors have highlighted a number of limitations within these studies and it is evident that further work is required. The UK has an opportunity, in advance of significant development of shale gas extraction activities, to consider appropriate environmental and epidemiological studies to strengthen the evidence base on potential health impacts. However, the challenge for any investigation is that potential  
    - emissions associated with shale gas extraction activities are generally common to a number of other sources, such as industry and traffic, making it difficult to clearly attribute any exposures to shale gas extraction activities.  
    -   
    - In conclusion, the currently available evidence indicates that the potential risks to public health from exposure to the emissions associated with shale gas extraction will be low if the operations are properly run and regulated. In order to ensure this, regulation needs to be strongly and robustly applied.`

- A 2017 Paper found that:
    
    - `No consensus can be tentatively allocated to air quality; resulting public health risks and land use as results are often contradictory with no obvious trend, partially because limited studies exist due to the inherent difficulties associated with this type of studies.` [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1007/s11356-017-8970-0) - Extensive review of shale gas environmental impacts from scientific literature (2010–2015), Costa et al., 2017
    
- A 2018 Paper found that:
    
    - `What we find in this scoping review is that the best information available about human health impacts and HVHF is very limited. At this point, only imperfect information is available: not everyone has access to the same quality of information. For every careful study similar to many of those in this scoping review, there are many highly publicized sources of information that are based on opinion, bias, or self-interest that add nothing to the clinician’s toolkit or ability to make a good judgment. Without quality information about the health impacts of HVHF, primary care providers are limited in their ability to identify the source of patient symptoms as well as in their ability to keep their patients accurately informed about potential risks associated with HVHF.` [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1097/JOM.0000000000001278) - High-Volume Hydraulic Fracturing and Human Health Outcomes: A Scoping Review, Wright and Muma, 2018
    
- A 2019 Systematic Review found that:
    
    - `We found 20 published epidemiologic studies that evaluate potential associations between ONG operations and health outcomes. These studies assessed 32 different health outcomes ranging from self-reported symptoms to confirmed disease diagnoses. Since only a few outcomes were covered by multiple studies, there was insufficient weight of evidence for most health outcomes. We found studies of populations living near ONG operations provide limited evidence (modest scientific findings that support the outcome, but with significant limitations) of harmful health effects including asthma exacerbations and various self-reported symptoms. For all other health outcomes, we found conflicting evidence (mixed), insufficient evidence, or in some cases, a lack of evidence of the possibility for harmful health effects.` [link](https://sci-hub.ee/10.3390/ijerph16122123) - A Systematic Review of the Epidemiologic Literature Assessing Health Outcomes in Populations Living near Oil and Natural Gas Operations: Study Quality and Future Recommendations, Bamber et al., 2019
