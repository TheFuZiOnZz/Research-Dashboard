    > `It is my view that Mr Bridgen has breached the rules on lobbying when he initiated the approaches summarised in paragraph 98.

The approaches listed above were all made within six months following receipt of those rewards.

    > It is my view that Mr Bridgen breached the rules on lobbying when he participated in approaches summarised in paragraph 100. His approaches sought to confer a financial benefit on Mere Plantations, from whom he had received an outside award. The permission in the rule is not triggered as the approaches were initiated by Mr Bridgen and sought to confer a benefit exclusively on Mere Plantations. The approaches listed above were all made within the six months following receipt of those outside rewards.`

- On 26 November 2022, Bridgen appealed against the decision made by the Standards Committee.
    
    > `Tory MP Andrew Bridgen is appealing against his recommended suspension after he was found to have displayed a “very cavalier” attitude to the rules in a series of lobbying breaches. The backbencher was referring the Commons’ Standards Committee’s damning decision to Parliament’s Independent Expert Panel despite previously accepting the findings. At the time the punishment was recommended by the cross-party committee earlier this month, the North West Leicestershire MP said he was “extremely disappointed” with the findings but added “I accept them and will comply with them as required to do so”.` [link](https://www.itv.com/news/central/2022-11-26/tory-mp-andrew-bridgen-appeals-against-lobbying-breach-suspension)

    > `Tory MP Andrew Bridgen has failed in his bid to overturn his recommended five-day suspension for a “very cavalier” series of breaches of lobbying rules. The Independent Expert Panel (IEP) dismissed his appeal “on all grounds” and told the backbencher that he could reasonably have been handed a “more severe” punishment. The North West Leicestershire MP initially accepted the Commons Standards Committee’s findings, before calling for a reversal by Parliament’s appeal panel.` [link](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/andrew-bridgen-commons-mps-b2248585.html)

He was unsuccessful in an attempt to overturn the recommendation in December and a motion was approved by parliament on Monday. The suspension is due to start on Tuesday 10 January, and will run for five sitting days.` [link](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jan/09/andrew-bridgen-suspended-from-house-of-commons-over-lobbying)
