### 2022 Suella Braverman, Manston Migrant Centre
- On 31 October 2022, it was reported that Braverman didn’t sign off on living accommodation for channel crossing migrants.
    
    - `The source told me that Suella Braverman failed to sign off accommodation and that decision not to take on extra accommodation is going to be potentially very difficult for the home secretary.  
    -   
    - Two Home Office sources told me that the decision is likely to face a judicial review because the law requires that people are held in these conditions for 24 to 48 hours only, when in reality people are being held there for weeks at a time.  
    -   
    - The question for the home secretary will be whether she ignored official advice and did not sign off on accommodation when she should have done.`
