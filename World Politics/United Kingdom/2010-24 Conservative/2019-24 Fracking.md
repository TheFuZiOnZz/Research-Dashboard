- In the 2019 Conservative Manifesto, it mentioned not supporting fracking.
    
    - `We placed a moratorium on fracking in England with immediate effect. Having listened to local communities, we have ruled out changes to the planning system. We will not support fracking unless the science shows categorically that it can be done safely.` [link](https://assets-global.website-files.com/5da42e2cae7ebd3f8bde353c/5dda924905da587992a064ba_Conservative%202019%20Manifesto.pdf)
    
- In February 2022 the Oil & Gas Authority ordered the "plugging and abandonment" of Britain's shale wells.
    
    - `The owner of the shale fracking company Cuadrilla will permanently plug and abandon its two shale wells in Lancashire, drawing a line on Britain’s failed fracking industry.  
    -   
    - Cuadrilla set out plans to permanently seal the two shale gas wells drilled at the Preston New Road Lancashire shale exploration site a little over two years after the government brought an end to fracking in England.  
    -   
    - Francis Egan, the chief executive of Cuadrilla, said the government’s oil and gas regulator had ordered the “ridiculous” shutdown of the wells in the northern Bowland Shale gas formation despite Europe’s gas supply crisis.`

- On 22 September 2022, Rees-Mogg defended fracking saying the science is misunderstood.
    
    - `Rees-Mogg insisted fracking in England would drive down global gas prices and that opposition to it was “sheer ludditery”, often based on the public misunderstanding the science.  
    -   
    - “It is safe. It is shown to be safe,” Rees-Mogg said. “The scare stories have been disproved time and again. The hysteria about seismic activity, I think, fails to understand that the Richter scale is a logarithmic scale. People seem to think it is a straight arithmetic scale, which of course it is not.”`

- On 29 September 2022, Truss made public the idea of acquiring local consent to start with fracking operations.
    
    - `Liz Truss has refused to give details of how local consent would be given for fracking in a particular area, amid growing evidence that it will be pushed through as a national infrastructure project.  
    -   
    - ...  
    -   
    - The presenter Graham Liver asked her: “We are the only area of the country that has done it, and it caused earthquakes, people’s houses shook. Why do you think it is safe to continue, because none of the science has changed?”  
    -   
    - Truss replied: “What I want to be clear about is we will only press ahead with fracking in areas where there is local community support for that … Fracking is carried out perfectly safely in various parts of the world, and the business secretary will make sure that any fracking that takes place is safe.”`

- On 19 October 2022, the House of commons voted against banning fracking with 326 votes against, 324 being Conservative MPs. [link](https://votes.parliament.uk/Votes/Commons/Division/1372?byMember=False)

- On 26 October 2022, Sunak during Prime Ministers Question’s said he will reinstate the ban as was committed in the 2019 Manifesto.
    
    - `Rishi Sunak will reinstate the England-wide moratorium on shale gas fracking that was temporarily lifted by his predecessor Liz Truss, a senior government insider has confirmed.  
    -   
    - During his first prime minister’s questions in the House of Commons on Wednesday, the new UK prime minister told MPs that he “stands by” the Conservative party’s 2019 manifesto commitment that halted fracking. The overarching ban was briefly lifted by Truss during her brief period as prime minister.`

# Research Studies
- A 2014 Government Report found that:
    
    - `At present there is limited environmental and health surveillance data within the published literature in relation to existing shale gas extraction operations. There have been very few epidemiological studies and those that have been carried out generally lack robust exposure assessments. A few studies have suggested associations between adverse health impacts and shale gas extraction activities; however, the authors have highlighted a number of limitations within these studies and it is evident that further work is required. The UK has an opportunity, in advance of significant development of shale gas extraction activities, to consider appropriate environmental and epidemiological studies to strengthen the evidence base on potential health impacts. However, the challenge for any investigation is that potential  
    - emissions associated with shale gas extraction activities are generally common to a number of other sources, such as industry and traffic, making it difficult to clearly attribute any exposures to shale gas extraction activities.  
    -   
    - In conclusion, the currently available evidence indicates that the potential risks to public health from exposure to the emissions associated with shale gas extraction will be low if the operations are properly run and regulated. In order to ensure this, regulation needs to be strongly and robustly applied.`

- A 2017 Paper found that:
    
    - `No consensus can be tentatively allocated to air quality; resulting public health risks and land use as results are often contradictory with no obvious trend, partially because limited studies exist due to the inherent difficulties associated with this type of studies.` [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1007/s11356-017-8970-0) - Extensive review of shale gas environmental impacts from scientific literature (2010–2015), Costa et al., 2017
    
- A 2018 Paper found that:
    
    - `What we find in this scoping review is that the best information available about human health impacts and HVHF is very limited. At this point, only imperfect information is available: not everyone has access to the same quality of information. For every careful study similar to many of those in this scoping review, there are many highly publicized sources of information that are based on opinion, bias, or self-interest that add nothing to the clinician’s toolkit or ability to make a good judgment. Without quality information about the health impacts of HVHF, primary care providers are limited in their ability to identify the source of patient symptoms as well as in their ability to keep their patients accurately informed about potential risks associated with HVHF.` [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1097/JOM.0000000000001278) - High-Volume Hydraulic Fracturing and Human Health Outcomes: A Scoping Review, Wright and Muma, 2018
    
- A 2019 Systematic Review found that:
    
    - `We found 20 published epidemiologic studies that evaluate potential associations between ONG operations and health outcomes. These studies assessed 32 different health outcomes ranging from self-reported symptoms to confirmed disease diagnoses. Since only a few outcomes were covered by multiple studies, there was insufficient weight of evidence for most health outcomes. We found studies of populations living near ONG operations provide limited evidence (modest scientific findings that support the outcome, but with significant limitations) of harmful health effects including asthma exacerbations and various self-reported symptoms. For all other health outcomes, we found conflicting evidence (mixed), insufficient evidence, or in some cases, a lack of evidence of the possibility for harmful health effects.` [link](https://sci-hub.ee/10.3390/ijerph16122123) - A Systematic Review of the Epidemiologic Literature Assessing Health Outcomes in Populations Living near Oil and Natural Gas Operations: Study Quality and Future Recommendations, Bamber et al., 2019
