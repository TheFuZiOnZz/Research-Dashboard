### 2022 Johnson’s City Hall Job Scandal
- On 9 July 2022, it was reported that Johnson allegedly pushed to attain a job for a young woman who claims he abused his power to have a sexual relationship with her.
    
    - `The ousted prime minister allegedly advocated for a role for the woman in 2008, just weeks after they met, while he was serving as Mayor of London. The Sunday Times said the unnamed woman was interviewed for a City Hall job when Mr Johnson was married. The appointment is said to have been blocked because his colleague, Kit Malthouse, now a minister in the outgoing PM's caretaker Cabinet, said the pair appeared to have an inappropriately close relationship. The newspaper reported that the woman was upset by what happened, confronting Mr Johnson about it several years later. She recorded her conversation with the then Foreign Secretary, telling him she was “really shaken and upset” about what had happened and that she regretted their relationship had become sexual. She continued saying his behaviour was an example of how “anyone who steps into this building is fair game” and were there to be “leered at” by powerful men.` [link](https://www.lbc.co.uk/news/boris-johnson-city-hall-job-abuse-of-power-relationship/)
