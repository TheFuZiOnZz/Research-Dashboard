### 2021 Initial Media Reports
- On 30 November 2021, the Daily Mirror first reported on 10 Downing Street staff gatherings during the 2020 Christmas season.
    
    - `Boris Johnson and his Downing Street staff have been accused of breaking Covid rules by attending parties at Number 10 in the run-up to last Christmas. The Prime Minister gave a speech at a packed leaving do for a top aide last November when the country was in the grip of its second lockdown. Then just days before Christmas, with London in tier 3 restrictions, members of his top team held their own festive bash in Downing Street. Officials knocked back glasses of wine during a Christmas quiz and a Secret Santa while the rest of the country was forced to stay at home.` [link](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/boris-johnson-broke-covid-lockdown-25585238)
    
- On 7 December 2021, ITV News released a video, in which Allegra Stratton, the Then-Downing Street Press Secretary, and other Downing Street staff during a mock press conference on 22 December 2020 made joking references to a Christmas gathering in 10 Downing Street four days earlier on 18 December 2020.
    
    - `Ed Oldfield, adviser to the prime minister, asks: “I’ve just seen reports on Twitter that there was a Downing Street Christmas party on Friday night, do you recognise those reports?”  
    -   
    - “I went home”, replies Ms Stratton, laughing, before composing herself, telling colleagues to "hold on", as she appears to consider what her answer should be.  
    -   
    - “Umm, errr, ahhhh,” are the noises she makes as she looks around the room, apparently stuck for words.  
    -   
    - Following a long pause, Mr Oldfield asks: “Would the prime minister condone having a Christmas party?”  
    -   
    - Ms Stratton laughs, looking down, before responding, “what’s the answer?”  
    -   
    - Staff then attempt to help the PM’s former spokesperson formulate a response.  
    -   
    - “It wasn’t a party, it was cheese and wine”, replies one.  
    -   
    - “Is cheese and wine alright?” Ms Stratton asks. At that point the staff member who made the cheese and wine comment seems to say "No... joking".  
    -   
    - Ms Stratton adds “it was a business meeting”, as she laughs again.  
    -   
    - She then warns her colleagues, “this is recorded” and states through more laughter, “this fictional party was a business meeting and it was not socially distanced.”`

    - `The footage, obtained by ITV, was shot on 22 December 2020. The Friday before was 18 December, the date on which multiple sources have said there was a staff party inside Downing Street, which would have contravened strict Covid regulations in place at the time.` [link](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/07/leaked-video-shows-no-10-officials-joking-about-holding-christmas-party)
    
- On 7 December 2021, The Times reported allegations that the party was organised via WhatsApp with staff requested to bring Secret Santa gifts.
    
    - `An alleged Christmas party in breach of lockdown rules held in Downing Street was organised by civil servants, The Times has been told. The party last year is understood to have been organised via a WhatsApp group with staff asked to bring “Secret Santa” presents. Some of those present also wore Christmas jumpers. About 30 people are understood to have attended the event. Some staff working in other parts of the building are said to have joined in the festivities later in an “impromptu” way. Staff brought the alcohol and food provided, which were not paid for by the government.` [link](https://archive.ph/H5V52)
    
### 2021 Initial Responses to Media Reports
- On 8 December 2021, Johnson apologised for the video during Prime Minister's Questions, describing himself as furious about it, but continued to deny that a party had taken place and declared that an investigation would be undertaken by Cabinet Secretary Simon Case. Johnson also stated that all guidance was followed at all times
    
    - Boris Johnson: `May I begin by saying that I understand and share the anger up and down the country at seeing No. 10 staff seeming to make light of lockdown measures? I can understand how infuriating it must be to think that the people who have been setting the rules have not been following the rules, because I was also furious to see that clip. I apologise unreservedly for the offence that it has caused up and down the country, and I apologise for the impression that it gives.  
    -   
    - I repeat that I have been repeatedly assured since these allegations emerged that there was no party and that no covid rules were broken. That is what I have been repeatedly assured. But I have asked the Cabinet Secretary to establish all the facts and to report back as soon as possible. It goes without saying that if those rules were broken, there will be disciplinary action for all those involved.`

    - Catherine West: `Will the Prime Minister tell the House whether there was a party in Downing Street on 13 November?`  
    -   
    - Boris Johnson: `No, but I am sure that whatever happened, the guidance was followed and the rules were followed at all times.`

- Three hours later, Stratton resigned from her position as government spokesperson for the COP26 summit and apologised for her remarks which she asserted she would regret for the rest of her days.
    
    - `Mr Johnson's former press chief Allegra Stratton - who was filmed joking with colleagues about the party in a video leaked to ITV - resigned as a government adviser three hours after the PM's apology. In a tearful statement, she said: "My remarks seemed to make light of the rules, rules that people were doing everything to obey. "That was never my intention. I will regret those remarks for the rest of my days and I offer my profound apologies to all of you at home for them."` [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-59580640) [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-59584736)
    
- On 17 December 2021, it was announced that Case would no longer lead the inquiry following reports that a party had been held in his own office on 17 December 2020. The inquiry was taken over by senior civil servant Sue Gray, Second Permanent Secretary in the Cabinet Office.
    
    - `The UK's top civil servant has stepped aside from his role leading an inquiry into Downing Street lockdown parties, after it emerged an event was held in his own office. Simon Case had been due to report on claims Covid rules were broken at events for staff last year. But his role was put into doubt after reports a party was held in his office while London was under Covid rules. No 10 said the probe would be concluded by senior civil servant Sue Gray.` [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-59701369)
    
### 2022 Police Investigation
- On 24 January 2022, A police inquiry, called Operation Hillman, was started into 12 gatherings on 8 different days.
    
    - `The comments from Number 10 come after the Metropolitan Police announced it was launching an investigation into a "number of" gatherings during COVID-19 restrictions in 2020 and 2021, putting more pressure on the prime minister.  
    -   
    - Speaking in the Commons, Mr Johnson told MPs: "I welcome the Met's decision to conduct its own investigation because I believe this will help to give the public the clarity it needs and help to draw a line under matters."`  
    - [link](https://news.sky.com/story/met-launches-investigation-into-a-number-of-downing-street-events-12524866)
    
- On 19 May 2022, the Metropolitan Police said that they had completed their investigations, with the police concluding that offences were committed on 8 different dates.
    
    - `In total, detectives have made 126 referrals for fixed penalty notices (FPNs) to the ACRO Criminal Records Office for breaches of Covid-19 regulations.`  
    -   
    - ...  
    -   
    - `Of the referrals, all resulted or will do so in a FPN being issued. In total, this refers to 83 individuals. The breakdown of recipients is 53 FPNs were issued to 35 men and 73 FPNs to 48 women. A total of 28 people received between two and five referrals.`  
    -   
    - ...  
    -   
    - `Acting Deputy Commissioner Helen Ball, of the Met said: “There is no doubt that the pandemic impacted all of us in so many ways and strong feelings and opinions have been expressed on this particular issue. When Covid regulations were introduced, the Met was clear that whilst we would not routinely investigate breaches of regulations retrospectively, there may be occasions when it would be appropriate to do so. The information that we received with regard to the alleged breaches in Downing Street and Whitehall was sufficient to reach our criteria to begin such an investigation. Our investigation was thorough and impartial and was completed as quickly as we could, given the amount of information that needed to be reviewed and the importance of ensuring that we had strong evidence for each FPN referral. This investigation is now complete.”`

### 2022 Interim Sue Gray Report
- On 31 January 2022, Due to their being an ongoing Police Investigation, Sue Gray released an initial update report on `Investigation Into Alleged Gatherings on Government Premises During Covid Restrictions`. [link](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1051374/Investigation_into_alleged_gatherings_on_government_premises_during_Covid_restrictions_-_Update.pdf)
    
    - `Against the backdrop of the pandemic, when the Government was asking citizens to accept far-reaching restrictions on their lives, some of the behaviour surrounding these gatherings is difficult to justify.`
    
    - `At least some of the gatherings in question represent a serious failure to observe not just the high standards expected of those working at the heart of Government but also of the standards expected of the entire British population at the time.`
    
    - `At times it seems there was too little thought given to what was happening across the country in considering the appropriateness of some of these gatherings, the risks they presented to public health and how they might appear  
    - to the public. There were failures of leadership and judgment by different parts of No 10 and the Cabinet Office at different times. Some of the events should not have been allowed to take place. Other events should not have been  
    - allowed to develop as they did.`  
    
    - `The excessive consumption of alcohol is not appropriate in a professional workplace at any time. Steps must be taken to ensure that every Government Department has a clear and robust policy in place covering the consumption of alcohol in the workplace.`
    
    - `The use of the garden at No 10 Downing Street should be primarily for the Prime Minister and the private residents of No 10 and No 11 Downing Street. During the pandemic it was often used as an extension of the workplace as a  
    - more covid secure means of holding group meetings in a ventilated space. This was a sensible measure that staff appreciated, but the garden was also used for gatherings without clear authorisation or oversight. This was not  
    - appropriate. Any official access to the space, including for meetings, should be by invitation only and in a controlled environment.`  
    
    - `Some staff wanted to raise concerns about behaviours they witnessed at work but at times felt unable to do so. No member of staff should feel unable to report or challenge poor conduct where they witness it. There should be easier ways for staff to raise such concerns informally, outside of the line management chain.`
    
    - `The gatherings within the scope of this investigation are spread over a 20-month period – a period that has been unique in recent times in terms of the complexity and breadth of the demands on public servants and indeed the general public. The whole of the country rose to the challenge. Ministers, special advisers and the Civil Service, of which I am proud to be a part, were a key and dedicated part of that national effort. However, as I have noted, a number of these gatherings should not have been allowed to take place or to develop in the way that they did. There is significant learning to be drawn from these events which must be addressed immediately across Government. This does not need to wait for the police investigations to be concluded.`

Lee Cain, the then No 10 Director of Communications (a special adviser), also received the invitation. In response, he emailed Martin Reynolds, No 10 official (1), and Dominic Cummings at 14.35 on 20 May 2020 stating: ‘I’m sure it will be fine - and I applaud the gesture - but a 200 odd person invitation for drinks in the garden of no 10 is somewhat of a comms risk in the current environment.’ Lee Cain says he subsequently spoke to Martin Reynolds and advised him that the event should be cancelled. Martin Reynolds does not recall any such conversation. In addition, Dominic Cummings has also said that he too raised concerns, in writing. We have not found any documentary evidence of this.` [[p11/12]](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1078404/2022-05-25_FINAL_FINDINGS_OF_SECOND_PERMANENT_SECRETARY_INTO_ALLEGED_GATHERINGS.pdf)
        
        - `This event was also referenced in a subsequent Whatsapp message on an unknown date from Martin Reynolds to a special adviser: [Martin Reynolds] [19:36] 'Best of luck - a complete non story but better than them focusing on our drinks (which we seem to have got away with).'` [[p12/13]](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1078404/2022-05-25_FINAL_FINDINGS_OF_SECOND_PERMANENT_SECRETARY_INTO_ALLEGED_GATHERINGS.pdf)

But it obviously comes with rather substantial comms risks” [[p13/14]](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1078404/2022-05-25_FINAL_FINDINGS_OF_SECOND_PERMANENT_SECRETARY_INTO_ALLEGED_GATHERINGS.pdf)

They joined the other members of the Private Office, including No 10 official (1), already in the waiting room. Some brought pizza and prosecco and they were followed by others, over the next couple of hours. Helen MacNamara, Deputy Cabinet Secretary, attended for part of the evening and provided a karaoke machine which was set up in an adjoining office to the waiting room.` [[p15]](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1078404/2022-05-25_FINAL_FINDINGS_OF_SECOND_PERMANENT_SECRETARY_INTO_ALLEGED_GATHERINGS.pdf)

PM birthday today - we’ve organised some sandwiches and cake for about 1pm in the Cabinet Room if anyone from your team would like to pop in and wish him a happy birthday....” [Cleo Watson] [09:09] “Have sent this to policy, press and e&v heads.

        - `The Prime Minister was not aware of this event in advance and it did not form part of his official diary for the day. He returned from an external visit to No 10 Downing Street at approximately 14.20 and was taken into the Cabinet Room which had been set up with sandwiches, snacks, soft drinks and cans of beer. Those attending included No 10 officials and Mrs. Johnson. The Permanent Secretary for Covid and Pandemic Response, Simon Case, attended for a short period having arrived early for a meeting which was due to take place in the Cabinet room.

Five special advisers attended. The Prime Minister joined them at about 20.00. Food and alcohol were available. The discussion carried on later into the evening with attendees leaving at various points. The information collected on this gathering is limited as the process of obtaining evidence had only just been commenced when the Metropolitan Police announced their own investigations, which included events on the 13 November 2020. At this point I stopped my investigation, given the need to avoid any prejudice to the police investigation. Following the Metropolitan Police announcement on 19 May 2022 I considered whether or not to conduct any further investigation into this event but concluded it was not appropriate or proportionate to do so.` [[p18]](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1078404/2022-05-25_FINAL_FINDINGS_OF_SECOND_PERMANENT_SECRETARY_INTO_ALLEGED_GATHERINGS.pdf)

His Private Office team remained in the office chatting and finishing their drinks and snacks.` [[p25]](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1078404/2022-05-25_FINAL_FINDINGS_OF_SECOND_PERMANENT_SECRETARY_INTO_ALLEGED_GATHERINGS.pdf)

        - `The event began at approximately 18.00 as a work-related meeting to discuss how the office would run over the Christmas break. At approximately 19.00, formal leaving speeches began for No 10 Officials (1) and (2). There were around 20 people in the room from across No 10 but predominantly from the Private Office staff. Other members of staff joined virtually. Approximately five bottles of wine were provided for those attending. The Prime Minister attended for around 15 minutes from 19.50 to 20.05, giving a speech thanking both No 10 Officials (1) and (2) before returning to his office for further meetings. There were also speeches by other officials.` [[p26]](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1078404/2022-05-25_FINAL_FINDINGS_OF_SECOND_PERMANENT_SECRETARY_INTO_ALLEGED_GATHERINGS.pdf)
        
        - `Following the speeches, those who had joined the event virtually left the meeting. Several of those in the room also left at this point, some others remained for a period of around 45 minutes before heading home or returning to their offices to work. A small number of individuals (three or four) remained in the Pillared Room for a while longer and then went to the Private Office area, where they continued to drink alcohol until approximately 01.00.` [[p26/27]](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1078404/2022-05-25_FINAL_FINDINGS_OF_SECOND_PERMANENT_SECRETARY_INTO_ALLEGED_GATHERINGS.pdf)
        
    - 17 December 2020: A gathering in Cabinet Office, 70 Whitehall on the departure of a Senior Cabinet Office Official and a No 10 Official
        
        - `Kate Josephs and a No 10 official were leaving the Civil Service and wished to mark their departure with a formal leaving event. In the week before the event there was a discussion with the Second Permanent Secretary, James Bowler, about the planned event. He said that it could take place on the basis that it was time limited, that no one was to travel into the office specially and that it should be socially distanced. The Cabinet Office Covid Taskforce operated largely on a work from home basis with the exception of some key staff, mostly senior civil servants who attended the office in 70 Whitehall. On a typical day, there were approximately twelve members of staff present.` [[p27]](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1078404/2022-05-25_FINAL_FINDINGS_OF_SECOND_PERMANENT_SECRETARY_INTO_ALLEGED_GATHERINGS.pdf)
        
        - `The intention was to follow the social distancing guidance by observing a one way system, social distancing and other precautionary measures. This did not happen as those in the room gathered in small groups, and there was also mingling between groups. There was food and drink available, including crisps, beer and prosecco that had been purchased by individuals attending. Background music was played through a smartphone.` ... `At 22.44, an individual ordered six pizzas for the group.` [[p28]](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1078404/2022-05-25_FINAL_FINDINGS_OF_SECOND_PERMANENT_SECRETARY_INTO_ALLEGED_GATHERINGS.pdf)
        
    - 18 December 2020: A gathering in No 10 Downing Street ahead of the Christmas break
        
        - `The investigation was told that members of the Press Office have, for some time (including before the pandemic), brought in wine on Fridays to mark the end of the week. This was known as ‘Wine Time Friday’ where bottles of wine were placed on a table in a small room adjacent to the main Press Office and people could help themselves.` [[p29]](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1078404/2022-05-25_FINAL_FINDINGS_OF_SECOND_PERMANENT_SECRETARY_INTO_ALLEGED_GATHERINGS.pdf)
        
        - `On 27 November 2020, a message was sent at 15.31 by a No 10 official on a WhatsApp Group consisting of No 10 media special advisers and members of the No 10 Press Office and Private Office. The message read ‘Hey team - do you want to participate in press office secret Santa?’, followed by a message saying ‘Spending limit £10’ and a further message which read ‘We will do gift exchange and cheese and (lots of) wine on 18th Dec.’ A number of staff replied positively. On 3 December 2020, an email invitation was sent from the Press Office Mailbox to members of the No 10 Press Office, which included officials and special advisers, inviting them to a ‘Wine & Cheese Evening’, to be held from 17.00-21.00 on Friday 18 December 2020. On 7 December 2020, messages were sent via a second WhatsApp group organising who would provide which type of cheese for the event.` [[p30]](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1078404/2022-05-25_FINAL_FINDINGS_OF_SECOND_PERMANENT_SECRETARY_INTO_ALLEGED_GATHERINGS.pdf)
        
        - `On the 18 December 2020 at 13.19, the email invitation of 3 December 2020 was reissued.

        - `At approximately 19.45 that evening, a panic alarm button was accidentally triggered by a member of staff. The custodians on duty responded, as did one of the police officers on No 10 door duty. They observed a large number of people in the area outside of the main Press Office and one individual giving a speech. Inside the Press Office a further 15-20 people were present.` [[p31]](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1078404/2022-05-25_FINAL_FINDINGS_OF_SECOND_PERMANENT_SECRETARY_INTO_ALLEGED_GATHERINGS.pdf)
        
        - `There was food and alcohol available which had been bought and brought in by staff. Some members of staff drank excessively. The event was crowded and noisy such that some people working elsewhere in the No 10 building that evening heard significant levels of noise coming from what they characterised as a ‘party’ in the Press Office. A cleaner who attended the room the next morning noted that there had been red wine spilled on one wall and on a number of boxes of photocopier paper.` [[p31/32]](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1078404/2022-05-25_FINAL_FINDINGS_OF_SECOND_PERMANENT_SECRETARY_INTO_ALLEGED_GATHERINGS.pdf)

The email contained only a Microsoft Teams online link; no information was initially given to suggest an in-person event. This email was subsequently forwarded to approximately 40 people across No 10, the Cabinet Office and HM Treasury. There was a link provided in the invitation for those attending virtually.` [[p32/33]](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1078404/2022-05-25_FINAL_FINDINGS_OF_SECOND_PERMANENT_SECRETARY_INTO_ALLEGED_GATHERINGS.pdf)
        
        - `The event began at around 18.00 on 14 January 2021 in the Pillared Room, one of the larger rooms in No 10. Approximately 15 members of staff from the No 10 Private Office and No 10 Policy Unit attended in person, with up to 30 people joining virtually. The Prime Minister attended at approximately 18.00 for around ten minutes in between meetings. He gave a short speech thanking those leaving before retuming to his office. There were further speeches by other members of No 10 staff. There are photographs of the event. Following the speeches while some people left, others remained in the Pillared Room and continued to chat and drink. It is unclear what time the event finished. We were informed at least some of those present were there beyond 23.00.` [[p33]](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1078404/2022-05-25_FINAL_FINDINGS_OF_SECOND_PERMANENT_SECRETARY_INTO_ALLEGED_GATHERINGS.pdf)

        - `The Digital team is part of the No 10 Press Office team and there was considerable overlap in attendance at the two events. The first, for James Slack, began at approximately 18.30, with speeches in the Press Office. He wished to thank his team members individually and to set out future direction for the team. It lasted for around an hour and there were approximately 45 people in total in attendance both in the office and with a small number online. Those present in person came from across No 10, including senior officials. Some joined the event virtually. Wine and beer had been bought by staff and was consumed by some during the speeches.` [[p34]](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1078404/2022-05-25_FINAL_FINDINGS_OF_SECOND_PERMANENT_SECRETARY_INTO_ALLEGED_GATHERINGS.pdf)
        
        - `Following the speeches, some staff returned to work but others continued chatting and drinking. They remained for some time and were present when the building was being locked down for the evening. Those still present were asked to leave the building by a No 10 custodian. The group then moved into the No 10 garden.` [[p34/35]](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1078404/2022-05-25_FINAL_FINDINGS_OF_SECOND_PERMANENT_SECRETARY_INTO_ALLEGED_GATHERINGS.pdf)
        
        - `The second event, for the other No 10 official, was held in the offices of the Digital Team in the basement of No 10. It began at approximately the same time as the event for the Director of Communications, at around 18.00, but was smaller in scale, with 15-20 people present, including a special adviser and more junior officials. There were leaving speeches and a presentation. Wine was available and music was played from a laptop on top of a printer. A number of those present drank excessively.` [[p35]](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1078404/2022-05-25_FINAL_FINDINGS_OF_SECOND_PERMANENT_SECRETARY_INTO_ALLEGED_GATHERINGS.pdf)
        
        - `There was mingling between the two events, with some staff moving up and down the stairs in between the basement and the Press Office. The two groups eventually joined together in the Downing Street garden. Shortly before 21.30, there were over 20 people present in the garden, with a number of bottles of alcohol. A number of individuals gathered near a child’s swing/slide in the garden, damaging it by leaning on and playing with it. This was noticed the next morning and reported to No 10 staff.

        - `The No 10 entry logs show that a number of people left No 10 at this point. They were encouraged by the custodian to use the rear exit of No 10. Some individuals remained in the building and carried on drinking alcohol until the early hours. Exit logs indicate that some left after midnight and others between 01.45-02.45. Two members of staff stayed later still, with one leaving at 03.11 and the last leaving at 04:20.` [[p35]](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1078404/2022-05-25_FINAL_FINDINGS_OF_SECOND_PERMANENT_SECRETARY_INTO_ALLEGED_GATHERINGS.pdf)
        
    - Conclusions of the Report
        
        - `Whatever the initial intent, what took place at many of these gatherings and the way in which they developed was not in line with Covid guidance at the time. Even allowing for the extraordinary pressures officials and advisers were under, the factual findings of this report illustrate some attitudes and behaviours inconsistent with that guidance. It is also clear, from the outcome of the police investigation, that a large number of individuals (83) who attended these events breached Covid regulations and therefore Covid guidance.` [[p36]](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1078404/2022-05-25_FINAL_FINDINGS_OF_SECOND_PERMANENT_SECRETARY_INTO_ALLEGED_GATHERINGS.pdf)
        
        - `The events that I investigated were attended by leaders in government. Many of these events should not have been allowed to happen. It is also the case that some of the more junior civil servants believed that their involvement in some of these events was permitted given the attendance of senior leaders. The senior leadership at the centre, both political and official, must bear responsibility for this culture.` [[p36]](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1078404/2022-05-25_FINAL_FINDINGS_OF_SECOND_PERMANENT_SECRETARY_INTO_ALLEGED_GATHERINGS.pdf)
        
        - `I found that some staff had witnessed or been subjected to behaviours at work which they had felt concerned about but at times felt unable to raise properly. I was made aware of multiple examples of a lack of respect and poor treatment of security and cleaning staff. This was unacceptable.` [[p36]](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1078404/2022-05-25_FINAL_FINDINGS_OF_SECOND_PERMANENT_SECRETARY_INTO_ALLEGED_GATHERINGS.pdf)
        
        - `The public have a right to expect the very highest standards of behaviour in such places and clearly what happened fell well short of this.` [[p37]](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1078404/2022-05-25_FINAL_FINDINGS_OF_SECOND_PERMANENT_SECRETARY_INTO_ALLEGED_GATHERINGS.pdf)
        
### 2022 Lord Geidt’s Reaction
- On 31 May 2022, Lord Geidt, the Government's independent adviser on ministers' interests, published his annual report.
    
    - `In the case of the Fixed Penalty Notice recently issued to and paid by the Prime Minister, a legitimate question has arisen as to whether those facts alone might have constituted a breach of the overarching duty within the Ministerial Code of complying with the law. It may be that the Prime Minister considers that no such breach of his Ministerial Code has occurred. In that case, I believe a Prime Minister should respond accordingly, setting out his case in public.  
    -   
    - Such a circular process could only risk placing the Ministerial Code in a place of ridicule. Instead, and since the point when the inquiries by the Cabinet Secretary (later conducted by the Second Permanent Secretary) and the Metropolitan Police were embarked upon, I have repeatedly counselled the Prime Minister’s official and political advisers that the Prime Minister should be ready to offer public comment on his obligations under the Ministerial Code, even if he has judged himself not to be in breach. This has been my standing advice, which I was assured had been conveyed to the Prime Minister. Its purpose has simply been to ensure that the Prime Minister should publicly be seen to take responsibility for his own conduct under his own Ministerial Code. That advice has not been heeded and, in relation to the allegations about unlawful gatherings in Downing Street, the Prime Minister has made not a single public reference to the Ministerial Code.`  
    - [link](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1080213/independent-adviser-annual-report.pdf)
    
- On 31 May 2022, As requested by Lord Geidt, Johnson then made his case to Lord Geidt public in which he blamed a possible failure of communication between Johnson and Lord Geidt, that Johnson had taken full responsibility and stated that the fixed penalty notice was not a criminal conviction.
    
    - `When we spoke earlier today, you confirmed that you had not raised with me directly your advice to make a public comment, nor were you asking me to adjudicate on the Ministerial Code. Notwithstanding, I understand your frustration that there may have been a failure of communication between our offices, such that I was not aware of the weight you put on the absence of an explicit reference to the Ministerial Code.  
    -   
    - ...  
    -   
    - As you know, I have previously sought your independent advice, and acted upon it, in order to ensure that my responsibilities under the Code were properly discharged. Turning to recent events, I have taken full responsibility for everything that took place on my watch, and reiterate my apology to the House and to the whole country in respect of the gathering on 19 June in the Cabinet Room for which I received a fixed penalty notice.  
    -   
    - I have also been clear that there was no intent to break the regulations; at the time I did not consider that the circumstances in which I received a fixed penalty notice were contrary to the regulations. I have accepted the outcome and paid it in compliance with legal requirements. Paying a fixed penalty notice is not a criminal conviction. I have corrected the record in Parliament, where it transpired that the information I previously conveyed in good faith was not ultimately correct: this correction to Parliament is in line with the Ministerial Code.`

### 2023 Johnson Resigns as Member of Parliament
- On 9 June 2023, after receiving a confidential report from the Privileges Committee of the House of Commons that was looking into whether he had intentionally misled Parliament over lockdown-breaking parties in Downing Street during the COVID-19 pandemic, Johnson announced his resignation as MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip, triggering a by-election.
    
    - `Boris Johnson has announced he is standing down as an MP with immediate effect after receiving the report into whether he lied to MPs over partygate.  
    -   
    - In an excoriating statement, the former prime minister said a letter from the privileges committee made clear "that they are determined to use the proceedings against me to drive me out of parliament".  
    -   
    - As a result, Mr Johnson said: "I have written to my association in Uxbridge and South Ruislip to say that I am stepping down forthwith and triggering an immediate by-election.  
    -   
    - "I am very sorry to leave my wonderful constituency. It has been a huge honour to serve them, both as Mayor and MP."`

### 2023 Privileges Committee Report on Johnson
- On 15 June 2023, The House of Commons Committee of Privileges released a report on `Matter referred on 21 April 2022 (conduct of Rt Hon Boris Johnson): Final Report`.
    
    - `Using the categories of misleading set out in paragraph 32 of the Fourth Report, we conclude that:  
    -   
    - a) Mr Johnson misled the House when he said on 1 December 2021 that all Guidance was followed completely in No. 10, when he said on 8 December 2021 that the Rules and Guidance were followed at all times, on 12 January 2022 when he said that events at No. 10 were within the Rules and Guidance, and on 25 May 2022 when he said that the Rules and Guidance had been followed at all times when he was present at gatherings to wish staff farewell. See paragraph 117.  
    -   
    - b) Mr Johnson misled the House when he failed to tell the House about his own knowledge of the gatherings where the Rules or Guidance had been broken. See paragraphs 23 to 94.  
    -   
    - c) Mr Johnson misled the House when he said on 8 December 2021 that he relied upon repeated assurances that the rules had not been broken. There is evidence that Mr Johnson was assured by two individuals who had worked at No. 10 at the time that they did not think the gathering of 18 December 2020 had broken Covid rules–see paragraphs 136 to 144, and 176. However, we conclude that:  
    -   
    - i) Mr Johnson had personal knowledge about gatherings which he should have disclosed. See paragraphs 23 to 94.  
    -   
    - ii) Mr Johnson concedes that there was no assurance about any gathering’s compliance with the guidance that was in place at the time (as opposed to compliance with the Covid rules), yet Mr Johnson gave the House the impression that those assurances had been overarching and comprehensive in respect of No. 10’s compliance with all Covid measures. See paragraphs 144, 146, 161, and 180 to 183.  
    -   
    - iii) The purported assurances were only about the gathering of 18 December 2020, not more generally about No. 10’s compliance with the Rules and Guidance, yet Mr Johnson gave the House the impression that those assurances had been overarching and comprehensive in respect of No. 10’s compliance with Covid measures across the whole period of restrictions. In particular, we have received no evidence that any specific assurance was provided in relation to the gatherings of 20 May 2020, 19 June 2020, 13 November 2020, 27 November 2020 and 14 January 2021 which we have examined in detail. See paragraphs 145, and 180 to 183.  
    -   
    - iv) The context for the initial purported assurance was in response to a media inquiry and the assertion that Covid rules were followed was initially developed in haste, and without further investigation, as a media line to take. They were therefore not appropriate for Mr Johnson to cite as an authoritative indication of No. 10’s compliance with Covid measures. See paragraphs 137 to 141.  
    -   
    - The only two purported assurances for which there is firm evidence did not emanate from senior permanent civil servants or government lawyers but from two media advisers, one of whom was a personal political appointment by Mr Johnson. The purported assurances consisted only of what those individuals themselves believed about the compliance of the gathering of 18 December 2020 with the Rules. They were therefore not appropriate to be cited as an authoritative indication of No. 10’s compliance with Covid measures. See paragraphs 139 to 144, 163 to 165, and 176 to 178.  
    -   
    - d) Mr Johnson misled the House when he gave the impression that there needed to be an investigation by the Second Permanent Secretary to establish whether the rules and guidance had been broken before he could answer questions to the House. While repeatedly making that statement to the House, he had personal knowledge that he did not reveal. See paragraphs 23 to 94, and 127.  
    -   
    - e) We additionally find that Mr Johnson misled the House when he purported to correct the record on 25 May 2022. We have concluded above that his statement on that date that the Covid Rules and Guidance were followed while he was in attendance at farewell gatherings at No. 10 was misleading. As such, it represented a continuation of his previous misleading of the House, and seeking to present it as a correction was itself misleading. His insistence on the truthfulness of this statement in his written evidence, and his refusal to correct the record when invited to do so during his oral evidence on 22 March 2023, is a further misleading. See paragraphs 131 and 187.  
    -   
    - 189. We further conclude that Mr Johnson has been disingenuous with the Committee in ways which amount to misleading, as follows:  
    -   
    - a) By adopting a narrow and restricted interpretation of the assertions he gave to the House in PMQs on 1 and 8 December 2021 which is at odds with the general impression he clearly wished to give in the House that all Rules and Guidance at No. 10 had been followed at all times. See paragraphs 180 to 183.  
    -   
    - b) By claiming that when he referred to having been repeatedly assured, by “repeatedly” he had meant merely “on more than one occasion”. We note that this is contrary to common English usage. It is clear that when Mr Johnson used the term “repeatedly” at PMQs, he wished his audience to suppose that there had been multiple occasions at which assurances had been given, rather than merely more than one, and, as suggested by our evidence, possibly as few as two. See paragraph 134.  
    -   
    - c) By undertaking to provide the Committee with the name of another person who had provided assurances, and then failing to do so. See paragraphs 167 to 169.  
    -   
    - d) By stating at the oral evidence session that the Committee had withheld from publication “the evidence that I rely on, which answers the charges” and “a large number of extracts which I rely upon in my defence”, but then, when the Committee had facilitated the production of that evidence accompanied by statements of truth, failing to make any use of it in his subsequent final submission. This strongly suggests that Mr Johnson did not “rely on” the evidence at all but was simply using it as a gambit to criticise the Committee in the public hearing. See paragraph 220.  
    -   
    - e) By advancing an unsustainable interpretation of Guidance in order that he can deny the implications of the evidence showing a lack of social distancing. See paragraphs 99 to 102, and 115 to 116.  
    -   
    - f) By being unable to deny that he said the words “probably the most unsocially distanced gathering in the UK right now” while not admitting that he said them, which has the ring of avoidance about it. See paragraphs 68 to 69.`
