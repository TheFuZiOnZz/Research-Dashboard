- On 30 June 2016, Shami Chakrabarti’s inquiry presented its findings stating that although antisemitism and other types of racism were not endemic within Labour.
    
    - `my key recommendations are as follows:  
    -   
    - 1. Epithets such as "Paki", "Zio" and others should have no place in Labour Party discourse going forward.  
    -   
    - 2. Critical and abusive reference to any particular person or group based on actual or perceived physical characteristics cannot be tolerated.  
    -   
    - 3. Racial or religious tropes and stereotypes about any group of people should have no place in our modern Labour Party.  
    -   
    - 4. Labour members should resist the use of Hitler, Nazi and Holocaust metaphors, distortions and comparisons in debates about Israel-Palestine in particular.  
    -   
    - 5. Excuse for, denial, approval or minimisation of the Holocaust and attempts to blur responsibility for it have no place in the Labour Party.  
    -   
    - 6. Beliefs out-with the Labour Party's values are not to be protected when considering whether a member has acted in a way which is prejudicial or grossly detrimental to the party.  
    -   
    - 7. The Code of Conduct approved in May 2016 should be amended so as to comprehensively rule out all forms of prejudice, but in the light of this and the guidance in my Report, I do not find other substantive (as opposed to procedural) rule changes to be strictly necessary.  
    -   
    - 8. I recommend procedural rule changes (a draft is annexed to this Report) to improve the Party's disciplinary process (as well as a wider review of the relevant provisions of the rules and procedural guidelines in the light of those recommendations) and the adoption and publication of a complaints procedure.  
    -   
    - 9. I recommend the appointment of a General Counsel to the Labour Party and additional and appropriately expert staff.  
    -   
    - 10. I recommend that the power of interim suspension be vested in the NCC and give guidance as to how it might be exercised more proportionately.  
    -   
    - 11. I recommend the appointment of a Legal Panel of volunteer lawyers of standing so as to assist the NCC in its functions and to provide a review on procedural and proportionality grounds in cases of suspension or expulsion from the Party.  
    -   
    - 12. I recommend consideration of a greater range of NCC sanctions short of suspension and expulsion.  
    -   
    - 13. I do not recommend lifetime bans from the Labour Party and recommend time limits on the bringing of disciplinary charges.  
    -   
    - 14. Once my Report is disseminated and so as to give members an opportunity to be guided by it, I recommend a moratorium on triggering new investigations into matters of relevant language and conduct arising before publication. This in no way effects investigations and disciplinary proceedings already in train.  
    -   
    - 15. I recommend the formation of an NEC working group into comprehensive education and training needs across the Party with a view to partnership with Trade Unions and Higher Education providers. Staff and members involved in the new disciplinary process should receive appropriate training.  
    -   
    - 16. I recommend a review of the Party's Equal Opportunities Policies with a view to adopting an over-arching Equal Opportunities Policy.  
    -   
    - 17. I recommend better dissemination and explanation of the Party's Rule Book.  
    -   
    - 18. I recommend that the NEC gives urgent attention to any parts of the country that have been under "special measures" for more than six months.  
    -   
    - 19. I recommend that no part of the Party should be subject to "special measures" for more than six months without NEC review of that decision. Further the NEC must provide a plan as to how the local party is to improve its practice and return to full democratic rights within the Party.

    - `Finally, the following findings should be emphasised:  
    -   
    - 1. There is no evidence that, at any point in GLU’s history, antisemitism complaints were treated differently to any other complaints – the problems outlined affected all complaints about whatsoever subject. Whilst the \#MeToo movement and allegations concerning MPs involved in sexual harassment led to a new specifically-tailored process for such complaints, a new specific process was then introduced for antisemitism complaints too.  
    -   
    - 2. There is also no evidence that any individual working for the Labour Party, former or current, has been motivated by antisemitic intent, nor that any complaints were ever treated less favourably because they came from a Jewish complainant or were concerned with allegations of antisemitism.  
    -   
    - 3. There is evidence that the lack of robust processes, systems, training, education and effective line management had a significant impact upon the thorough, consistent and expedient handling of all complaints. There is also evidence that there was previously much larger scope for human error, without safeguards in place to allow for correction of them.  
    -   
    - 4. The evidence demonstrates that, particularly from spring 2018 onwards, the Party has introduced appropriate processes, systems, training, education and effective line management to ensure antisemitism complaints are dealt with swiftly and robustly. These safeguards ensure that the past mistakes in the handling of antisemitism complaints cannot be repeated now.  
    -   
    - We believe this report demonstrates an unprecedented level of openness, honesty and transparency in confronting our own past shortcomings. Our overriding objective regardless of anything else is to eradicate the virus of antisemitism from our Party and make our Party a safe and welcoming home for Jewish members.`
