### 2021- Cost of Living Crisis
### 2022 Council Tax Rebate
- On 3 February 2022, Sunak announced that:
    
    - `Households in England, which are in council tax bands A-D, will also receive a £150 rebate. The rebate to bills will be made directly by local authorities from April. This will not need to be repaid.` [link](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/millions-to-receive-350-boost-to-help-with-rising-energy-costs)
    
- On 18 May 2022, Rachel Reeves, Labour’s Shadow Chancellor said:
    
    - `The action that Labour proposes is a windfall tax to take up to £600 off people’s bills. As the hon. Lady knows, energy bills have gone up 54%, by an average of £693. With all respect, £150 just does not cut it.` [link](https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2022-05-18/debates/27E5BBC2-C573-45B8-891B-F1CFF1C3E977/AchievingEconomicGrowth?highlight=windfall%20tax\#contribution-972E0255-C4AA-4868-B90E-3D64FD73D7C6)
    
  
- In 24 February 2022, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation made a short report, which included:
    
    - `The mitigations consisting of the council tax rebate and rebate loan then claw-back will cover only 60% of the increase for the average low-income family, highlighting the risk of widespread hardship if further action is not taken.` [link](https://www.jrf.org.uk/press/400000-people-could-be-pulled-poverty-real-terms-cut-benefits-april)
    
- In March 2022, the Office for Budget Responsibility released a `Economic and fiscal outlook` report, which included:
    
    - `Non-labour income growth remains relatively strong, boosted by the council tax and energy bills rebates announced in February. But with the consumption deflator rising by 5.5 per cent, the net result is an annual fall in real household disposable income of 1.5 per cent, the largest since the 1.8 percent fall in 2011.` [link](https://obr.uk//docs/dlm_uploads/CCS0222366764-001_OBR-EFO-March-2022_Web-Accessible-2.pdf)
    
- On 9 March 2022, the New Economics Foundation found that:
    
    - `Our analysis shows that, come April, and after taking account of the full suite of policy changes — including national insurance, benefit increases and higher national minimum wage — the council tax rebate will still see the poorest families lose the largest proportion of their disposable incomes to higher energy bills (figure 2 below). The lowest income 10% of families will be around £420 worse off in annual terms, or 2.5% of disposable incomes.` [link](https://neweconomics.org/2022/03/cold-homes-this-april)
    
- On 27 May 2022, the Resolution Foundation gave a response to the cost of living support package, they found that:
    
    - `more universalist support (through Council Tax rebates or energy bills) falls away in 2023-24, meaning that fiscal policy is (rightly) only trying to delay rather than prevent the impact of rising energy bills for better-off households (the energy price cap itself serves a similar function, delaying the feed through of rising wholesale prices on retail energy prices).` [link](https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/publications/back-on-target/)
    
### 2022 Energy Profits Levy Funding Cost of Living Support Package
- On 9 January 2022, A Windfall tax was originally proposed by labour.
    
    - `Labour would impose a windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas producers to fund measures to ease the cost of living squeeze, by reducing the average household energy bill by £200. The £6.6bn plan would include removing VAT on domestic energy bills for a whole year, as well as expanding and increasing the warm homes discount for those most at risk.` [link](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/08/labour-proposes-windfall-tax-on-north-sea-oil-and-gas-to-reduce-bills)
    
- Sunak originally didn't want to implement a windfall tax as he said it would deter investment.
    
    - `In an interview with Mumsnet, Rishi Sunak says that if oil and gas companies do not ramp up investment then he will consider a windfall tax. His argument has been that tax would deter investment, but the idea is popular and doing very well for Labour.` [link](https://www.itv.com/news/2022-04-27/will-rishi-sunak-impose-a-windfall-tax-on-oil-companies-in-face-of-rising-costs)
    
- On 30 March 2022, Starmer during Prime Ministers Questions said:
    
    - `All of this while oil and gas companies see unexpected bumper profits. A windfall tax would raise billions and ease the burden on working people. The former chief executive office of BP, Lord John Browne, says a windfall tax is “justifiable”. The current CEO says that BP has, in his words, “more cash than we know what to do with.” Why is the Prime Minister more interested in shielding oil and gas profits than supporting working people?` [link](https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2022-03-30/debates/F96C3BEA-0E6F-4B74-B53F-E6DF2A9FCF8B/Engagements?highlight=windfall%20tax\#contribution-D6058C5A-BCC6-4ECD-A495-39BD390F9E2D)
    
- On 19 April 2022, During a Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee on Energy pricing and the future of the Energy Market, Keith Anderson, CEO of Scottish Power said:
    
    - `I think Ofgem now fully understand the issues that we all face and that customers are facing, as well as some of the changes we need to bring through the system. ... but the one thing that Ofgem cannot fix on their own and that requires Government help and policy is people’s ability to pay. That, to me, is the biggest issue we face, outstripping everything else 10 times over. There are a lot of people out there who will not be able to pay their bill and who will struggle, and Ofgem do not have the powers to deal with that on their own. The industry does not have the power and the strength to deal with it all on its own. It requires a Government intervention.` [link](https://committees.parliament.uk/oralevidence/10102/default/)
    
- On 18 May 2022, Starmer during Prime Ministers Questions said:
    
    - `Clearly, he just cannot make his mind up, so let us have a look at who is for this and who is against it. On one side, we have the chair of Tesco; the chair of John Lewis; the Chair of the Treasury Committee; the Chair of the Education Committee; Lord Hague; and Lord Browne, the old chief executive officer of BP. They all support a windfall tax. Even the current boss of BP says a windfall tax would not discourage investment.` [link](https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2022-05-18/debates/9871FD7A-2BEA-4C79-B5AF-AC681EB598D6/Engagements\#contribution-E6254078-85FA-4561-BD5E-77859DDE5D4D)
    
- On 18 May 2022, Rachel Reeves, Labour’s Shadow Chancellor said:
    
    - `The action that Labour proposes is a windfall tax to take up to £600 off people’s bills. As the hon. Lady knows, energy bills have gone up 54%, by an average of £693. With all respect, £150 just does not cut it.  
    -   
    - Labour first proposed a windfall tax on 9 January, more than four months ago, and what was the first response from a Conservative Minister? It was to insist that a windfall tax would be unfair because Shell and BP were “struggling”. North sea oil and gas producers are making £32 million a day in unexpected profits. Meanwhile, parents trying to pay their bills are going without food so that their children do not miss meals—that is struggling. We now know that each and every day the Conservatives delay introducing a windfall tax, families and pensioners are forking out £53 million more in their energy bills.`  
    -   
    - ...  
    -   
    - `The Government got rid of the triple lock, and now they are refusing to implement a windfall tax. Every day, the case for Labour’s windfall tax gets stronger, while the Tory defence for refusing to act gets weaker and weaker, yet last night every single Conservative MP voted against a windfall tax for the third time. People can no longer afford to pay for the Government’s mistakes. The Government should put the national interest first and follow Labour’s advice. It is time to do the right thing; it is time to put the needs of people first; it is time to introduce a windfall tax to get bills down.`

- On 26 May 2022, After the release of the [[United Kingdom Contents Page]], Chancellor Rishi Sunak confirms U-turn on windfall tax to aid in the Cost of living crisis.
    
    - `The government has U-turned on its opposition to a windfall tax on oil and gas firms, announcing it will introduce a levy to help tackle rising bills. Ministers had rejected the idea - put forward by opposition parties - that would see a one-off charge imposed on the company's record profits. But Chancellor Rishi Sunak said his levy would "tax extraordinary profits fairly and incentivise investments". Labour's Rachel Reeves said Mr Sunak had "finally come to his senses". The chancellor said new tax would raise £5bn over the course of the next year, allowing the government to "help families with the cost of living", while avoiding "having to increase our debt burden further". He added: "There is nothing noble in burdening future generations with ever more debt today because politicians of the day were too weak to make the tough decisions."` [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-61590957)
    
    - Rishi: `So, like previous Governments, including Conservative ones, we will introduce a temporary targeted energy profits levy, But we have built into the new levy, We have built into the new levy a new investment allowance similar to the super deduction, which means that companies will have a new and significant incentive to reinvest their profits. The new levy will be charged on the profits of oil and gas companies at a rate of 25%. It will be temporary, and when oil and gas prices return to historically more normal levels, the levy will be phased out, with a sunset clause written into the legislation. And crucially, with our new investment allowance, we are nearly doubling the overall investment relief for oil and gas companies. That means that for every pound a company invests, it will get back 90% in tax relief. So the more a company invests, the less tax it will pay.` [link](https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2022-05-26/debates/00D0B309-467C-44F6-BC45-74E1EBA205B4/EconomyUpdate?highlight=cost%20living\#contribution-FEAB7B94-82EB-4045-9D9A-4A99769D215D)
    
    - Rachel Reeves, Labour’s Shadow Chancellor: `After today’s announcement, let there be no doubt about who is winning the battle of ideas in Britain—it is the Labour party. Today, it feels as though the Chancellor has finally realised the problems the country is facing. We first called for a windfall tax on oil and gas producers nearly five months ago, to help struggling families and pensioners. Today, he has announced that policy but he dare not say the words; it is a policy that dare not speak its name for this Chancellor. It was also Labour that first highlighted the unfairness of this Government’s buy now, pay later compulsory loan scheme. It should not have taken a rocket scientist to work out that this would not cut it, and we pointed that out at the time, but that is the mark of this Klarna Chancellor: announce now, ditch later. Here he is, once again, the Treasury’s one-man rebuttal unit, the Chancellor himself.` [link](https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2022-05-26/debates/00D0B309-467C-44F6-BC45-74E1EBA205B4/EconomyUpdate?highlight=windfall%20tax\#contribution-3330264F-1D19-436F-A1F6-2B0F06A35E4C)
    
- On 26 May 2022, support had been broadly welcomed by the energy sector, following months of cautions and calls for action from Sunak.
    
    - `“The huge increase in energy prices we’ve seen as a result of the fossil fuel crisis is unmanageable for many. So we are glad that the government is boosting its energy bill support to reduce the impact on consumers,” said Greg Jackson, CEO and founder of Octopus Energy.`  
    -   
    - `"This is a very significant package from the Government and we entirely support it,” said Stephen Fitzpatrick, founder of OVO of the newest support measures. “No scheme is perfect but this intervention will support millions of British families that need help the most. With the Treasury providing this financial support to customers, it is now up to OVO and other energy companies to work together with the Government and Ofgem to ensure that customers get the help they need to stay warm this winter.”`

- On 26 May 2022, the Institute for Fiscal Studies gave a response to the cost of living support package, they found that:
    
    - `The new energy profits levy of 25% – much higher than the 10% Labour had proposed – takes the overall tax rate on North Sea oil and gas profits from 40% to 65% from now until December 2025 (or sooner ‘if oil and gas prices return to historically more normal levels’). That is a much higher rate than is paid by onshore companies, but broadly typical of the historical rates of North Sea taxation since the 1970s. Far from this tax rise discouraging investment in the North Sea, a new ‘super-deduction’ means that North Sea investment will be massively subsidised while the higher tax rate is in place.  
    -   
    - Stuart Adam, a Senior Economist at the IFS, said:  
    -   
    - “The new super-deduction means that investing £100 in the North Sea will cost companies only £8.75, with the remaining cost paid by the government. So a massively loss-making investment could still be profitable after tax. It is hard to see why the government should provide such huge tax subsidies and thereby incentivise even economically unviable projects.”`

- On 27 May 2022, the Resolution Foundation gave a response to the cost of living support package, they found that:
    
    - `Yesterday’s response was a major package of support for household living costs, nearly doubling the help that had been announced this Spring. Alongside its scale, the defining feature of the support announced is that it is well targeted – filling the big gap left by the Chancellor’s previous announcements’ failure to provide sufficient support for those on lower incomes who are worst affected by surging energy bills. The winter ahead will be a long way from easy for poorer households, but it will be a lot less grim as a result of yesterday’s package.` [link](https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/publications/back-on-target/)
    
  
- On 5 August 2022, the Office for National Statistics [link](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/wellbeing/bulletins/publicopinionsandsocialtrendsgreatbritain/20to31july2022) released a statistical bulletin that found:
    
    - `The following information is on the latest period, 20 to 31 July 2022, based on adults in Great Britain.  
    -   
    - Around 9 in 10 (89%) adults reported their cost of living had risen over the past month; this is the same as the previous period (6 to 17 July) but an increase since we first started asking this question in the period 3 to 14 November 2021 (62%).  
    -   
    - Three-quarters (75%) of adults reported being very or somewhat worried about rising costs of living in the last two weeks; this estimate has remained relatively stable since we first started asking this question in the period 27 April to 8 May 2022.  
    -   
    - Over 4 in 10 (44%) adults who pay energy bills found it very or somewhat difficult to afford them, compared with 46% in the previous period.  
    -   
    - Around 1 in 5 (19%) working adults neither travelled to work nor worked from home, an increase from 15% in the previous period; this could be explained by more working adults taking annual leave during the summer holidays.`  
    
    - `In this period, we continued to ask adults about changes to their cost of living over the past month, with around 9 in 10 (89%) reporting it had increased in the latest period (the same as in the previous period). This is a rise from 62% when we first asked about this in the period 3 to 14 November 2021.  
    -   
    - Reasons reported by adults for the rise in their cost of living were an increase in:  
    -   
    - the price of food shopping (94%, the same as in the previous period)  
    - gas or electricity bills (82%, compared with 81% in the previous period)  
    - the price of fuel (77%, compared with 75% in the previous period)  
    -   
    - Of all adults, three-quarters (75%) reported being very or somewhat worried about rising costs of living in the last two weeks; this estimate has remained relatively stable since we first asked this question in the period 27 April to 8 May 2022.`  
    

2022 OBR’s `Fiscal Risks and Sustainability` Report
- On July 2022, the Office for Budget Responsibility released a `Fiscal risks and sustainability` report, [link](https://obr.uk//docs/dlm_uploads/Fiscal_risks_and_sustainability_2022-1.pdf) which included:
    
    - `The pandemic has had remarkably little impact on the medium-term fiscal position (with debt marginally higher but the primary balance slightly stronger), thanks in part to the substantial tax rises announced in its wake. Since our 2018 FSR, demographic pressures have eased somewhat in the nearterm thanks to a lower birth rate and slower improvements in life expectancy, reducing age-related spending as a share of GDP, while lower migration levels bring some fiscal offsets. But in the long run the pressures of an aging population on spending and the loss of existing motoring taxes in a decarbonising economy leaves public debt on an unsustainable path in the long term.`
    
    - `These emergent geopolitical and energy risks, and all of those analysed in our previous FRRs, need to be managed in the context of a set of longer-term demographic, environmental, and other structural pressures on the public finances. These are the largest, and most certain, threats to long-term fiscal sustainability – with every assessment we have published over the past decade having shown debt on an unsustainable path over the next 50 years as a result of these pressures. We have made only modest changes to the main demographic and economic assumptions underpinning our latest long-term projections, but some have significant fiscal implications`
    
    - `The continuously rising primary deficit means that net debt increases from 84 per cent of GDP in 2026-27 to 100 per cent in 2052-53 and then rises rapidly to 267 per cent of GDP by 2071-72. Despite this unsustainable path, this is 20 per cent of GDP lower than in our 2018 FSR projections. This partly reflects the improved starting primary deficit, as well as the more favourable interest rates relative to economic growth (‘R-G’) at the end of our latest medium-term horizon. Despite increasing the primary deficit by 2071-72, the cumulative effect of revised demographics across the projection period is to reduce debt as the more favourable near-term position outweighs the less favourable one in the longer term. These sources of downward revision are largely offset by the removal of net zero affected taxes.`
    
    - `These projections are not intended to provide a forecast of the actual evolution of revenue or spending. Rather they show what would happen if policy were unchanged and if our other conditioning assumptions also held true – most importantly that spending pressures are accommodated. If the projections suggest that the public finances are on an unsustainable path, and that were indeed to prove to be the case in practice, then one might expect a future government  
    - to take corrective action at some point.`  
    
    - `The combination of the primary balance and financial transactions projections set out above would leave public sector net debt and net interest spending on an unsustainable upward path over the long term (Table 4.11 and Chart 4.13 below). Up to the 2040s, net debt declines slowly reflecting relatively small primary deficits and relatively favourable growth corrected interest rates (that result in low net interest spending).`
    
    - `In all cases the fiscal gap is negative, consistent with the unsustainable fiscal position over the long run. To get the debt-to-GDP ratio to 75 per cent in 2071-72 would require a permanent increase in taxes and/or cut in spending of 4.2 per cent of GDP (£104 billion in today’s terms) in 2027-28. Since it is very unlikely that a government would try to offset several decades’ worth of future demographic and other cost pressures via a single upfront adjustment, a more realistic alternative adjustment is illustrated via the ‘gradual progress’ variant, which would require a series of tax increases or spending cuts worth an additional 1.5 per cent of GDP (£37 billion in today’s terms) each decade. This tightening is additional to any other tightening already announced, such as the health and social care levy, and in addition to announcements that are expected to affect the public finances over a longer time horizon and that are included in our central projection, such as linking changes to the State Pension age to life expectancy.`
