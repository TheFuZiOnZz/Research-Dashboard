### 2022 Johnsonâ€™s PM Resignation
- On 7 July 2022, Boris Johnson then resigned as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.
    
    - Boris Johnson Speech: `It is clearly now the will of the parliamentary Conservative Party that there should be a new leader of that Party and therefore a new Prime Minister.  
    -   
    - I agree with Sir Graham Brady, chairman of our backbench of MPs, that the process of choosing that new leader should begin now and the timetable will be announced next week.  
    -   
    - ...  
    -   
    - The reason I have fought so hard in the last few days to continue to deliver that mandate in person was not just because I wanted to do so, but because I felt it was my job, my duty, my obligation to you, to continue to do what we promised in 2019.  
    -   
    - ...  
    -   
    - To that new leader, whoever he or she may be, I say: I will give you as much support as I can.  
    -   
    - And to you, the British public, I know that there will be many people who are relieved and perhaps quite a few who will also be disappointed. And I want you to know how sad I am to be giving up the best job in the world. But them's the breaks.`
