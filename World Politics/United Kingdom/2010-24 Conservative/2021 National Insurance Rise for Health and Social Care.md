### 2021 National Insurance Rise for Health and Social Care
- On 7 September 2021, Boris Johnson outlines new 1.25% health and social care tax to pay for reforms.
    
    > `Boris Johnson said it would raise £12bn a year, designed to tackle the health backlog caused by the Covid pandemic and to bolster social care. He accepted the tax broke a manifesto pledge, but said the "global pandemic was in no-one's manifesto".` [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-58476632)
    
    > `This measure provides for a temporary 1.25 percentage point increase to both the main and additional rates of Class 1, Class 1A, Class 1B and Class 4 National Insurance contributions for the 2022 to 2023 tax year and revenue raised will go directly to support the NHS and equivalent bodies across the UK. From April 2023 onwards, the National Insurance contributions rates will decrease back to 2021 to 2022 tax year levels and will be replaced by a new 1.25% Health and Social Care Levy where the revenue will be ringfenced to support UK health and social care bodies.` [link](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/health-and-social-care-levy/health-and-social-care-levy)
    
  
- A 2019 Manifesto commitment was:
    
    > `Extra funding for the NHS, with 50,000 more nurses and 50 million more GP surgery appointments a year.`  
    >   
    > ...  
    >   
    > `Everyone in the UK should have the peace of mind and confidence that come from world-class health care – and so this new One Nation Conservative Government is giving the NHS its biggest ever cash boost, with 20 hospital upgrades and 40 new hospitals, while delivering 50,000 more nurses and 6,000 more doctors and creating an extra 50 million general practice appointments a year.`  
    >   
    > ...  
    >   
    > `We will not raise the rate of income tax, VAT or National Insurance.`

- A 2021 review found that:
    
    > `The government might hope this settlement is the final word on health spending for this parliament. But under these new plans health spending will still grow by little more than inflation between 2023/24 and 2024/25` ... `In real terms then, this package means core spending power for local authorities increases by 3.0 per cent a year on average over the 2021 Spending Review period, if the funding ring-fenced for adult social care reform is included. Once this funding, which is tied to specific new responsibilities, is excluded then spending power increases by 1.8 per cent a year.` [link](https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/blog/2021/11/autumn-budget-and-spending-review-2021?utm_source=in_text&utm_medium=website&utm_term=thekingsfund)
    
- A 2022 analysis found that:
    
    > `Prior to the pandemic in February 2020 there were already 4.43 million people on a waiting list for care. At the beginning of the pandemic, the number of people joining the waiting list initially dropped, but this has since been rising. The latest figures for April 2022 show a record of over 6.48 million people waiting for treatment. Despite some improvements earlier in the year, waiting times remain far higher than pre-COVID. The total number of patients waiting over 18 weeks for treatment now stands at 2.48 million, while 323,093 patients had been waiting over one year for treatment. This is 29 times the number waiting over a year in April 2022. This means 5% of all patients will currently wait over a year for treatment they need. In April 2022 the average patient spent 12.6 weeks waiting for treatment.` [link](https://www.bma.org.uk/advice-and-support/nhs-delivery-and-workforce/pressures/nhs-backlog-data-analysis)
    
    > `High waits for treatment are not new. Prior to the pandemic in February 2020 there were already 4.43 million people on a waiting list for care. At the beginning of the pandemic, the combination of suspension of non-urgent services and changes to individuals’ behaviour meant that the number of people joining the waiting list initially dropped. However, this has since been rising - and despite some improvements earlier in the year, waiting times remain far higher than pre-COVID:

    > a record of over 6.6 million people waiting for treatment,  
    > 2.41 million patients waiting over 18 weeks for treatment,  
    > 331,623 patients waiting over one year for treatment - 13 times the number waiting over a year in May 2020,  
    > a median waiting time for treatment of 12.7 weeks – significantly higher than pre-Covid duration.`
