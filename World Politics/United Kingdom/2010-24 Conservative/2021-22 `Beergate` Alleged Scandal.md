- On 12 April 2022, after Johnson was fined for breaching COVID restrictions, Starmer said that if he received a fine, he would resign as Leader of the Labour Party.
    
    - `Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said he will quit if given a fine by Durham police for breaking lockdown rules. Deputy leader Angela Rayner also confirmed she would step down if fined. The opposition leader has been under pressure after police announced a probe into an event in April 2021, when he had curry and beer at an MP's office during an election campaign visit. Sir Keir has insisted rules were not broken and Labour says it has evidence showing it was a work event.` [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-61383091)
    
- On 5 May 2022, Starmer had said it wasn’t a party and that no rules were broken.
    
    - `Speaking to reporters after Labour made gains in the local elections, the leader of the opposition said: "As I've explained a number of times, we were working in the office, we stopped for something to eat - no party, no breach of the rules. "The police obviously have got their job to do, we should let them get on with it. "But I'm confident that no rules were broken. "Meanwhile, we've had a really good set of results today."` [link](https://news.sky.com/story/beergate-durham-police-to-investigate-sir-keir-starmer-over-allegations-he-broke-lockdown-rules-12606679)
    
- On 25 May 2022, In the Commons debate when the final [[United Kingdom Contents Page]] into [[United Kingdom Contents Page]] was released, Starmer reiterated prior commitments and stated:
    
    - `I have been clear what leadership looks like. I have not broken any rules, and any attempt to compare a perfectly legal takeaway while working to this catalogue of criminality looks even more ridiculous today, but if the police decide otherwise, I will do the decent thing and step down. The public need to know that not all politicians are the same—that not all politicians put themselves above their country—and that honesty, integrity and accountability matter.` [link](https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2022-05-25/debates/E888D0F8-37F7-48A5-8598-4449887A0935/details\#contribution-DBDB2E78-1CE7-4D7A-8653-20D89D52B43C)

    -   
    - In line with established national policing guidelines, we will not name or otherwise identify any of those present at the gathering, all of whom have been informed of the investigation outcome by their legal representatives.`
