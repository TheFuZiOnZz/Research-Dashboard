### 2020-22 11 Downing Street Refurbishment
- On April 2020, Refurbishment on 11 Downing Street began whilst Johnson was being hospitalised with COVID-19.
- On 23 April 2021, the Prime Minister Boris Johnson's former aide, Dominic Cummings, made allegations on his personal blog that the prime minister had arranged for donors to secretly pay for renovations on the private residence at 11 Downing Street.
    
    > `Re the flat. The Prime Minister’s DOC has also made accusations regarding me and leaks concerning the PM’s renovation of his flat. The PM stopped speaking to me about this matter in 2020 as I told him I thought his plans to have donors secretly pay for the renovation were unethical, foolish, possibly illegal and almost certainly broke the rules on proper disclosure of political donations if conducted in the way he intended. I refused to help him organise these payments. My knowledge about them is therefore limited. I would be happy to tell the Cabinet Secretary or Electoral Commission what I know concerning this matter.` [link](https://dominiccummings.com/2021/04/23/statement-regarding-no10-claims-today/)
    
- On 28 May 2021, Lord Geidt released a report of `Annual Report by the Independent Adviser on Ministers’ Interests` which found that:
    
    > `It is clear from the record that while a serious and genuine endeavour, the Trust was not subjected to a scheme of rigorous project management by officials. Given the level of the Prime Minister’s expectations for the Trust to deliver on the objects he had set, this was a significant failing. Instead, the Prime Minister – unwisely, in my view – allowed the refurbishment of the apartment at No 11 Downing Street to proceed without more rigorous regard for how this would be funded.` [link](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/990394/Report_by_the_Independent_Adviser_May_2021__1_.pdf)
    
- On 9 December 2021, a Report of investigation released by the Electoral Commission found that:
    
    > `Our investigation looked at whether any transactions relating to works at 11 Downing Street fell within the party finance regime regulated by the Commission and whether any such transactions were recorded and reported as required.  
    >   
    > The evidence showed that the Conservative Party received a donation of £67,801.72 from Huntswood Associates Limited in October 2020 – £52,801.72 of which was to cover the cost of three invoices relating to the refurbishment of Downing Street. £15,000 was reported as a donation in the party’s Q4 2020 donation report; the remaining £52,801.72 was not.  
    >   
    > Our investigation concluded that the full amount of the £67,801.72 was a donation and should have been reported to the Commission. We also concluded that the reference to the payment made by the party for the refurbishment in the party’s financial records was not accurately recorded.  
    >   
    > The investigation found that decisions relating to the handling and recording of these transactions reflected serious failings in the party’s compliance systems. The registered treasurer had a responsibility to put in place systems appropriate to a party with a complex internal infrastructure and substantial sums of money coming into its accounts. However, in this instance, the payment was incorrectly described in internal records and the full value of the donation was not correctly identified and reported. Consequently, it was not included in our donation publication.  
    >   
    > The Commission considered other payments relating to the refurbishment works; they were not judged to be reportable donations, and so we found no offences in relation to those payments.  
    >   
    > For the offence of failing to accurately report the full value of the donation from Huntswood Associates, the Commission has imposed a penalty of £16,250. For contravening the requirement to keep proper accounting records, a penalty of £1,550 has been imposed.`

- After the Electoral Commission report released, it was accused that Johnson was misleading his ethics adviser Lord Geidt.
    
    > `Boris Johnson has been accused of misleading his own ethics adviser, exposing the prime minister to a potential suspension from the House of Commons, as MPs demanded a fresh investigation into his personal donors. With pressure mounting after a disastrous series of mistakes and scandals, Johnson’s integrity was once again under the spotlight after an official report suggested he gave differing accounts to investigators looking into the redecoration of his Downing Street flat.` [link](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/09/boris-johnson-accused-of-misleading-ethics-adviser-over-no-10-refurb)
    
- On 15 June 2022, Lord Geidt Resigned his position of Independent Adviser on Ministers' Interests. In his resignation letter, Geidt states:
    
    > `I was asked at length about my recent Annual Report. I alluded to my frustration, as made clear in my Preface, that you had not made any public reference to your own conduct under the Ministerial Code in the period since inquiries were underway. This would be especially important in the event that the Metropolitan Police found against you, which they did, and/or that Sue Gray’s report included criticism of behaviour within the scope of the Ministerial Code, which it did.  
    >   
    > Your letter in response to my Annual Report was welcome. It addressed the absence of comment by you about your obligations under that Ministerial Code up until that point. You explained that, by paying a Fixed Term Penalty, you had not breached the Ministerial Code. The letter did not, however, address specifically the criticism in Sue Gray’s report about your adherence to the Nolan Principles (on leadership, in particular). Neither did the letter make mention that, despite being repeatedly questioned in the House of Commons about your obligations under the Ministerial Code (after paying a Fixed Penalty Notice), your responses again made no reference to it.  
    >   
    > I reported to the Select Committee yesterday that I was satisfied that you had responded to my Annual Report to explain your position. I am disappointed, however, that the account you gave was not fuller, as noted above. Moreover, I regret the reference to ‘miscommunication’ between our offices, with the implication that I was somehow responsible for you not being fully aware of my concerns. These inconsistencies and deficiencies notwithstanding, I believed that it was possible to continue credibly as Independent Adviser, albeit by a very small margin.  
    >   
    > This week, however, I was tasked to offer a view about the Government’s intention to consider measures which risk a deliberate and purposeful breach of the Ministerial Code. This request has placed me in an impossible and odious position. My informal response on Monday was that you and any other Minister should justify openly your position vis-a-vis the Code in such circumstances. However, the idea that a Prime Minister might to any degree be in the business of deliberately breaching his own Code is an affront. A deliberate breach, or even an intention to do so, would be to suspend the provisions of the Code to suit a political end. This would make a mockery not only of respect for the Code but licence the suspension of its provisions in governing the conduct of Her Majesty’s Ministers. I can have no part in this.  
    >   
    > Because of my obligation as a witness in Parliament, this is the first opportunity I have had to act on the Government’s intentions. I therefore resign from this appointment with immediate effect.`

- On 8 July 2022, an invoice was leaked including a list of items for the refurbishment totalling to over £200,000.
    
    > `The Independent has obtained a leaked copy of the invoice for the renovation of the prime minister’s Downing Street flat which shows it cost more than £200,000. Items ordered by Mr Johnson and wife Carrie from upmarket interior designer Lulu Lytle include a £3,675 drinks trolley said to be like the one owned in Paris by ballet dancer Rudolph Nureyev and £2,260 worth of the “gold” wallpaper that Mr Johnson privately complained his wife had purchased. Two sofas cost more than £15,000; £3,000 was spent on a “paint effect” for the flat hallway; and the cheapest item is a £500 kitchen table cloth. The estimate for building works, which involved sanding the floorboards, painting and decorating, and installing new furnishings and fittings came to £30,000.` [[borisjohnsonwallpa]]
