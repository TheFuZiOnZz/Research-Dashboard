# Economic Analysis
- On 30 October 2024, The Office of Budget Responsibility released a `Economic and Fiscal Outlook` Report on the Labour Budget which said:
	- ` Current spending now grows in real terms by 4.8 per cent this year, 3.1 per cent next year, and by an average of 1.3 per cent between 2025-26 and 2029-30. The £23.2 billion increase in current spending in 2024-25 relative to the March forecast reflects a combination of the funding of undisclosed spending pressures that existed at the time of the March Budget and have since come to light, and the cost of new policies announced by this Government.` - [Economic and Fiscal Outlook, October 2024, Office for Budget Responsibility, 2024](https://obr.uk/docs/dlm_uploads/OBR_Economic_and_fiscal_outlook_Oct_2024.pdf)
	- `Relative to our March forecast, spending in cash terms has been revised up in each year of the forecast, by £49.8 billion this year and then an average of £91.8 billion in the four years thereafter (Table 5.2). On average over the forecast:`
	  
	  `£15.2 billion is due to changes in the underlying pre-measures forecast. This is mainly due to higher debt interest spending which has increased by £14.4 billion this year and then by £3.4 billion on average over the forecast, on a pre-measures basis, reflecting upward revisions to RPI and Bank Rate. A range of fiscally neutral spending lines (discussed in Chapter 4) are also slightly higher across the forecast.`
	  
	  `£60.1 billion is due to the direct effect of policy changes in this Budget, the largest sustained increase in spending in at least the past 15 years. Two-thirds of the policydriven spending increase goes on current spending and one-third on capital spending. Policy changes increase spending by £25.0 billion this year and then by amounts rising to £75.8 billion in 2028-29. As discussed above this is almost entirely driven by higher departmental spending allocated at this Budget (£37.2 billion on average each year over 2024-25 and 2025-26), and an increase to the DEL envelope for remaining forecast years (£67.3 billion on average each year between 2026-27 and 2028-29). The 2024-25 increase in current spending reflects a combination of the funding of undisclosed spending pressures that existed at the time of the March Budget and have since come to light, and the cost of new policies announced by this Government. In addition, significant funding has now been allocated for the infected blood and Post Office compensation schemes.
	  
	  `The indirect effects of the policy package raise spending by a further £8.1 billion a year on average, principally due to higher debt interest costs.` - [Economic and Fiscal Outlook, October 2024, Office for Budget Responsibility, 2024](https://obr.uk/docs/dlm_uploads/OBR_Economic_and_fiscal_outlook_Oct_2024.pdf)
