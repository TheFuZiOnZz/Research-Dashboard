### 2022-23 Andrew Bridgen, Suspended For COVID Misinformation, Joins Reclaim Party
- On 13 December 2022, In the Commons, Andrew Bridgen stated his opinion on the negative effect of mRNA Vaccines on the population citing common conspiracy theories and accusing the British Heart Foundation of covering up said negative effects from the public using NDAs.
    
    > `It has also been brought to my attention by a whistleblower from a very reliable source that one of these institutions is covering up clear data that reveals that the mRNA vaccine increases inflammation of the heart arteries. It is covering this up for fear that it may lose funding from the pharmaceutical industry. The lead of that cardiology research department has a prominent leadership role with the British Heart Foundation, and I am disappointed to say that he has sent out non-disclosure agreements to his research team to ensure that this important data never sees the light of day. That is an absolute disgrace. Systemic failure in an over-medicated population also contributes to huge waste of British taxpayers’ money and increasing strain on the NHS.` [link](https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2022-12-13/debates/EAB2E8A2-A721-47DD-A79C-4EFD10F10C2D/VaccinesPotentialHarms?highlight=brought%20attention%20whistleblower%20from%20very%20reliable%20source%20that%20one%20these%20institutions%20covering%20up%20clear%20data%20that%20reveals%20that%20mrna%20vaccine%20increases%20inflammation%20heart%20arteries\#contribution-1DD3E094-94E8-4AD4-A355-8D664AC095F6)
    
- On 28 December 2022, The British Heart Foundation categorically denied any claims of attempting to cover up the potential harms of mRNA COVID Vaccines.
    
    > `Bridgen’s claims that the British Heart Foundation was involved in a conspiracy to cover up the potential harms of taking the Covid vaccine were dismissed by the charity. A spokesperson told The Times: “The scientific consensus is that the benefits of Covid-19 vaccination, including a reduced risk of severe illness or death, far outweigh the very small risk of rare side effects like myocarditis or pericarditis for the vast majority of people, especially as people get older. “Scientific evidence shows that Covid-19 itself is much more likely to cause myocarditis than the vaccine is, and people who are vaccinated have a much lower risk of getting other serious complications caused by Covid-19.` [link](https://www.thenational.scot/news/23216791.tory-mps-british-heart-foundation-covid-conspiracy-claims-dismissed/)

    > `Andrew Bridgen has been suspended as a Conservative MP for spreading misinformation about Covid vaccination.

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak also condemned the remarks, calling the comparison "utterly unacceptable". Mr Hart said Mr Bridgen would lose the party whip - meaning he will sit as an independent - while a formal investigation takes place.

Fort Detrick was named. Also a facility in Canada."  
    >   
    > Bridgen followed this statement with a second tweet outlining his belief that those involved in this alleged plot are likely to be apprehended in the near future. It reads, "by the end of the month, I expect to see the start of criminal proceedings against the many politicians and officials who are responsible around the world."  
    >   
    > A few hours after posting his initial tweets, Bridgen followed up on his claims with a screenshot from the Wikipedia page concerning Fort Detrick. The section shown reads, "In August 2019, its deadly germ research operations were shut down following serious safety violations, in particular relating to the disposal of dangerous materials."`
