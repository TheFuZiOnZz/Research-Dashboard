- On 20 April 2023, Sunak receives the report into Raab’s conduct.
    
    > `As I said at the outset, this report is the product of my investigation into the facts surrounding the Complaints. It states, to the extent consistent with upholding the principle of confidentiality, my findings of fact. I reiterate the importance, for a proper understanding of the subject-matter, of reading the report as a whole. As set out in paragraphs 53 and 57 above, for the purpose of this investigation under the Ministerial Code, conduct would fall within the description of ‘bullying’ if it can be characterised as:  
    > (1) Offensive, intimidating, malicious or insulting behaviour; or  
    > (2) Abuse or misuse of power in ways that undermine, humiliate, denigrate or injure the recipient  
    >   
    > In summary, I have found as follows:  
    >   
    > (1) In relation to the DExEU Complaint:  
    > (a) The DPM’s conduct cannot be characterised as offensive, malicious or insulting. It was experienced as intimidating, in the sense of excessively demanding. I could not make a finding as to whether it was in fact intimidating in this sense. There was no evidence to suggest any abuse or misuse of power.  
    > (b) The DPM did not intend any adverse effect on others.  
    > (c) No-one drew to the DPM’s attention that his conduct was in any way problematic.  
    > (d) He did not know and could not reasonably have been aware of what is said to have been the impact of his conduct on certain individuals.  
    > (2) In relation to the FCDO Complaint:  
    > (a) The DPM made a legitimate management choice, on the basis of his genuine, adverse view about the work of others (albeit without any grounds for disciplinary action).  
    >   
    > None of the constituent elements of this accepted characterisation of bullying is a legally defined term. All of the words used are capable of a range of interpretations. Where relevant, I have explained the sense in which I have used any of these words.  
    >   
    > (b) In reaching and implementing this management choice he acted in a way which was intimidating, in the sense of unreasonably and persistently aggressive conduct in the context of a work meeting. It also involved an abuse or misuse of power in a way that undermines or humiliates. He introduced an unwarranted punitive element. His conduct was experienced as undermining or humiliating by the affected individual, which was inevitable. It is to be inferred that the DPM was aware that this would be the effect of his conduct; at the very least, he should have been aware.  
    >   
    > (c) On a separate occasion, the DPM referred to the Civil Service Code in a way which could reasonably have been understood as suggesting that those involved had acted in breach. This had a significant adverse effect on a particular individual who took it seriously. The DPM’s conduct was a form of intimidating behaviour, in the sense of conveying a threat of unspecified disciplinary action, and was experienced as such. He did not target any individual, nor intend to threaten anyone with disciplinary action. However, he ought to have realised that his reference to the Civil Service Code could well have been understood as a threat.  
    >   
    > (3) In relation to the MoJ Complaints:  
    >   
    > (a) The significance of the MoJ Group Complaint is that it paved the way for all of the other Complaints. The participants in the MoJ Group Complaint deserve credit for their courage in coming forward. But its composition and content make it unsuitable as a basis for any findings about the DPM’s conduct.  
    >   
    > (b) On a number of occasions at meetings with policy officials, the DPM acted in a manner which was intimidating, in the sense of going further than was necessary or appropriate in delivering critical feedback, and also insulting, in the sense of making unconstructive critical comments about the quality of work done (whether or not as a matter of substance any criticism was justified). By way of example, he complained about the absence of what he referred to as ‘basic information’ or ‘the basics’, about ‘obstructiveness’ on the part of officials whom he perceived to be resistant to his policies, and described some work as ‘utterly useless’ and ‘woeful’.  
    >   
    > (c) The DPM did not intend by the conduct described to upset or humiliate. Nor did he target anyone for a specific type of treatment.  
    >   
    > (d) His interruptive style is not itself behaviour that could be regarded as intimidating or insulting. However, individuals who had previously experienced the DPM express an unconstructive criticism of their work (and understood it as a criticism of them personally) might reasonably have interpreted a series of interruptions as a form of implicit criticism. The combination of unconstructive critical feedback and regular interruption is likely to be experienced as intimidating, in the sense of being unreasonably difficult to deal with, and plainly was so experienced by some individuals.  
    >   
    > (e) The DPM was not aware, nor could he reasonably have been aware, of the impact on individuals in terms of what are said to have been the effects of his behaviour on their health.  
    >   
    > (f) Adopting the language of Dame Sue Owen’s report (while acknowledging that it is not part of the definition accepted in the FDA Case and that both types of conduct may amount to bullying), the DPM’s conduct during the MoJ Period was sometimes ‘abrasive’, in the sense of a personal style which is or feels intimidating or insulting to the individual, but is not intended to be so. His conduct was not, however, ‘abusive’, in the sense of behaviour which is intended and specifically targeted.  
    >   
    > (g) The DPM has been able to regulate this level of ‘abrasiveness’ since the announcement of the investigation. He should have altered his approach earlier.  
    >   
    > (h) Since the investigation was announced, there has not been any valid ground for criticism of the DPM’s conduct.  
    >   
    > In view of the findings of fact, and in light of the Terms of Reference, questions in relation to the Ministerial Code are a matter for the Prime Minister.`

- On 21 April 2023, Raab resigns as Deputy Prime Minister, Justice Secretary and Lord Chancellor.
    
    > Raab’s Resignation Letter:  
    >   
    > `Dear Prime Minister,  
    >   
    > I am writing to resign from your government, following receipt of the report arising from the inquiry conducted by Adam Tolley KC. I called for the inquiry and undertook to resign, if it made any finding of bullying whatsoever. I believe it is important to keep my word.  
    >   
    > It has been a privilege to serve you as deputy prime minister, justice secretary and lord chancellor. I am grateful to have had the opportunity to work as a minister in a range of roles and departments since 2015, and pay tribute to the many outstanding civil servants with whom I have worked.  
    >   
    > Whilst I feel duty bound to accept the outcome of the inquiry, it dismissed all but two of the claims levelled against me. I also believe that its two adverse findings are flawed and set a dangerous precedent for the conduct of good government. First, ministers must be able to exercise direct oversight with respect to senior officials over critical negotiations conducted on behalf of the British people, otherwise the democratic and constitutional principle of ministerial responsibility will be lost. This was particularly true during my time as foreign secretary, in the context of the Brexit negotiations over Gibraltar, when a senior diplomat breached the mandate agreed by cabinet.  
    >   
    > Second, ministers must be able to give direct critical feedback on briefings and submissions to senior officials, in order to set the standards and drive the reform the public expect of us. Of course, this must be done within reasonable bounds. Mr Tolley concluded that I had not once, in four and a half years, sworn or shouted at anyone, let alone thrown anything or otherwise physically intimidated anyone, nor intentionally sought to belittle anyone. I am genuinely sorry for any unintended stress or offence that any officials felt, as a result of the pace, standards and challenge that I brought to the Ministry of Justice. That is, however, what the public expect of ministers working on their behalf.  
    >   
    > In setting the threshold for bullying so low, this inquiry has set a dangerous precedent. It will encourage spurious complaints against ministers, and have a chilling effect on those driving change on behalf of your government - and ultimately the British people.  
    >   
    > Finally, I raised with you a number of improprieties that came to light during the course of this inquiry. They include the systematic leaking of skewed and fabricated claims to the media in breach of the rules of the inquiry and the Civil Service Code of Conduct, and the coercive removal by a senior official of dedicated private secretaries from my Ministry of Justice private office, in October of last year. I hope these will be independently reviewed.  
    >   
    > I remain as supportive of you and this government, as when I first introduced you at your campaign leadership launch last July. You have proved a great prime minister in very challenging times, and you can count on my support from the backbenches.`  
    > [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-65333734)
    
    > Sunaks’ Response:  
    >   
    > `Dear Dominic,  
    >   
    > Thank you for your letter notifying me of your decision to resign from your position in His Majesty's government as deputy prime minister and lord chancellor and secretary of state for justice. It is with great sadness that I have accepted your resignation.  
    >   
    > When I became prime minister in October last year, I pledged that the government I lead would have integrity, professionalism and accountability at every level. The Ministerial Code requires ministers to uphold the highest standards.  
    >   
    > When formal complaints about your conduct in different ministerial posts were submitted last year, I appointed at your request an independent investigator to conduct a full investigation into the specific facts surrounding these complaints. Adam Tolley KC has now submitted his report and I have carefully considered its findings, as well as consulting the independent adviser on minsters' interests.  
    >   
    > As you say, you had - rightly - undertaken to resign if the report made any finding of bullying whatsoever. You have kept your word. But it is clear that there have been shortcomings in the historic process that have negatively affected everyone involved. We should learn from this how to better handle such matters in future.`
