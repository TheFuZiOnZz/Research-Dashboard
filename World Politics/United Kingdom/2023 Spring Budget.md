### Economic Analysis
- On 15 March 2023, The Office of Budget Responsibility released a `Economic and Fiscal Outlook` Report on the Spring Budget which said:
    
    > `Despite more positive economic news since November, structural weaknesses remain that have been exacerbated by recent shocks:  
    >   
    > Business investment has stagnated since 2016, with uncertainty surrounding the UK’s future trading relationship with the EU, the pandemic, the energy crisis, and rises in the post-tax cost of capital all weighing on investment decisions since then.  
    >   
    > Labour market participation, having risen since 2010 (despite the ageing of the population), has fallen dramatically in the wake of the pandemic, especially among older workers. This has left the total labour force 520,000 people smaller than we expected prior to the pandemic. And population ageing continues to weigh on participation over the forecast period.  
    >   
    > Productivity has grown at less than half its pre-financial crisis rate since 2010 and has been disrupted more recently by the pandemic and higher cost of energy. This reflects both the stagnation in business investment and weak growth in total factor productivity.`

    > `Real household disposable income (RHDI) per person – a measure of real living standards – is expected to fall by a cumulative 5.7 per cent over the two financial years 2022-23 and 2023-24. While this is 1.4 percentage points less than forecast in November, it would still be the largest two-year fall since records began in 1956-57. The fall in RHDI per person mainly reflects the rise in the price of energy and other tradeable goods of which the UK is a net importer, resulting in inflation being above nominal wage growth. This means that real living standards are still 0.4 per cent lower than their pre-pandemic levels in 2027-28. But they are 0.6 per cent higher than we forecast in November thanks to lower market expectations for medium-term gas prices and the upward revision to potential output.` [link](https://obr.uk/docs/dlm_uploads/OBR-EFO-March-2023_Web_Accessible.pdf)
    
    > `The Government’s primary fiscal target – its ‘fiscal mandate’ – is for public sector net debt excluding the Bank of England to fall in the final year of the forecast (2027-28 in this one). On our central forecast it is met by a margin of £6.5 billion (0.2 per cent of GDP), down £2.7 billion (0.1 per cent of GDP) from the margin of £9.2 billion (0.3 per cent of GDP) in our November forecast.` [link](https://obr.uk/docs/dlm_uploads/OBR-EFO-March-2023_Web_Accessible.pdf)
    
- On 15 March 2023, The Institute for Fiscal Studies released a response to the Spring Budget which said:
    
    > `There are many benefits to allowing full expensing of investment against corporation tax, though it is not without drawbacks. But the fact that this change is temporary and was only announced now is most definitely not welcome. Today’s announcement is just the latest in a long line of changes and temporary tweaks. There’s no stability, no certainty, and no sense of a wider plan.  
    >   
    > As expected, the energy price cap will remain at its current level for the next 3 months, so that an average bill will stay at £2,500 rather than rising to £3,000. There was some extra money to shore up the defence budget, alongside the extra cash for childcare. And surprise surprise, he found £6 billion to freeze fuel duties and maintain the supposedly temporary 5p-a-litre cut announced last year, despite a fall of around 40p a litre in the price of petrol over the last year. Yet we’re supposed to believe, wink wink nudge nudge, that the 5p cut will be reversed next year. Forgive me if I harbour some doubts.`

    > `The bigger fiscal picture hasn’t changed enormously since the autumn. The OBR expects the economy to grow a bit faster in the short-term, and a bit slower in the medium-term, combining to produce an economy 0.6% larger in real-terms in 2027–28 than under the autumn forecast. The government remains on track to meet its relatively loose fiscal targets by only the barest of margins, despite a historically high tax burden and some extremely tight post-election numbers for spending on public services. Debt interest spending is forecast to remain well above what was forecast a year ago. And we are still in the midst of an enormously difficult period for households. We’re by no means out of the woods yet.”` [link](https://ifs.org.uk/articles/spring-budget-2023-response)
    
- On 15 March 2023, The National Institute of Economic and Social Research released a response to the Spring Budget which said:
    
    > `The OBR have projected that the Chancellor will meet his fiscal targets for 2027-28. But, NIESR has long argued that this focus on arbitrary targets is not what should determine fiscal policy; rather we need a new framework where the emphasis is on improving outcomes for UK households and different policies are independently examined.  
    >   
    > • The decision to go ahead with the rise in corporation tax from 19 per cent to 25 per cent will dampen GDP and hurt the supply side of the economy in the long run, though this is mitigated to a degree by the range of measures the government has announced to support business investment.  
    >   
    > • The Chancellor announced increases in spending in some areas, but it was disappointing that he failed to address public-sector pay, or announce more public investment, at a time of falling output and high inflation.  
    >   
    > • While three-quarters of UK households will see their disposable incomes increase in 2023-24 compared with 2022-23, the bottom half of the income distribution – some 14 million households – will have lower living standards than two years ago. Instead of a general subsidy to everyone, policy needs to be targeted at the half of the population who need it most; NIESR proposes to use a Variable Price Cap will achieve this.  
    >   
    > • The decision to pay childcare costs upfront in Universal Credit is a welcome move. However, we believe the Chancellor’s announcement of more places on skills boot camps to encourage over-50s back to the workplace is unlikely to work as this group tend to be more concerned about health risks, job security, and a more tailored workplace balance.  
    >   
    > • It’s reassuring to see the government’s commitment to Levelling Up and devolution deals though we worry that the government’s Levelling Up policies will not benefit the whole country. While the policies will help cities, there is no evidence that city development will generate spill-overs to suburban, rural and coastal areas.`

- On 15 March 2023, The Resolution Foundation released a report as response to the Spring Budget which said:
    
    > `Following significant energy price falls, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has significantly upgraded its short-term economic outlook, with the economy expected to be 1.5 per cent larger by the end of the year than previously expected. The UK is forecast to see the sharpest one-year fall in inflation since the 1970s but avoid a technical recession in 2023, with growth supported by two temporary forces: households drawing down on their savings, and businesses bringing forward investment following Budget tax changes.  
    >   
    > But most of the short-term good news does not last, with the economy in 2027 now set to be just 0.5 per cent bigger than previously forecast. The underlying growth rate potential of the UK economy is unchanged at 1.75 per cent (1 percentage point below its pre-financial crisis norm), with this small improvement driven by lower energy costs and a bigger population that raises employment by 160,000 (notably, the OBR attributes more than the 110,000 of this increase to the Chancellor’s policy measures, equivalent to 0.3 percentage points). But over the Parliament as a whole, economic growth is forecast to average just 0.5 per cent a year, the lowest since Margaret Thatcher’s first term in office.`

- On 15 March 2023, The Institute for Government released a report as response to the Spring Budget which said:
    
    > `As anticipated, the chancellor used some of this fiscal space in the near term to keep the energy price guarantee limit at £2,500 per year for the average household, rather than rising to £3,000 as previously planned. This will stay in place until June. From then, energy prices are expected to fall below the guarantee threshold anyway, reflecting a steep fall in wholesale energy prices since the start of the year. Hunt also announced that the charges for those on prepayment meters will be brought in line with those paid by direct debit customers, bringing a welcome end to the premium that those (typically vulnerable) customers currently pay for their energy.  
    >   
    > But it is not all good news. Even with lower energy prices and more government support, real household disposable income is still expected to fall by 6% between 2021/22 and 2023/24, only slightly better than the 7% fall expected in November. UK households are still facing the largest fall in living standards since records began in the 1950s – and they won’t return to their pre-pandemic level until at least 2028, reflecting the impact of the trade shock suffered by the UK since the energy crisis began, on top of structural weaknesses in the economy.`
