### 2021 Universal Credit COVID Uplift Cut

> `A temporary £1,040 a year increase to the standard allowance for 18 months from April 2020 was introduced as part of a support package for people through the coronavirus pandemic – this temporary increase to the standard allowance ended on 6 October 2021` [link](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/universal-credit-statistics-background-information-and-methodology/universal-credit-statistics-background-information-and-methodology\#coronavirus)
- Boris Johnson said:
    
    > `I understand that people feel times are difficult at the moment because we have got an economy that's coming out of a very tough period with the Covid pandemic and it's growing strongly now` ... `What we won't do is take more money in tax to subsidise low pay through the welfare system.` [link](https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/uk-news/boris-johnson-defends-20-universal-21765990)
    
- Will Quince, The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions said:
    
    > `our focus now is on our multi-billion pound plan for jobs, which will support people in the long term by helping them to learn new skills, to increase their hours and, of course, to find new work.` [link](https://www.theyworkforyou.com/whall/?id=2021-07-21b.432.0\#g442.1)
    
- Keir Starmer said:
    
    > `Whether that’s fuel or food, or energy prices, and this is going to drive families and children into poverty and for the government to turn on the poorest as we come out of the pandemic is just so wrong` [link](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/oct/08/keir-starmer-universal-credit-cut-is-an-attack-on-the-poorest)
    
  
- The UK has the lowest unemployment benefit as a share of previous income when compared to all OECD countries of 21%, data from before the cut was implemented. [link](https://data.oecd.org/benwage/benefits-in-unemployment-share-of-previous-income.htm)
- A 2020 report found that:
    
    > `Figure 8 compares the results of this analysis to the previous projections, which include the increased generosity. It clearly shows the significant reduction in the increase in poverty that has resulted from the increase in generosity of these benefits. In each Winter 2020 scenario, these choices have insulated more than 600,000 people from poverty. For the high unemployment, high furlough scenario in Winter 2020, some 690,000 fewer people are in poverty as a result of the changes introduced to benefits and have been protected at a time of crisis` [link](https://li.com/reports/poverty-during-the-covid-19-crisis/)
    
- A 2021 report found that:
    
    > `We forecast overall absolute poverty rising into 2021-22 – mostly due to the removal of the £20 per week benefit boost from April, but also because of higher unemployment and the expiration of smaller benefit increases – and then falling in future years.` [link](https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/app/uploads/2021/01/Living-standards-outlook-2021.pdf)
    
- A 2021 report found that:
    
    > `Our analysis has shown that around 5.5 million low-income families will lose £1,040 from their annual income, creating serious financial hardship and leave 500,000 people to be swept into poverty - including 200,000 children. Families with children will be disproportionately impacted and worryingly, 6 in 10 of all single-parent families in the UK will be impacted.` [link](https://www.jrf.org.uk/universal-credit-cut-impact-constituency)
    
- A 2021 DWP report found that:
    
    > `The employment rate has increased for all people on Universal Credit to 40% (2.3 million) on 10 June 2021 from 36% (2.0 million) on 11 June 2020. The increase in the employment rate, and that it is higher than the rate before the coronavirus pandemic, should not be interpreted as more employment. It should be considered in the context of the policy changes to Universal Credit to support people through the coronavirus pandemic.` [link](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/universal-credit-statistics-29-april-2013-to-8-july-2021/universal-credit-statistics-29-april-2013-to-8-july-2021\#people-on-uc-header)
    
- A 2021 report found that:
    
    > `Poverty rates among households not in paid work have been falling, but still exceed 50 per cent. For those who live in working households, however, the likelihood of being in poverty has steadily increased: growing from 13 per cent to 17 per cent over the past 25 years` [link](https://www.ippr.org/files/2021-05/no-longer-managing-may21.pdf)
    
### 2021- Cost of Living Crisis
### 2022 Council Tax Rebate
- On 3 February 2022, Sunak announced that:
    
    > `Households in England, which are in council tax bands A-D, will also receive a £150 rebate. The rebate to bills will be made directly by local authorities from April. This will not need to be repaid.` [link](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/millions-to-receive-350-boost-to-help-with-rising-energy-costs)
    
- On 18 May 2022, Rachel Reeves, Labour’s Shadow Chancellor said:
    
    > `The action that Labour proposes is a windfall tax to take up to £600 off people’s bills. As the hon. Lady knows, energy bills have gone up 54%, by an average of £693. With all respect, £150 just does not cut it.` [link](https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2022-05-18/debates/27E5BBC2-C573-45B8-891B-F1CFF1C3E977/AchievingEconomicGrowth?highlight=windfall%20tax\#contribution-972E0255-C4AA-4868-B90E-3D64FD73D7C6)
    
  
- In 24 February 2022, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation made a short report, which included:
    
    > `The mitigations consisting of the council tax rebate and rebate loan then claw-back will cover only 60% of the increase for the average low-income family, highlighting the risk of widespread hardship if further action is not taken.` [link](https://www.jrf.org.uk/press/400000-people-could-be-pulled-poverty-real-terms-cut-benefits-april)
    
- In March 2022, the Office for Budget Responsibility released a `Economic and fiscal outlook` report, which included:
    
    > `Non-labour income growth remains relatively strong, boosted by the council tax and energy bills rebates announced in February. But with the consumption deflator rising by 5.5 per cent, the net result is an annual fall in real household disposable income of 1.5 per cent, the largest since the 1.8 percent fall in 2011.` [link](https://obr.uk//docs/dlm_uploads/CCS0222366764-001_OBR-EFO-March-2022_Web-Accessible-2.pdf)
    
- On 9 March 2022, the New Economics Foundation found that:
    
    > `Our analysis shows that, come April, and after taking account of the full suite of policy changes — including national insurance, benefit increases and higher national minimum wage — the council tax rebate will still see the poorest families lose the largest proportion of their disposable incomes to higher energy bills (figure 2 below). The lowest income 10% of families will be around £420 worse off in annual terms, or 2.5% of disposable incomes.` [link](https://neweconomics.org/2022/03/cold-homes-this-april)
    
- On 27 May 2022, the Resolution Foundation gave a response to the cost of living support package, they found that:
    
    > `more universalist support (through Council Tax rebates or energy bills) falls away in 2023-24, meaning that fiscal policy is (rightly) only trying to delay rather than prevent the impact of rising energy bills for better-off households (the energy price cap itself serves a similar function, delaying the feed through of rising wholesale prices on retail energy prices).` [link](https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/publications/back-on-target/)
    
### 2022 Energy Profits Levy Funding Cost of Living Support Package
- On 9 January 2022, A Windfall tax was originally proposed by labour.
    
    > `Labour would impose a windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas producers to fund measures to ease the cost of living squeeze, by reducing the average household energy bill by £200. The £6.6bn plan would include removing VAT on domestic energy bills for a whole year, as well as expanding and increasing the warm homes discount for those most at risk.` [link](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/08/labour-proposes-windfall-tax-on-north-sea-oil-and-gas-to-reduce-bills)
    
- Sunak originally didn't want to implement a windfall tax as he said it would deter investment.
    
    > `In an interview with Mumsnet, Rishi Sunak says that if oil and gas companies do not ramp up investment then he will consider a windfall tax. His argument has been that tax would deter investment, but the idea is popular and doing very well for Labour.` [link](https://www.itv.com/news/2022-04-27/will-rishi-sunak-impose-a-windfall-tax-on-oil-companies-in-face-of-rising-costs)
    
- On 30 March 2022, Starmer during Prime Ministers Questions said:
    
    > `All of this while oil and gas companies see unexpected bumper profits. A windfall tax would raise billions and ease the burden on working people. The former chief executive office of BP, Lord John Browne, says a windfall tax is “justifiable”. The current CEO says that BP has, in his words, “more cash than we know what to do with.” Why is the Prime Minister more interested in shielding oil and gas profits than supporting working people?` [link](https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2022-03-30/debates/F96C3BEA-0E6F-4B74-B53F-E6DF2A9FCF8B/Engagements?highlight=windfall%20tax\#contribution-D6058C5A-BCC6-4ECD-A495-39BD390F9E2D)
    
- On 19 April 2022, During a Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee on Energy pricing and the future of the Energy Market, Keith Anderson, CEO of Scottish Power said:
    
    > `I think Ofgem now fully understand the issues that we all face and that customers are facing, as well as some of the changes we need to bring through the system. ... but the one thing that Ofgem cannot fix on their own and that requires Government help and policy is people’s ability to pay. That, to me, is the biggest issue we face, outstripping everything else 10 times over. There are a lot of people out there who will not be able to pay their bill and who will struggle, and Ofgem do not have the powers to deal with that on their own. The industry does not have the power and the strength to deal with it all on its own. It requires a Government intervention.` [link](https://committees.parliament.uk/oralevidence/10102/default/)
    
- On 18 May 2022, Starmer during Prime Ministers Questions said:
    
    > `Clearly, he just cannot make his mind up, so let us have a look at who is for this and who is against it. On one side, we have the chair of Tesco; the chair of John Lewis; the Chair of the Treasury Committee; the Chair of the Education Committee; Lord Hague; and Lord Browne, the old chief executive officer of BP. They all support a windfall tax. Even the current boss of BP says a windfall tax would not discourage investment.` [link](https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2022-05-18/debates/9871FD7A-2BEA-4C79-B5AF-AC681EB598D6/Engagements\#contribution-E6254078-85FA-4561-BD5E-77859DDE5D4D)
    
- On 18 May 2022, Rachel Reeves, Labour’s Shadow Chancellor said:
    
    > `The action that Labour proposes is a windfall tax to take up to £600 off people’s bills. As the hon. Lady knows, energy bills have gone up 54%, by an average of £693. With all respect, £150 just does not cut it.  
    >   
    > Labour first proposed a windfall tax on 9 January, more than four months ago, and what was the first response from a Conservative Minister? It was to insist that a windfall tax would be unfair because Shell and BP were “struggling”. North sea oil and gas producers are making £32 million a day in unexpected profits. Meanwhile, parents trying to pay their bills are going without food so that their children do not miss meals—that is struggling. We now know that each and every day the Conservatives delay introducing a windfall tax, families and pensioners are forking out £53 million more in their energy bills.`  
    >   
    > ...  
    >   
    > `The Government got rid of the triple lock, and now they are refusing to implement a windfall tax. Every day, the case for Labour’s windfall tax gets stronger, while the Tory defence for refusing to act gets weaker and weaker, yet last night every single Conservative MP voted against a windfall tax for the third time. People can no longer afford to pay for the Government’s mistakes. The Government should put the national interest first and follow Labour’s advice. It is time to do the right thing; it is time to put the needs of people first; it is time to introduce a windfall tax to get bills down.`

- On 26 May 2022, After the release of the [[United Kingdom Contents Page]], Chancellor Rishi Sunak confirms U-turn on windfall tax to aid in the Cost of living crisis.
    
    > `The government has U-turned on its opposition to a windfall tax on oil and gas firms, announcing it will introduce a levy to help tackle rising bills. Ministers had rejected the idea - put forward by opposition parties - that would see a one-off charge imposed on the company's record profits. But Chancellor Rishi Sunak said his levy would "tax extraordinary profits fairly and incentivise investments". Labour's Rachel Reeves said Mr Sunak had "finally come to his senses". The chancellor said new tax would raise £5bn over the course of the next year, allowing the government to "help families with the cost of living", while avoiding "having to increase our debt burden further". He added: "There is nothing noble in burdening future generations with ever more debt today because politicians of the day were too weak to make the tough decisions."` [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-61590957)
    
    > Rishi: `So, like previous Governments, including Conservative ones, we will introduce a temporary targeted energy profits levy, But we have built into the new levy, We have built into the new levy a new investment allowance similar to the super deduction, which means that companies will have a new and significant incentive to reinvest their profits. The new levy will be charged on the profits of oil and gas companies at a rate of 25%. It will be temporary, and when oil and gas prices return to historically more normal levels, the levy will be phased out, with a sunset clause written into the legislation. And crucially, with our new investment allowance, we are nearly doubling the overall investment relief for oil and gas companies. That means that for every pound a company invests, it will get back 90% in tax relief. So the more a company invests, the less tax it will pay.` [link](https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2022-05-26/debates/00D0B309-467C-44F6-BC45-74E1EBA205B4/EconomyUpdate?highlight=cost%20living\#contribution-FEAB7B94-82EB-4045-9D9A-4A99769D215D)
    
    > Rachel Reeves, Labour’s Shadow Chancellor: `After today’s announcement, let there be no doubt about who is winning the battle of ideas in Britain—it is the Labour party. Today, it feels as though the Chancellor has finally realised the problems the country is facing. We first called for a windfall tax on oil and gas producers nearly five months ago, to help struggling families and pensioners. Today, he has announced that policy but he dare not say the words; it is a policy that dare not speak its name for this Chancellor. It was also Labour that first highlighted the unfairness of this Government’s buy now, pay later compulsory loan scheme. It should not have taken a rocket scientist to work out that this would not cut it, and we pointed that out at the time, but that is the mark of this Klarna Chancellor: announce now, ditch later. Here he is, once again, the Treasury’s one-man rebuttal unit, the Chancellor himself.` [link](https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2022-05-26/debates/00D0B309-467C-44F6-BC45-74E1EBA205B4/EconomyUpdate?highlight=windfall%20tax\#contribution-3330264F-1D19-436F-A1F6-2B0F06A35E4C)
    
- On 26 May 2022, support had been broadly welcomed by the energy sector, following months of cautions and calls for action from Sunak.
    
    > `“The huge increase in energy prices we’ve seen as a result of the fossil fuel crisis is unmanageable for many. So we are glad that the government is boosting its energy bill support to reduce the impact on consumers,” said Greg Jackson, CEO and founder of Octopus Energy.`  
    >   
    > `"This is a very significant package from the Government and we entirely support it,” said Stephen Fitzpatrick, founder of OVO of the newest support measures. “No scheme is perfect but this intervention will support millions of British families that need help the most. With the Treasury providing this financial support to customers, it is now up to OVO and other energy companies to work together with the Government and Ofgem to ensure that customers get the help they need to stay warm this winter.”`

- On 26 May 2022, the Institute for Fiscal Studies gave a response to the cost of living support package, they found that:
    
    > `The new energy profits levy of 25% – much higher than the 10% Labour had proposed – takes the overall tax rate on North Sea oil and gas profits from 40% to 65% from now until December 2025 (or sooner ‘if oil and gas prices return to historically more normal levels’). That is a much higher rate than is paid by onshore companies, but broadly typical of the historical rates of North Sea taxation since the 1970s. Far from this tax rise discouraging investment in the North Sea, a new ‘super-deduction’ means that North Sea investment will be massively subsidised while the higher tax rate is in place.  
    >   
    > Stuart Adam, a Senior Economist at the IFS, said:  
    >   
    > “The new super-deduction means that investing £100 in the North Sea will cost companies only £8.75, with the remaining cost paid by the government. So a massively loss-making investment could still be profitable after tax. It is hard to see why the government should provide such huge tax subsidies and thereby incentivise even economically unviable projects.”`  
    > [link](https://ifs.org.uk/publications/16066)
    
- On 27 May 2022, the Resolution Foundation gave a response to the cost of living support package, they found that:
    
    > `Yesterday’s response was a major package of support for household living costs, nearly doubling the help that had been announced this Spring. Alongside its scale, the defining feature of the support announced is that it is well targeted – filling the big gap left by the Chancellor’s previous announcements’ failure to provide sufficient support for those on lower incomes who are worst affected by surging energy bills. The winter ahead will be a long way from easy for poorer households, but it will be a lot less grim as a result of yesterday’s package.` [link](https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/publications/back-on-target/)
    
  
- On 5 August 2022, the Office for National Statistics [link](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/wellbeing/bulletins/publicopinionsandsocialtrendsgreatbritain/20to31july2022) released a statistical bulletin that found:
    
    > `The following information is on the latest period, 20 to 31 July 2022, based on adults in Great Britain.  
    >   
    > Around 9 in 10 (89%) adults reported their cost of living had risen over the past month; this is the same as the previous period (6 to 17 July) but an increase since we first started asking this question in the period 3 to 14 November 2021 (62%).  
    >   
    > Three-quarters (75%) of adults reported being very or somewhat worried about rising costs of living in the last two weeks; this estimate has remained relatively stable since we first started asking this question in the period 27 April to 8 May 2022.  
    >   
    > Over 4 in 10 (44%) adults who pay energy bills found it very or somewhat difficult to afford them, compared with 46% in the previous period.  
    >   
    > Around 1 in 5 (19%) working adults neither travelled to work nor worked from home, an increase from 15% in the previous period; this could be explained by more working adults taking annual leave during the summer holidays.`  
    
    > `In this period, we continued to ask adults about changes to their cost of living over the past month, with around 9 in 10 (89%) reporting it had increased in the latest period (the same as in the previous period). This is a rise from 62% when we first asked about this in the period 3 to 14 November 2021.  
    >   
    > Reasons reported by adults for the rise in their cost of living were an increase in:  
    >   
    > the price of food shopping (94%, the same as in the previous period)  
    > gas or electricity bills (82%, compared with 81% in the previous period)  
    > the price of fuel (77%, compared with 75% in the previous period)  
    >

### 2022 OBR’s `Fiscal Risks and Sustainability` Report
- On July 2022, the Office for Budget Responsibility released a `Fiscal risks and sustainability` report, [link](https://obr.uk//docs/dlm_uploads/Fiscal_risks_and_sustainability_2022-1.pdf) which included:
    
    > `The pandemic has had remarkably little impact on the medium-term fiscal position (with debt marginally higher but the primary balance slightly stronger), thanks in part to the substantial tax rises announced in its wake. Since our 2018 FSR, demographic pressures have eased somewhat in the nearterm thanks to a lower birth rate and slower improvements in life expectancy, reducing age-related spending as a share of GDP, while lower migration levels bring some fiscal offsets. But in the long run the pressures of an aging population on spending and the loss of existing motoring taxes in a decarbonising economy leaves public debt on an unsustainable path in the long term.`
    
    > `These emergent geopolitical and energy risks, and all of those analysed in our previous FRRs, need to be managed in the context of a set of longer-term demographic, environmental, and other structural pressures on the public finances. These are the largest, and most certain, threats to long-term fiscal sustainability – with every assessment we have published over the past decade having shown debt on an unsustainable path over the next 50 years as a result of these pressures. We have made only modest changes to the main demographic and economic assumptions underpinning our latest long-term projections, but some have significant fiscal implications`
    
    > `The continuously rising primary deficit means that net debt increases from 84 per cent of GDP in 2026-27 to 100 per cent in 2052-53 and then rises rapidly to 267 per cent of GDP by 2071-72. Despite this unsustainable path, this is 20 per cent of GDP lower than in our 2018 FSR projections. This partly reflects the improved starting primary deficit, as well as the more favourable interest rates relative to economic growth (‘R-G’) at the end of our latest medium-term horizon. Despite increasing the primary deficit by 2071-72, the cumulative effect of revised demographics across the projection period is to reduce debt as the more favourable near-term position outweighs the less favourable one in the longer term. These sources of downward revision are largely offset by the removal of net zero affected taxes.`
    
    > `These projections are not intended to provide a forecast of the actual evolution of revenue or spending. Rather they show what would happen if policy were unchanged and if our other conditioning assumptions also held true – most importantly that spending pressures are accommodated. If the projections suggest that the public finances are on an unsustainable path, and that were indeed to prove to be the case in practice, then one might expect a future government  
    > to take corrective action at some point.`  
    
    > `The combination of the primary balance and financial transactions projections set out above would leave public sector net debt and net interest spending on an unsustainable upward path over the long term (Table 4.11 and Chart 4.13 below). Up to the 2040s, net debt declines slowly reflecting relatively small primary deficits and relatively favourable growth corrected interest rates (that result in low net interest spending).`
    
    > `In all cases the fiscal gap is negative, consistent with the unsustainable fiscal position over the long run. To get the debt-to-GDP ratio to 75 per cent in 2071-72 would require a permanent increase in taxes and/or cut in spending of 4.2 per cent of GDP (£104 billion in today’s terms) in 2027-28. Since it is very unlikely that a government would try to offset several decades’ worth of future demographic and other cost pressures via a single upfront adjustment, a more realistic alternative adjustment is illustrated via the ‘gradual progress’ variant, which would require a series of tax increases or spending cuts worth an additional 1.5 per cent of GDP (£37 billion in today’s terms) each decade. This tightening is additional to any other tightening already announced, such as the health and social care levy, and in addition to announcements that are expected to affect the public finances over a longer time horizon and that are included in our central projection, such as linking changes to the State Pension age to life expectancy.`
    
### 2022 Emergency Mini-Budget
### Announcement of the Budget
- On 23 September 2022, Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng announced a set of economic policies dubbed a "mini-budget”. Among the policies announced by Kwarteng were: [link](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-growth-plan-2022-factsheet-on-income-tax/income-tax-factsheet)

    > The 45% additional rate of income tax to be abolished for the highest earners in England, Wales and Northern Ireland from April 2023 (withdrawn on 3 October)
    
    > From 6 November, reversal of the 1.25% rise in National Insurance introduced in April 2022
    
    > Plans to introduce the Health and Social Care Levy from April 2023 scrapped
    
    > Plan to scrap an increase of corporation tax from 19% to 25% in April 2023 (withdrawn on 14 October)
    
    > Around 120,000 more people on Universal Credit to be asked to look for more work or face benefit sanctions

- On 23 September 2022, As a reflection of the announcement, the Sterling fell to the Dollar and government bond yields fell.
    
    > `Through the course of Friday, the pound poked below $1.09 against the dollar — a drop of more than 3 per cent in just one day! And it also took a 2 per cent hit against the euro, showing this is not just a matter of a roaring dollar.  
    >   
    > ...  
    >   
    > Bond markets were in a spin. A drop in gilts prices pushed the yield on 10-year debt up by some 0.33 percentage points to 3.83 per cent, marking a 0.7 percentage point jump in yields over the course of the week — a massive move by the standards of a market that has historically bumped around by tiny increments.`

- On 25 September 2022, Truss defended the tax cuts as helping ordinary people.
    
    > `Liz Truss has defended the government’s economic changes as “helping ordinary people with their taxes” and “incentivising businesses to invest”.  
    >

### Reactions to the Budget
- On 27 September 2022, The International Monetary Fund urged Truss to reverse the top rate tax cut.
    
    > `The International Monetary Fund has urged Liz Truss to reverse the decision to abolish the top rate of income tax, in a highly unusual attack on the economic policy of a G7 country.  
    >   
    > The world’s lender of last resort heaped pressure on Ms Truss and the Chancellor, as it urged Kwasi Kwarteng to use his fiscal plan in November to change course.  
    >   
    > The IMF said it is “closely monitoring recent economic developments in the UK and are engaged with the authorities" and warned that the fiscal stimulus risks undermining the Bank of England’s efforts to curb inflation.`  
    > [link](https://archive.ph/RZeK5)
    
- On 28 September 2022, as a reaction to the economic effects of the budget, The Bank of England said that it would buy as many long-dated government bonds as needed between now and 14 October 2022 to stabilise financial markets, and added that it would postpone next week's start of its gilt sale programme.
    
    > `As the Governor said in his statement on Monday, the Bank is monitoring developments in financial markets very closely in light of the significant repricing of UK and global financial assets.  
    >   
    > This repricing has become more significant in the past day – and it is particularly affecting long-dated UK government debt. Were dysfunction in this market to continue or worsen, there would be a material risk to UK financial stability. This would lead to an unwarranted tightening of financing conditions and a reduction of the flow of credit to the real economy.  
    >   
    > In line with its financial stability objective, the Bank of England stands ready to restore market functioning and reduce any risks from contagion to credit conditions for UK households and businesses.  
    >   
    > To achieve this, the Bank will carry out temporary purchases of long-dated UK government bonds from 28 September. The purpose of these purchases will be to restore orderly market conditions. The purchases will be carried out on whatever scale is necessary to effect this outcome. The operation will be fully indemnified by HM Treasury.`

- On 28 September 2022, It was revealed that the reason for the Bank of England’s intervention was because of a response from the markets which, if continued without such intervention, would of led to the collapse of the British Pension system.
    
    > `The Bank of England's dramatic intervention today was in response to a "run dynamic" emerging in the British pensions system which could have resulted in the collapse of a swathe of institutions within hours, Sky News understands.  
    >   
    > Bank staff worked through the night on Tuesday and into Wednesday morning to prepare the unprecedented package, which will see it buying up a potentially limitless number of targeted government bonds.`

- On 28 September 2022, The Treasury announced that they had no plans to change course with the budget proposals.
    
    > `Treasury minister Andrew Griffith said the government's proposals were the "right plans" to grow the UK economy.  
    >   
    > He claimed "every major economy is dealing with exactly the same issues" and said the impact of "Putin's war in Ukraine is cascading through things like the cost of energy, some of the supply side implications of that".`

- On 29 September 2022, The Bank of England’s Chief Economist and Executive Director for Monetary Analysis, Huw Pill, in a speech said,
    
    > `These operations do not create central bank money on a lasting basis. As a result they will not shift the underlying macroeconomically-relevant monetary trends in the economy, which ultimately pin down developments in the price level. They are not intended to cap or control longer-term interest rates or to offer more favourable underlying financing conditions to the institutions involved – or, for that matter, to the Government – than would have prevailed in an orderly market environment.  
    >   
    > In the spirit of the famous Bagehot rule addressing the threat of bank deposit runs, yesterday’s intervention is intended to prevent painful, adverse self-fulfilling market dynamics emerging.  
    >   
    > That is why yesterday’s intervention is a “temporary and targeted financial stability operation”. It is intended to allow the inevitable and necessary re-pricing of financial assets stemming from recent macroeconomic news – including last week’s fiscal announcements – to take place in an orderly way.`

- On 2 October 2022, Truss admitted that ground should have been laid for tax cuts and that the Chancellor, Kwarteng, didn't discuss the top level cut with the rest of the cabinet.
    
    > `Liz Truss has admitted she should have "laid the ground better" for her mini-budget, after it sparked days of market turmoil.  
    >   
    > The prime minister told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg she had "learned from that", but she was confident her tax cutting package would boost economic growth.  
    >   
    > She added a decision to cut the top earner tax rate was a "decision that the chancellor made".  
    >   
    > And she revealed it was not discussed with the whole cabinet beforehand.`

### Lack Of OBR Forecasting
- Before the budgets announcement, Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng refused to let the Office for Budget Responsibility release forecasts on the mini-budget.
    
    > `Kwasi Kwarteng has refused to let a government watchdog assess the economic impact of planned tax cuts expected in a mini-budget on Friday.  
    >   
    > Mel Stride, the Tory chair of the Treasury select committee, urged Kwarteng to allow independent forecasts for the public finances to be published alongside his mini-budget on Friday. Stride released a strongly worded statement urging more clarity around the effects of the new chancellor’s fiscal interventions.`  
    > [link](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/sep/20/kwasi-kwarteng-urged-to-allow-release-of-obr-forecasts-with-mini-budget)
    
- On 30 September 2022, A reply letter between the SNP Leader of the Commons, Ian Blackford and the Chair of the Office of Budget Responsibility revealing that the OBR were not commissioned by the Chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng to produce a forecast on the mini budget but expressed they were prepared to based on the remit of the OBR.
    
    > `As we set out in our letter to the Chair of the Treasury Committee on 26 August, we took steps over the summer to prepare a forecast to coincide with the election of the new Prime Minister and any subsequent fiscal policy announcements. We sent a draft economic and fiscal forecast to the new Chancellor on 6 September, his first day in office. We offered, at the time, to update that forecast to take account of subsequent data and to reflect the economic and fiscal impact of any policies the Government announced in time for it to be published alongside the ‘fiscal event’ planned for later in the month.  
    >   
    > In the event, we were not commissioned to produce an updated forecast alongside the Chancellor’s Growth Plan on 23 September, although we would have been in a position to do so to a standard that satisfied the legal requirements of the Charter for Budget Responsibility enacted by Parliament`  
    > [link](https://obr.uk//docs/dlm_uploads/Sep2022_IBlackfordMP_forecast.pdf)
    
- On 3 October 2022, The Commons Treasury committee announced that it was beginning to investigate the lack of OBR Forecast published after listening to evidence from major UK economic experts which dismissed both the proposed growth numbers touted by Truss and claims of the reaction by the Bank of England to this package being a worldwide problem, not a UK specific problem.
    
    > `Senior economists have dismissed Liz Truss’s chances of reaching 2.5% economic growth in the next few years, as they said her government’s “guerrilla tactics” in last month’s mini-budget played a major role in spooking markets.  
    >   
    > Speaking to the Commons Treasury committee, the economists said the 2.5% growth target was “almost impossible”. The committee has launched its own investigation into the mini-budget in the absence of a formal forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility.  
    >   
    > The economists also dismissed the arguments of Jacob Rees-Mogg, the business secretary, that turmoil in pension funds had been caused by global factors alone, and warned that Kwasi Kwarteng, the chancellor, would need to unveil either spending cuts or tax increases to reassure markets in a promised statement on 31 October.  
    >   
    > Answering questions from the cross-party committee of MPs, Jagjit Chadha, the head of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) thinktank, said confidence had been badly undermined by “what can only be described as guerrilla tactics against our independent economic institutions over the summer: the Treasury, the Bank of England and the OBR”.  
    >   
    > He said: “There was a sense in which there was undermining of the cooperative arrangements that we had between the monetary and financial institutions, that theoretically and in practice have led to lower interest rates and lower deficits than would otherwise have to be the case.`

- On 23 September 2022, A letter between the SNP Leader of the Commons, Ian Blackford and the Chair of the Office of Budget Responsibility showed the OBR being asked for clarity around the lack of economic forecasting.
    
    > `...given today’s events on the financial markets we particularly believe urgent updates and forecasts are needed on the following.  
    >   
    > • A renewed forecast on mortgage costs for households facing rising interest rates.  
    > • The impact of the plummeting pound on imports, especially food prices ahead of this winter.  
    > • And the immediate and long-term cost of increased bond borrowing on the public finances.  
    >   
    > We believe your office’s independent analysis is essential if we are to fully understand the depth of the damage done by the Chancellor in today’s statement. Families and businesses need to know the consequences of the political choices made by this reckless UK government.

### Economic Analysis
- On 23 September 2022, The Institute for Fiscal Studies released a response to the budget proposal which said:
    
    > `Paul Johnson, IFS Director, said:  
    >   
    > Today, the Chancellor announced the biggest package of tax cuts in 50 years without even a semblance of an effort to make the public finance numbers add up. Instead, the plan seems to be to borrow large sums at increasingly expensive rates, put government debt on an unsustainable rising path, and hope that we get better growth.  
    >   
    > ...  
    >   
    > The Government’s costing of the Energy Price Guarantee for households and non-domestic consumers - £60 billion over the next six months - means that borrowing this year is now on course to climb to £190 billion. At 7.5% of national income this would make it the third-highest peak in borrowing since the Second World War, after the Global Financial Crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic.  
    >   
    > By 2026-27 we now forecast that borrowing will be over £110 billion - 3.9% of GDP - which is more than £80 billion higher than the £32 billion forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility in March. Over half of this increase in borrowing is due to the almost £45 billion a year of tax cuts announced by the Chancellor today.`  
    > [link](https://ifs.org.uk/articles/mini-budget-response)
    
- On 24 September 2022, The Resolution Foundation released a response to the budget proposal which said:
    
    > `The tax cuts confirmed yesterday are strongly focused on higher-income households, driven by the reversal of the rise in National Insurance and the scrapping of the additional 45p rate of Income Tax, along with associated cuts to Dividend Tax. Next year they will see someone earning £200,000 gain £5,220 a year, with the gain rising to £55,220 for a £1 million earner. Those on £20,000 will gain just £157. The result is that almost half (47 per cent) of the gains will go to the richest 5 per cent of households, compared to 12 per cent for the entire poorer half. Moreover, those living in the South East or London will see over three-times (on average, £1,600) the gains of those in the North East, Wales and Yorkshire (an average of £500). The South is also where the main impact of a welcome cut to Stamp Duty will be felt: the tax bill on the sale of the average first-time buyer home in London will fall by £6,300, compared to no gain for the average first-time buyer in the North East.  
    >   
    > This package of tax cuts largely reverses rises announced by Rishi Sunak in recent years, but does not do so entirely: the four-year freeze to income tax thresholds remains in place. The scale of that freeze in an era of high inflation means that the vast majority of earners will still see their personal taxes increased when all tax changes announced during this Parliament are taken into account. Those earning under £155,000 will see their tax bill increase or be unaffected, with only those earning over £155,000 will receive a net tax cut thanks to the scrapping of the 45p tax rate. Workers earning between £63,000 and £125,000 lose the most (almost £1,500 in 2025-26). A similar pattern can be seen among households, even considering increases to benefit generosity as well: only the top 5 per cent will see significant income gains from policy changes (averaging £2,520 by 2025-26). Despite the rhetoric, tax as a share of the economy remains at its highest sustained level since the 1940s (at around 35 per cent of GDP).`

### 1st U-Turn
- On 3 October 2022, Truss and Kwarteng axed the idea to remove the top rate of income tax.
    
    > `Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng has confirmed that the government is axing plans to give the wealthiest 1% a tax cut following a bitter backlash from Tory MPs.  
    >   
    > Mr Kwarteng said in a tweet that the measure had become a "distraction" from his objective to grow the economy.

### 2nd U-Turn & Kwarteng Sacking
- On 14 October 2022, after further economic turmoil, It was announced that Truss had replaced Kwarteng as Chancellor of the Exchequer with Jeremy Hunt along with replacing Chris Philip as Chief Secetary to the Treasury with Edward Argar.
    
    > Kwarteng Resignation Letter: `You have asked me to stand aside as your Chancellor. I have accepted.  
    >   
    > When you asked me to serve as your Chancellor, I did so in full knowledge that the situation we faced was incredibly difficult. with rising global interest rates and energy prices. However. your vision of optimism, growth and change was right.  
    >   
    > As I have said many times in the past weeks. following the status quo was simply not an option. For too long this country has been dogged by low growth rates and high taxation — that must still change if this country is to succeed.  
    >   
    > The economic environment has changed rapidly since we set out the Growth Plan on 23 September. In response, together with the Bank of England and excellent officials at the Treasury we have responded to those events, and I commend my officials for their dedication. It is important now as we move forward to emphasise your government's commitment to fiscal discipline. The Medium-Term Fiscal Plan is crucial to this end, and 1 look formed to supporting you and my successor to achieve that from the backbenches.`

### 3rd U-Turn
- On 17 October 2022, Hunt announced in a statement to the House of Commons that most of the tax cuts in the original mini-budget that haven't progressed as bills in parliament were being axed.
    
    > `Jeremy Hunt has scrapped nearly all tax cuts announced in last month's mini-Budget, including deferring a 1p cut to income tax "indefinitely" and axing a proposed cut to corporation tax in a major U-turn for Liz Truss' Government.  
    >   
    > He said: "No government can control markets but every government can give certainty about the sustainability of public finances... We will reverse almost all the tax measures in growth plan. At a time when markets are rightly demanding a commitment to sustainable finances it is not right to borrow to fund this."`  
    > [link](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2022/10/18/key-points-jeremy-hunt-statement-mean-economy/)
    
    > Hunt’s statement to the Commons `the Prime Minister and I agreed yesterday to reverse almost all the tax measures announced in the Growth Plan three weeks ago that have not been legislated for in Parliament. So we will continue with the abolition of the Health and Social Care Levy, changes to Stamp Duty, the increase in the Annual Investment Allowance to £1 million, and the wider reforms to investment taxes. But we will no longer be proceeding with: The cut to dividend tax rates, saving around £1 billion a year. The reversal of the off-payroll working reforms introduced in 2017 and 2021, saving around £2 billion a year. The new VAT-free shopping scheme for non-UK visitors, saving a further £2 billion a year. Or the freeze to alcohol duty rates, saving around £600 million a year.` [link](https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/chancellor-statement-17-october)

    > Introducing a Electricity Generator Levy of 45%
    
### Economic Analysis
- On 17 November 2022, The Office of Budget Responsibility released a `Economic and Fiscal Outlook` Report on the Autumn Statement which said:
    
    > `The 17 November Autumn Statement announced further support in the near term – including further cost-of-living payments to those in receipt of various benefits and cuts to business rates, as well as additional spending on health and social care, and schools (rising to £5.9 billion and £2.5 billion respectively in 2024-25). These are largely financed by windfall taxes (raising the EPL rate and introducing a new tax on renewable and nuclear power not covered by contracts for difference). From 2024-25 onwards, the Autumn Statement lowers borrowing by progressively larger amounts rising to £61.7 billion (2.1 per cent of GDP) in 2027-28. Net tax rises account for half of this tightening (£31.0 billion), with £19.4 billion coming from cuts to departmental current spending and £11.8 billion from cuts to departmental capital spending.` [link](https://obr.uk/docs/dlm_uploads/CCS0822661240-002_CCS001_SECURE_OBR_EFO_November_2022_BOOKMARK.pdf)
    
    > `The measures announced since March 2022 total £64 billion in 2022-23 and £40 billion in 2023-24 (2.6 and 1.6 per cent of GDP). This boosts real incomes, supporting household consumption, so the 2.1 per cent peak-to-trough fall in GDP is a little over 1 percentage point shallower than it would have been in the absence of these policies, and the unemployment rate is 3.6 per cent in 2022-23 and 4.3 per cent in 2023-24, around 0.2 percentage points (around 70,000) lower than it would have been otherwise.` [link](https://obr.uk/docs/dlm_uploads/CCS0822661240-002_CCS001_SECURE_OBR_EFO_November_2022_BOOKMARK.pdf)
    
    > `The UK is being hit by a large terms of trade shock that is set to push inflation to its highest rate in 40 years and drive historic falls in real household disposable income. This inevitably makes households worse off. On a fiscal year basis, RHDI per person (a measure of living standards) falls by 4.3 per cent in 2022-23, which would be the largest since ONS records began in 1956-57. That is followed by the second largest fall in 2023-24 at 2.8 per cent. This would be only the third time since 1956-57 that RHDI per person has fallen for two consecutive fiscal years – the last time this happened was in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. And the 7.1 per cent cumulative fall from 2021-22 to 2023-24 is large enough to take RHDI per person to its lowest since 2013-14. By 2027-28, RHDI per person recovers its 2021-22 level, but remains over 1 per cent below pre-pandemic levels.` [link](https://obr.uk/docs/dlm_uploads/CCS0822661240-002_CCS001_SECURE_OBR_EFO_November_2022_BOOKMARK.pdf)
    
- On 17 November 2022, The Institute for Fiscal Studies released a response to the Autumn Statement which said:
    
    > `As expected, the new Chancellor had to contend with a much worse economic and fiscal outlook than forecast back in March. For 2025-26, weak growth and high inflation led to receipts being revised down by £25 billion and spending on benefits and state pensions being revised up by £14 billion. Even more strikingly, the upwards revision to the Office for Budget Responsibility’s assumed parth for interest rates led to forecast spending on debt interest in that year being doubled from £47 billion to £95 billion. On top of this, policy announcements since March - in particular the decision not to introduce the health and social care levy - added around another £16 billion to borrowing in that year. Overall, before incorporating the measures from today’s Autumn Statement, the increase in borrowing amounted to around £90 billion in 2026-27. A lot has certainly changed since March.` [link](https://ifs.org.uk/articles/autumn-statement-2022-response)
    
    > `Living standards growth since 2008 has been extremely weak by historical standards. Unsurprisingly given the cost of living crisis, today’s Office for Budget Responsibility forecast suggests that this is going from bad to worse. This year we are set to see the largest fall in real household disposable income per head (4.3%) since the late 1940s; next year, we are set to see the second-largest fall (2.8%). Modest growth is expected to return after that, but even by 2027-28 we are not expected to have had a single year of growth higher than the pre-2008 average since 2015-16. Average household income per head is due to be the same in 2027-28 as it was in 2018-19, and 31% below where it would have been if the pre-2008 trend had continued.` [link](https://ifs.org.uk/articles/autumn-statement-2022-response)
    
- On 17 November 2022, The National Institute of Economic and Social Research released a response to the Autumn Statement which said:
    
    > `The series of unfortunate events that caused a turmoil in the financial markets and public finances has left the Chancellor rushing to unleash a fiscal contraction to fulfil arbitrary fiscal targets amidst the headwinds the economy is facing. Given the current economic climate of persistent high inflation and sluggish growth, the changes made to the fiscal targets are a step in the right direction as they enabled him to provide at least some support to households this year.` [link](https://www.niesr.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2022-NIESRs-Autumn-Statement-Response-FINAL.pdf)
    
    > `Today, the Chancellor has announced an effective tax rise for all working people by freezing thresholds on personal incomes taxes. Given that the latest ONS data indicates that real wages fell by 2.6 per cent on the year, we had hoped the Chancellor would not implement this policy in the lower thresholds – as it will further squeeze budgets that are already at capacity due to the cost-of-living crisis. That being said, the lowering of the top rate of income tax threshold to £125,140 as well as decreases to the capital gains and dividend tax reliefs are suitable measures since affected households are in a much better place to cope with surging prices. While we appreciate the Chancellor’s mention that his increases to windfall taxes are temporary, we wonder whether the extension of what was once a one-off policy will set an unhelpful precedent for future Chancellors looking to fill self-dug ‘fiscal holes’.` [link](https://www.niesr.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2022-NIESRs-Autumn-Statement-Response-FINAL.pdf)
    
    > `The Chancellor has announced several spending changes, retaining some of the government’s previous spending commitments and plans on infrastructure investment. Maintaining the levels of public investment in the short term is a step in the right direction, but public investment spending could and should be increased, especially in the long term, where the announced freeze translates into a cut in real terms.` [link](https://www.niesr.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2022-NIESRs-Autumn-Statement-Response-FINAL.pdf)
    
- On 18 November 2022, The Resolution Foundation released a report as response to the Autumn Statement which said:
    
    > `A key determinant of tax revenues over the medium term is the rate at which the economy can grow without generating inflation. The OBR has downgraded its estimate of growth in potential supply between 2021 and 2026 by 1.4 percentage points to 11.8 per cent. But they remain notably more optimistic than the Bank of England.  
    >   
    > The OBR's optimism is also clear in comparison to the UK's recent past. They are expecting potential GDP to grow faster over the next 5 years (1.7 per cent at an annualised rate) than the average growth rate of actual GDP over the 12 years leading up to the pandemic (1.2 per cent) (see Figure 6). Growth in population and productivity are the main drivers of potential supply in the long term. The OBR is expecting population growth to decelerate to 0.6 per cent per year, albeit somewhat faster than their expectation in March 2022, while it is expecting annualised productivity growth to accelerate markedly from 0.4 (2007 to 2019) to 1.0 per cent (in 2027).`

    > `One of the most persistent economic impacts of Covid-19 has been the hit to labour supply, with participation still down by 396,000 as of September 2022 compared to February 2020. This has largely come from lower participation among older workers, with signs of earlier retirements and a rise in ill-health among this group. The OBR have now factored persistently lower labour supply into their forecasts: it thinks that the 16+ participation rate will remain at 63 per cent (roughly a percentage point lower than the 2019 level), slightly lower than expected in March.` [link](https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/app/uploads/2022/11/Help-today-squeeze-tomorrow.pdf)
    
    > `Yesterday, Jeremy Hunt delivered an Autumn Statement that combined the ‘tough choices’ rhetoric of George Osborne and the policies of Gordon Brown. In the face of grim economic – and grimmer fiscal – forecasts, he announced energy support today but tougher times tomorrow, with huge stealth tax rises for the middle and top followed by far less concrete spending cuts pencilled in for after the next election.  
    >   
    > These decisions were made in the light of the fact that, as an energy importer during an energy price shock, Britain is getting poorer. Deciding exactly how that blow should be shared out between different households, as well as between current and future taxpayers was, to a significant extent, the task facing the Chancellor. He has decided that households will do so with higher energy bills, higher taxes, and worse public services than previously expected. Whether or not making the choices was tough, the reality of living through the next few years will be.`

- On 25 November 2022, The Institute for Government released a report as response to the Autumn Statement which said:
    
    > `Did the statement deliver enough funds to maintain standards and address backlogs over the rest of this parliament?  
    >   
    > The chancellor said that the Conservatives wouldn’t “leave our debts to the next generation”. While that may or may not be true, it is certainly the case that this government has largely left its fiscal consolidation to the next parliament. Hunt provided some additional funding in the next two years for schools, the NHS and social care, but £22 billion of cuts across all day-to-day spending have been pencilled in for 2025/26 to 2027/28 – after the next general election, which will be in January 2025 at the latest.  
    >   
    > After the autumn statement, the overall settlement for day-to-day departmental spending across the current spending review period (2022/23 to 2024/25), accounting for the changing inflation forecast, looks broadly comparable to the original announcement in October 2021, which many commentators described as generous.`

    > If Hunt’s 2025/26 plans were announced at a spending review in 2025, they would be less generous than every spending review announcement since 2002 – with the telling exceptions of 2010 and 2015, delivered as part of George Osborne’s austerity programme. Osborne’s 2015 plans proved undeliverable, with the government later finding it necessary to provide emergency funding to social care, the NHS and criminal justice in response to poor performance. Given that public services are now performing much worse than in 2015, it is likely that the next government will face major political pressure to spend more than planned in this autumn statement.` [link](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/sites/default/files/publications/autumn-statement-2022-public-services.pdf)
    
### 2023 UK Accession to the CPTPP
- The Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) is a trade agreement between Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, and Vietnam.
- On 1 February 2021, the UK formally applied to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP).
    
    > `We would now like to formalise our request to commence accession negotiations. I hope you will consider our request favourably and we stand ready to engage with you in order to establish a Working Group and to agree a timetable to negotiate the UK’s accession.` [link](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/formal-request-to-commence-uk-accession-negotiations-to-cptpp)
    
- On 29 March 2023, the UK was accepted into the CPTPP.
    
    > `Britain will be welcomed into an Indo-Pacific trade bloc late Thursday as ministers from the soon-to-be 12-nation trade pact meet in a virtual ceremony across multiple time zones.  
    >   
    > Chief negotiators and senior officials from member countries agreed Wednesday that Britain has met the high bar to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), four people familiar with the talks told POLITICO.  
    >   
    > Negotiations are “done” and Britain’s accession is “all agreed [and] confirmed,” said a diplomat from one member nation. They were granted anonymity as they were unauthorized to discuss deliberations.`

- A 2021 Department of International Trade White Paper found that the estimated percentage increase in domestic greenhouse gas is higher than the increase of GDP to the UK.
    
    > `While joining CPTPP11 is estimated to increase the UK’s domestic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, it is estimated to reduce emissions intensity. GHG emissions are expected to increase by 0.025% over projected levels in 2035. This is less than the estimated percentage increase in GDP, which is 0.08%.` [link](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1027860/dit-cptpp-uk-accession-strategic-approach.pdf)q
    
- A 2021 House of Lords International Agreements Committee White Paper found that the goal of joining the CPTPP was not expected to bring large-scale economic benefits in the short term.
    
    > `DIT’s Scoping Assessment included in the Strategic Approach makes the economic case for accession. Yet the Government’s own modelling shows that joining CPTPP is expected to boost UK trade, GDP and wages for UK workers by only a modest amount in the long run (after c. 15 years), with the estimated percentage increase in GDP being 0.08%. This low figure factors in existing or planned bilateral free trade agreements with the majority of the members. Larger gains would, however, be realised from the potential expansion of the membership to include Thailand and South Korea. The table below compares the long-term economic impacts of accession with and without such expansion.` [link](https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/7859/documents/81612/default/)
    
### 2023 Spring Budget
- On 15 March 2023, Chancellor Hunt announced the Spring Budget in which revealed a list of economic and fiscal policies. The policy’s included, [link](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1144441/Web_accessible_Budget_2023.pdf)
    
    > Corporation Tax for business with profits over £250,000 to increase from 19% to 25% from April 2023.
    
    > Companies with profits between £50,000 and £250,000 to pay between 19% and 25% in Corporation Tax from April 2023.
    
    > £80m announced for 12 new investment zones where companies will enjoy tax breaks and other benefits.
    
    > Prison sentences announced for anyone convicted of marketing a tax avoidance scheme.
    
    > A commitment to spend an extra £11bn on defence over the next five years.
    
    > £900m for a new supercomputer to support the UK's Artificial Intelligence sector.
    
    > Increasing of the tax-free yearly allowance for pensions from £40,000 to £60,000.
    
    > Extension of the Energy Price Guarantee until 30 June 2023.
    
    > An extra £200m to reduce charges for energy prepayment metres and bring them in line with direct debit payments, affecting around four million households.
    
    > The extension on the freeze on Fuel duty, for another year, until April 2024.
    
    > £20bn to be invested in low carbon energy projects over the next two decades, with a focus on carbon capture and storage.
    
    > 30 hours of free childcare for parents in England with children over the age of nine months to be phased in from April 2024 to September 2025, starting with 15 hours of childcare for children over the age of two in April 2024, and 15 hours for children over nine months from September 2024.
    
    > Families on Universal Credit to have their childcare support paid in advance rather than in arrears, with the monthly £645 payment for each child to rise to £951.
    
    > People to be offered a £600 "incentive" to become childminders, with the rules on the number of children who can be looked after by a childminder in England to be relaxed.
    
    > Announcement of Universal Support, a new voluntary work programme for disabled people in England and Wales.
    
    > Lead child carers on Universal Credit will face tougher requirements to look for work and increased job support.
    
    > A £63m programme is announced to encouraged retirees over 50 to return to work.
    
### Economic Analysis
- On 15 March 2023, The Office of Budget Responsibility released a `Economic and Fiscal Outlook` Report on the Spring Budget which said:
    
    > `Despite more positive economic news since November, structural weaknesses remain that have been exacerbated by recent shocks:  
    >   
    > Business investment has stagnated since 2016, with uncertainty surrounding the UK’s future trading relationship with the EU, the pandemic, the energy crisis, and rises in the post-tax cost of capital all weighing on investment decisions since then.  
    >   
    > Labour market participation, having risen since 2010 (despite the ageing of the population), has fallen dramatically in the wake of the pandemic, especially among older workers. This has left the total labour force 520,000 people smaller than we expected prior to the pandemic. And population ageing continues to weigh on participation over the forecast period.  
    >   
    > Productivity has grown at less than half its pre-financial crisis rate since 2010 and has been disrupted more recently by the pandemic and higher cost of energy. This reflects both the stagnation in business investment and weak growth in total factor productivity.`  
    > [link](https://obr.uk/docs/dlm_uploads/OBR-EFO-March-2023_Web_Accessible.pdf)
    
    > `Real household disposable income (RHDI) per person – a measure of real living standards – is expected to fall by a cumulative 5.7 per cent over the two financial years 2022-23 and 2023-24. While this is 1.4 percentage points less than forecast in November, it would still be the largest two-year fall since records began in 1956-57. The fall in RHDI per person mainly reflects the rise in the price of energy and other tradeable goods of which the UK is a net importer, resulting in inflation being above nominal wage growth. This means that real living standards are still 0.4 per cent lower than their pre-pandemic levels in 2027-28. But they are 0.6 per cent higher than we forecast in November thanks to lower market expectations for medium-term gas prices and the upward revision to potential output.` [link](https://obr.uk/docs/dlm_uploads/OBR-EFO-March-2023_Web_Accessible.pdf)
    
    > `The Government’s primary fiscal target – its ‘fiscal mandate’ – is for public sector net debt excluding the Bank of England to fall in the final year of the forecast (2027-28 in this one). On our central forecast it is met by a margin of £6.5 billion (0.2 per cent of GDP), down £2.7 billion (0.1 per cent of GDP) from the margin of £9.2 billion (0.3 per cent of GDP) in our November forecast.` [link](https://obr.uk/docs/dlm_uploads/OBR-EFO-March-2023_Web_Accessible.pdf)
    
- On 15 March 2023, The Institute for Fiscal Studies released a response to the Spring Budget which said:
    
    > `There are many benefits to allowing full expensing of investment against corporation tax, though it is not without drawbacks. But the fact that this change is temporary and was only announced now is most definitely not welcome. Today’s announcement is just the latest in a long line of changes and temporary tweaks. There’s no stability, no certainty, and no sense of a wider plan.  
    >   
    > As expected, the energy price cap will remain at its current level for the next 3 months, so that an average bill will stay at £2,500 rather than rising to £3,000. There was some extra money to shore up the defence budget, alongside the extra cash for childcare. And surprise surprise, he found £6 billion to freeze fuel duties and maintain the supposedly temporary 5p-a-litre cut announced last year, despite a fall of around 40p a litre in the price of petrol over the last year. Yet we’re supposed to believe, wink wink nudge nudge, that the 5p cut will be reversed next year. Forgive me if I harbour some doubts.`  
    > [link](https://ifs.org.uk/articles/spring-budget-2023-response)
    
    > `The bigger fiscal picture hasn’t changed enormously since the autumn. The OBR expects the economy to grow a bit faster in the short-term, and a bit slower in the medium-term, combining to produce an economy 0.6% larger in real-terms in 2027–28 than under the autumn forecast. The government remains on track to meet its relatively loose fiscal targets by only the barest of margins, despite a historically high tax burden and some extremely tight post-election numbers for spending on public services. Debt interest spending is forecast to remain well above what was forecast a year ago. And we are still in the midst of an enormously difficult period for households. We’re by no means out of the woods yet.”` [link](https://ifs.org.uk/articles/spring-budget-2023-response)
    
- On 15 March 2023, The National Institute of Economic and Social Research released a response to the Spring Budget which said:
    
    > `The OBR have projected that the Chancellor will meet his fiscal targets for 2027-28. But, NIESR has long argued that this focus on arbitrary targets is not what should determine fiscal policy; rather we need a new framework where the emphasis is on improving outcomes for UK households and different policies are independently examined.  
    >   
    > • The decision to go ahead with the rise in corporation tax from 19 per cent to 25 per cent will dampen GDP and hurt the supply side of the economy in the long run, though this is mitigated to a degree by the range of measures the government has announced to support business investment.  
    >   
    > • The Chancellor announced increases in spending in some areas, but it was disappointing that he failed to address public-sector pay, or announce more public investment, at a time of falling output and high inflation.  
    >   
    > • While three-quarters of UK households will see their disposable incomes increase in 2023-24 compared with 2022-23, the bottom half of the income distribution – some 14 million households – will have lower living standards than two years ago. Instead of a general subsidy to everyone, policy needs to be targeted at the half of the population who need it most; NIESR proposes to use a Variable Price Cap will achieve this.  
    >   
    > • The decision to pay childcare costs upfront in Universal Credit is a welcome move. However, we believe the Chancellor’s announcement of more places on skills boot camps to encourage over-50s back to the workplace is unlikely to work as this group tend to be more concerned about health risks, job security, and a more tailored workplace balance.  
    >   
    > • It’s reassuring to see the government’s commitment to Levelling Up and devolution deals though we worry that the government’s Levelling Up policies will not benefit the whole country. While the policies will help cities, there is no evidence that city development will generate spill-overs to suburban, rural and coastal areas.`

- On 15 March 2023, The Resolution Foundation released a report as response to the Spring Budget which said:
    
    > `Following significant energy price falls, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has significantly upgraded its short-term economic outlook, with the economy expected to be 1.5 per cent larger by the end of the year than previously expected. The UK is forecast to see the sharpest one-year fall in inflation since the 1970s but avoid a technical recession in 2023, with growth supported by two temporary forces: households drawing down on their savings, and businesses bringing forward investment following Budget tax changes.  
    >   
    > But most of the short-term good news does not last, with the economy in 2027 now set to be just 0.5 per cent bigger than previously forecast. The underlying growth rate potential of the UK economy is unchanged at 1.75 per cent (1 percentage point below its pre-financial crisis norm), with this small improvement driven by lower energy costs and a bigger population that raises employment by 160,000 (notably, the OBR attributes more than the 110,000 of this increase to the Chancellor’s policy measures, equivalent to 0.3 percentage points). But over the Parliament as a whole, economic growth is forecast to average just 0.5 per cent a year, the lowest since Margaret Thatcher’s first term in office.`

- On 15 March 2023, The Institute for Government released a report as response to the Spring Budget which said:
    
    > `As anticipated, the chancellor used some of this fiscal space in the near term to keep the energy price guarantee limit at £2,500 per year for the average household, rather than rising to £3,000 as previously planned. This will stay in place until June. From then, energy prices are expected to fall below the guarantee threshold anyway, reflecting a steep fall in wholesale energy prices since the start of the year. Hunt also announced that the charges for those on prepayment meters will be brought in line with those paid by direct debit customers, bringing a welcome end to the premium that those (typically vulnerable) customers currently pay for their energy.  
    >   
    > But it is not all good news. Even with lower energy prices and more government support, real household disposable income is still expected to fall by 6% between 2021/22 and 2023/24, only slightly better than the 7% fall expected in November. UK households are still facing the largest fall in living standards since records began in the 1950s – and they won’t return to their pre-pandemic level until at least 2028, reflecting the impact of the trade shock suffered by the UK since the energy crisis began, on top of structural weaknesses in the economy.`

- On 22 November 2023, Chancellor Hunt announced the Autumn Statement in which revealed a list of economic and fiscal policies. The policy’s included, [link](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/655e107697196d000d985d6b/E02982473_Autumn_Statement_Nov_23_Accessible_v3.pdf)

    > Full Expensing: invest for less made permanent to help boost investment by £20 billion a year
    
    > £4.5 billion investment in manufacturing
    
### Economic Analysis
- On 22 November 2023, The Office of Budget Responsibility released a `Economic and Fiscal Outlook` Report on the Autumn Statement which said:
    
    > `While real GDP growth has been stronger so far this year than we anticipated in March, we expect it to cool over the second half of 2023. Quarterly real GDP growth was 0.3 per cent in the first quarter of 2023 and 0.2 per cent in the second quarter whereas, in March, we expected output to contract by 0.4 per cent over the two quarters. But we think that this unexpected strength will be reversed in the coming quarters. This is because interest rates have risen by more than expected in March which should weigh on activity. Business surveys and consumer confidence measures are also consistent with weak near-term growth. Therefore, we forecast GDP to remain flat in the third quarter of 2023 and only grow by 0.1 per cent in the fourth quarter, below the combined growth of 0.7 per cent we expected in March. This results in an annual growth forecast of only 0.6 per cent in 2023.  
    >   
    > We expect growth to remain subdued at 0.7 per cent in 2024 as a result of weak real wage growth, the effect of past increases in interest rates and fading fiscal support weighing on economic activity. It is plausible that only around half the impact of the past substantial rise in interest rates has yet fed through to the economy, with the rising share of fixed rate mortgages in recent years slowing the pass-through from mortgage rates to household disposable incomes.In our central forecast, growth picks up to 1.4 per cent in 2025 and 2.0 per cent in 2026 and 2027 as inflation falls back from recent elevated rates and provides a further boost to real wage growth. A fading in the effect of past interest rate increases and the outright falls in rates in our conditioning assumptions also push up on GDP growth relative to supply growth. Growth then drops back towards our new estimate of medium-term potential output growth of 1.6 per cent in 2028.`  
    > [link](https://obr.uk/docs/dlm_uploads/E03004355_November-Economic-and-Fiscal-Outlook_Web-Accessible.pdf)
    
    > `There is significant uncertainty around our GDP growth forecast. The left-hand side of Chart 2.10 illustrates our central forecast for real GDP growth within a fan chart. The shaded areas illustrate the probability of different growth outcomes, conditioned on the size of past forecast errors since 1988. These uncertainty bands imply that there is around a 1 in 4 chance that real GDP growth will be negative in the latter half of the forecast and a similar probability that growth will exceed 4 per cent. But, as with our inflation fan chart, this likely understates the uncertainty around our current forecast give the scale and array of risks we currently face. The right-hand panel of Chart 2.10 shows how many of the recent errors around our forecast fall well outside our historic distribution, owing to the shocks of the pandemic and energy crisis. An uncertain outlook for energy prices, inflation, and productivity growth pose particular risks to our forecast. Chapter 5 presents scenarios showing how different paths for inflation and real output growth affect the public finances.` [link](https://obr.uk/docs/dlm_uploads/E03004355_November-Economic-and-Fiscal-Outlook_Web-Accessible.pdf)
    
- On 22 November 2023, The Institute for Fiscal Studies released a response to the Autumn Statement which said:
    
    > `The public finances haven’t meaningfully improved. The growth outlook has weakened. Inflation is expected to stay higher for longer. Higher inflation pushes up tax receipts by more than it pushes up spending on debt interest or social security benefits; but rather than use the proceeds to ease the ongoing ‘fiscal drag’ effects of threshold freezes, or to compensate public services for higher costs, the Chancellor opted to cut other taxes. His immediate cut to National Insurance will put more money into workers’ pockets when it comes in but won’t be enough to prevent this from being the biggest tax-raising parliament in modern times. These cuts will also not stop tax revenues rising to their highest ever levels. The “full expensing” cut to corporation tax is a welcome extension of the temporary cut announced in March and, alongside a slew of other reforms, does indicate that this was an event focused on medium term growth as well as a pre election giveaway.` [link](https://ifs.org.uk/Autumn-Statement-2023-response)
    
    > `Despite some near-term good news on growth this year, the OBR delivered a gloomier outlook for real growth going forward. Annual growth in the economy from 2024 to 2027 is now forecast to average 1.5% per year, compared with 2.1% per year in March. ` [link](https://ifs.org.uk/Autumn-Statement-2023-response)  
    > The headline measures in this Autumn Statement were cuts to the rates of National Insurance Contributions for employees and the self-employed. Taken in isolation, these put money back into the pockets of almost 30 million workers at a cost of around £10 billion per year, with anyone earning at least £12,570, or making profits of at least £6,725, per year benefitting.  
    >   
    > The bigger picture is that these changes give back less than £1 of every £4 that is being taken away from households through changes to NICs and income tax announced since March 2021. Those takeaways are far less transparent than the smaller giveaway announced today - implemented as they are through multi-year freezes to income tax and NICs thresholds, which gradually bring more and more people into higher tax brackets, and especially so at a time of high inflation.`  
    > [link](https://ifs.org.uk/Autumn-Statement-2023-response)
    
    > `Today, the Chancellor made ‘full expensing’ permanent. This allows companies to deduct 100% of qualifying plant and machinery investment immediately when calculating their taxable profits.  
    >   
    > Isaac Delestre, a Research Economist at the IFS, said: “The Chancellor described the change as ‘the biggest business tax cut in modern British history’. It is not. The OBR estimates that the policy will cost almost £11 billion in 2028-29. But the ultimate cost of full expensing is much lower: around £1–3 billion a year (in today’s terms). This is because most of the up-front cost will be recouped in later years: under full expensing, firms deduct investment costs immediately which they would otherwise deduct gradually over time.`  
    > [link](https://ifs.org.uk/Autumn-Statement-2023-response)
    
    > `Higher inflation has led to buoyant tax revenues, but does not automatically feed through into higher departmental budgets, which are fixed in cash terms. That means those budgets are worth less in real terms: they can purchase fewer goods and services. The upshot is that by 2027-28, the OBR estimates that the real value of departmental budgets will have been eroded by £19 billion. The government could have used the tax proceeds from higher inflation to compensate departments. Instead, they announced £20 billion of tax cuts.  
    >   
    > Plans beyond 2025 imply making cuts to some ‘unprotected’ areas (like local government, or prisons) and imply big cuts to the level of public investment. Such are the scale of these planned cuts to investment that even Labour’s £20 billion-a-year boost to green investment might not be enough to offset them. The public finance forecasts are predicated on these tight spending plans being delivered.`

### 2019- Fracking
- In the 2019 Conservative Manifesto, it mentioned not supporting fracking.
    
    > `We placed a moratorium on fracking in England with immediate effect. Having listened to local communities, we have ruled out changes to the planning system. We will not support fracking unless the science shows categorically that it can be done safely.` [link](https://assets-global.website-files.com/5da42e2cae7ebd3f8bde353c/5dda924905da587992a064ba_Conservative%202019%20Manifesto.pdf)
    
- In February 2022 the Oil & Gas Authority ordered the "plugging and abandonment" of Britain's shale wells.
    
    > `The owner of the shale fracking company Cuadrilla will permanently plug and abandon its two shale wells in Lancashire, drawing a line on Britain’s failed fracking industry.  
    >   
    > Cuadrilla set out plans to permanently seal the two shale gas wells drilled at the Preston New Road Lancashire shale exploration site a little over two years after the government brought an end to fracking in England.  
    >   
    > Francis Egan, the chief executive of Cuadrilla, said the government’s oil and gas regulator had ordered the “ridiculous” shutdown of the wells in the northern Bowland Shale gas formation despite Europe’s gas supply crisis.`

- On 22 September 2022, Rees-Mogg defended fracking saying the science is misunderstood.
    
    > `Rees-Mogg insisted fracking in England would drive down global gas prices and that opposition to it was “sheer ludditery”, often based on the public misunderstanding the science.  
    >   
    > “It is safe. It is shown to be safe,” Rees-Mogg said. “The scare stories have been disproved time and again. The hysteria about seismic activity, I think, fails to understand that the Richter scale is a logarithmic scale. People seem to think it is a straight arithmetic scale, which of course it is not.”`  
    > [link](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/sep/22/government-confirms-it-is-lifting-ban-on-fracking-in-england)
    
- On 29 September 2022, Truss made public the idea of acquiring local consent to start with fracking operations.
    
    > `Liz Truss has refused to give details of how local consent would be given for fracking in a particular area, amid growing evidence that it will be pushed through as a national infrastructure project.  
    >   
    > ...  
    >   
    > The presenter Graham Liver asked her: “We are the only area of the country that has done it, and it caused earthquakes, people’s houses shook. Why do you think it is safe to continue, because none of the science has changed?”  
    >   
    > Truss replied: “What I want to be clear about is we will only press ahead with fracking in areas where there is local community support for that … Fracking is carried out perfectly safely in various parts of the world, and the business secretary will make sure that any fracking that takes place is safe.”`

- On 26 October 2022, Sunak during Prime Ministers Question’s said he will reinstate the ban as was committed in the 2019 Manifesto.
    
    > `Rishi Sunak will reinstate the England-wide moratorium on shale gas fracking that was temporarily lifted by his predecessor Liz Truss, a senior government insider has confirmed.  
    >   
    > During his first prime minister’s questions in the House of Commons on Wednesday, the new UK prime minister told MPs that he “stands by” the Conservative party’s 2019 manifesto commitment that halted fracking. The overarching ban was briefly lifted by Truss during her brief period as prime minister.`

### Research Studies
- A 2014 Government Report found that:
    
    > `At present there is limited environmental and health surveillance data within the published literature in relation to existing shale gas extraction operations. There have been very few epidemiological studies and those that have been carried out generally lack robust exposure assessments. A few studies have suggested associations between adverse health impacts and shale gas extraction activities; however, the authors have highlighted a number of limitations within these studies and it is evident that further work is required. The UK has an opportunity, in advance of significant development of shale gas extraction activities, to consider appropriate environmental and epidemiological studies to strengthen the evidence base on potential health impacts. However, the challenge for any investigation is that potential  
    > emissions associated with shale gas extraction activities are generally common to a number of other sources, such as industry and traffic, making it difficult to clearly attribute any exposures to shale gas extraction activities.  
    >   
    > In conclusion, the currently available evidence indicates that the potential risks to public health from exposure to the emissions associated with shale gas extraction will be low if the operations are properly run and regulated. In order to ensure this, regulation needs to be strongly and robustly applied.`

- A 2017 Paper found that:

- A 2018 Paper found that:
    
    > `What we find in this scoping review is that the best information available about human health impacts and HVHF is very limited. At this point, only imperfect information is available: not everyone has access to the same quality of information. For every careful study similar to many of those in this scoping review, there are many highly publicized sources of information that are based on opinion, bias, or self-interest that add nothing to the clinician’s toolkit or ability to make a good judgment. Without quality information about the health impacts of HVHF, primary care providers are limited in their ability to identify the source of patient symptoms as well as in their ability to keep their patients accurately informed about potential risks associated with HVHF.` [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1097/JOM.0000000000001278) - High-Volume Hydraulic Fracturing and Human Health Outcomes: A Scoping Review, Wright and Muma, 2018
    
- A 2019 Systematic Review found that:
    
    > `We found 20 published epidemiologic studies that evaluate potential associations between ONG operations and health outcomes. These studies assessed 32 different health outcomes ranging from self-reported symptoms to confirmed disease diagnoses. Since only a few outcomes were covered by multiple studies, there was insufficient weight of evidence for most health outcomes. We found studies of populations living near ONG operations provide limited evidence (modest scientific findings that support the outcome, but with significant limitations) of harmful health effects including asthma exacerbations and various self-reported symptoms. For all other health outcomes, we found conflicting evidence (mixed), insufficient evidence, or in some cases, a lack of evidence of the possibility for harmful health effects.` [link](https://sci-hub.ee/10.3390/ijerph16122123) - A Systematic Review of the Epidemiologic Literature Assessing Health Outcomes in Populations Living near Oil and Natural Gas Operations: Study Quality and Future Recommendations, Bamber et al., 2019

    >   
    > “This new law imposes serious and undue restrictions on these rights that are neither necessary nor proportionate to achieve a legitimate purpose as defined under international law. This law is wholly unnecessary as UK police already have the powers to act against violent and disruptive demonstrations,” Türk said.  
    >   
    > “It is especially worrying that the law expands the powers of the police to stop and search individuals, including without suspicion; defines some of the new criminal offences in a vague and overly broad manner; and imposes unnecessary and disproportionate criminal sanctions on people organizing or taking part in peaceful protests,” he added.`

### 2022 Rwanda Asylum Plan
### Human Rights
- In the UN Refugee Convention 1951, Article 31 states that refugees cannot be penalised for entering the country illegally to claim asylum.
    
    > `The Contracting States shall not impose penalties, on account of their illegal entry or presence, on refugees who, coming directly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened in the sense of Article 1, enter or are present in their territory without authorization, provided they present themselves without delay to the authorities and show good cause for their illegal entry or presence.` [link](https://www.unhcr.org/libraries/pdf.js/web/viewer.html?file=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.unhcr.org%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Flegacy-pdf%2F4ca34be29.pdf?version1692333666)
    
- On 2 January 2019, immigration lawyer Colin Yeo wrote that under the UN Refugee Convention, there is no obligation on refugees to claim asylum in the first safe country they reach.
    
    > `there is no obligation in the Refugee Convention, either explicit or implicit, to claim asylum in the first safe country reached by a refugees.` [link](https://freemovement.org.uk/are-refugees-obliged-to-claim-asylum-in-the-first-safe-country-they-reach/)
    
### France
- In July 2018, Human Rights Watch found that asylum seekers and migrants in France were not being treated as they should be according to French law.
    
    > `The French Red Cross does age assessments for unaccompanied children in Paris, delegated to do so by the department of Paris (a department is a local administrative division of France), and it has established an evaluation facility (Dispositif d’evaluation des mineurs isolés étrangers, DEMIE) for this purpose. But many children who seek legal recognition of their age report that they are turned away at the door by security guards. Others go through a short interview of approximately five minutes followed by a summary verbal denial. This treatment falls short of what is required by French law, violates international standards, and means that those who are turned away must fend for themselves or seek assistance from nongovernmental organizations to find shelter, food, and other basic necessities.` [link](https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/report_pdf/france0718_web.pdf)
    
    > Article 25 (5) of the Asylum Procedures Directive explicitly addresses age assessments and establishes that they are only appropriate if there doubts about the individual’s age and any continuing doubt about age, is to be resolved in the individual’s favor so they are treated as a child. Therefore, under EU law, age assessments should only be used if there are grounds for serious doubt about an individual’s age, and never as a routine practice. This is consistent with recommendations from other bodies such as the Committee on the Rights of the Child and UNHCR.` [link](https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/report_pdf/france0718_web.pdf)
    
- In June 2020, it was found that 80% of refugees in Calais & Dunkirk had been there for more than 4 years waiting for their refugee application to be complete.
    
    > `A field poll carried out by the French Red Cross in June 2020, of more than 80 people living in makeshift camps around Calais and Dunkirk in Northern France, found it had been more than four years since they were first forced to leave their homes, on average.` [link](https://www.redcross.org.uk/stories/migration-and-displacement/refugees-and-asylum-seekers/5-reasons-people-cross-the-channel)
    
- At the end of 2020, the UK saw a sizable uptick in the number of Asylum Seekers arriving on small boats across the English Channel from Calais & Dunkirk, France.
    
    > `while there was an initial increase in small boats detections in 2019, recorded detections on other routes remained relatively stable. Small boat arrivals increased further in 2020 as detections on other routes declined, likely in part due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic making other methods of entry such as air or ferry less viable. However, in 2021 and 2022, there was a substantial increase in the numbers of small boat arrivals. This occurred despite the other entry methods becoming more viable as global COVID-19 restrictions eased.` [link](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/irregular-migration-to-the-uk-year-ending-december-2022/irregular-migration-to-the-uk-year-ending-december-2022)
    
### Rwanda
- Between 2013 and 2018, Rwanda had a migrant deal with Israel like the Rwandan-UK Migrant deal. Some 4,000 Eritrean and Sudanese asylum seekers based in Israel were sent to Rwanda and Uganda between 2013 and 2018, before the secretive arrangement was abandoned and almost all are thought to have left the country almost immediately, with many attempting to return to Europe via people-smuggling routes.
    
    > `Rwanda signed a similar agreement with Israel between 2014 and 2017 that was not a success, with almost of all of the 4,000 detainees sent there swiftly leaving the country to undertake the perilous journey to Europe, some of whom are understood to have fallen prey to human traffickers en route, notably in Libya.` [[u]]
    
    > `Then-minister of interior Gideon Sa’ar, announces that Israel has signed agreements with “third countries”, and that the departure of “infiltrators” to these countries has begun in limited numbers. According to the Population and Immigration Authority, 1,093 asylum seekers were deported to third countries during 2014.` [link](https://hotline.org.il/en/refugees-and-asylum-seekers-en/voluntary-departure/)
    
    > the state admitted for the first time that no operative procedure to forcibly deport asylum seekers from Israel exists; thus, beginning on April 17 (2018), the ministry of interior ceased holding pre-deportation hearings, and now declared that all deportation notices previously given are obsolete. It was further declared that “infiltrators” whose visa expired – will have it renewed for a period of 60 days, as was the norm before the deportation. Additionally, it was clarified that the “voluntary departure” route to a third country is still available, and will be offered to every asylum seekers during his or her visa renewal, though the renewal of the visa will not be conditioned upon it.` [link](https://hotline.org.il/en/refugees-and-asylum-seekers-en/voluntary-departure/)
    
    > `These asylum seekers are sent to Uganda and Rwanda with a promise from the Israeli authorities that they will be provided with the necessary papersto enable them to stay legally in the receiving country. However, our findings show that, in reality, they do not receive any legal status: they are left with no valid legal documents upon arrival and are either encouraged to leave these countries, live below the radar and without legal status, and/or hide the fact that they came from Israel.  
    >   
    > For those asylum seekers who are sent to Rwanda, testimonies collected by IRRI suggest that the majority, if not all, are being smuggled out of the country by land to Kampala within days of arriving in Kigali. They are not given an opportunity to apply for asylum, and even if they wish to stay in Rwanda, their refugee claims cannot be assessed as the national refugee status determination committee has not yet been established. These transfers appear to be coordinated by the people who receive the asylum seekers at Kigali airport. From Kampala, the majority travel north to South Sudan, Sudan and Libya, with many ultimately risking crossing the Mediterranean or falling into the hands of the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) in the hope of finding safety in Europe.`  
    > [link](https://www.refworld.org/pdfid/55ee8c3a4.pdf)
    
- On 8 July 2021, The UK's International Ambassador for Human Rights Rita French, delivered a statement during the Universal Periodic Review Adoption for Rwanda condemning Human Rights abuses.
    
    > `The UK is pleased that Rwanda fully supports our recommendation to protect and enable journalists to work freely, without fear of retribution, and ensure that State authorities comply with the access to information law. This is an important step to promote freedom of speech, including allowing space for critical voices.  
    >   
    > We regret that Rwanda did not support our recommendation, which was also made by other States, to conduct transparent, credible and independent investigations into allegations of human rights violations including deaths in custody and torture.  
    >   
    > We welcome that Rwanda accepted recommendations from other countries on combatting human trafficking, but we were disappointed that Rwanda did not support the UK recommendation to screen, identify and provide support to trafficking victims, including those held in Government transit centres. In recognising the progress made by Rwanda, the UK encourages Rwanda to submit an optional mid-term report to provide an update on implementation of recommendations, between reviews.`

- In the Human Rights Watch - World Report 2021, Rwanda is described by many abuses of human rights involving political suppression, poorly treated detainees and unfair application of judicial practice amongst others.
    
    > `The ruling Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) continued to target those perceived as a threat to the government during 2020. Several high-profile government critics were arrested or threatened. Authorities failed to conduct credible investigations into the suspicious death in police custody of well-known singer and activist, Kizito Mihigo, in February.  
    >   
    > Arbitrary detention, ill-treatment, and torture in official and unofficial detention facilities continued. Fair trial standards were routinely flouted in many sensitive political cases, in which security-related charges are often used to prosecute prominent government critics.`  
    > [link](https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2021/country-chapters/rwanda)
    
### The Plan
- On 14 April 2022, the Home Secretary Priti Patel announced a new plan to send refugees entering the UK to Rwanda to complete their asylum applications.
    
    > `The government has today (Thursday 14 April) set out bold new plans to tackle illegal migration, control our borders and crack down on the criminal gangs exploiting this international crisis.` [link](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/world-first-partnership-to-tackle-global-migration-crisis)
    
    > `Under this Partnership the UK is investing £120 million into the economic development and growth of Rwanda. Funding will also be provided to support the delivery of asylum operations, accommodation and integration, similar to the costs incurred in the UK for these services.` [link](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/world-first-partnership-to-tackle-global-migration-crisis)
    
    > `Alongside this action, which will disrupt the business model of people-smuggling gangs, the military will also now take operational command of responding to small boats in the Channel, in partnership with Border Force. This will happen with immediate effect, and be backed up by £50 million in new funding. This change will deliver new boats, aerial surveillance and expert military personnel. In doing so it will bolster Border Force teams and their existing patrol vessels and provide a Wildcat helicopter.` [link](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/world-first-partnership-to-tackle-global-migration-crisis)
    
    > `Finally, to address the unacceptable, £4.7 million per-day cost to the taxpayer from housing migrants in hotels (including those who have arrived through resettlement programmes), we will be introducing a new, nationwide dispersal system so asylum pressures are more equally spread across local authorities. We will also shortly open a new, bespoke, asylum reception centre in Linton-on-Ouse.` [link](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/world-first-partnership-to-tackle-global-migration-crisis)
    
- On 14 April 2022, Johnson defended the plan and called Rwanda one of the safest countries in the world.
    
    > `speaking at an airport in Kent, the Prime Minister said: “I just want to say something about Rwanda because I think there’s a risk of stereotyping here.  
    >   
    > “Rwanda has totally transformed over the last few decades, it’s a very, very different country from what it was.  
    >   
    > “This is not something that we’ve put together overnight, this has been nine months in preparation. So I would urge people not to think in a blinkered way about Rwanda.”  
    >   
    > He added: “Let’s be clear, Rwanda is one of the safest countries in the world, globally recognised for its record of welcoming and integrating migrants.”`  
    > [[rwandaborisjohnsongovern]]
    
- On 14 April 2022, The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) expressed she is firmly opposed to the policy saying the plan violates international law.
    
    > `“UNHCR remains firmly opposed to arrangements that seek to transfer refugees and asylum seekers to third countries in the absence of sufficient safeguards and standards. Such arrangements simply shift asylum responsibilities, evade international obligations, and are contrary to the letter and spirit of the Refugee Convention,” said UNHCR’s Assistant High Commissioner for Protection, Gillian Triggs.` [[unrefuge]]
    
- On 15 April 2022, it was reported that The Rwandan Government were seemingly unaware of the policy before its announcement.
    
    > `Victoire Ingabire said: "The population has woken up to the deal that has been signed - nobody knew about it.”  
    >   
    > "We're not ready," she added.  
    >   
    > "Because if our people don't have enough to eat, if our kids or Rwanda's kids don't have the possibility of going to school because of the poverty, how will the Rwandan government give education to the kids of refugees?"`

- On 14 June 2022, The European Court of Human Rights grounded the first scheduled flight to Rwanda, of which had 7 refugees onboard.
    
    > `Boris Johnson’s plan to send an inaugural flight of asylum seekers to Rwanda has been abandoned after a dramatic 11th-hour ruling by the European court of human rights.  
    >   
    > Up to seven people who had come to the UK seeking refuge had been expected to be removed to the east African country an hour and a half before the flight was due to take off.  
    >

### 2023 Illegal Migration Bill
- On 7 March 2023, Sunak announced plans to introduce new laws to help tackle the small boats coming from France.
    
    > `Earlier this year the Prime Minister made stopping the boats one of his 5 promises to the British people. The ‘Stop the Boats’ – or Illegal Migration – Bill will fulfil that promise by ending illegal entry as a route to asylum in the UK.  
    >   
    > This will remove the incentive for people to risk their lives through these dangerous and unnecessary journeys and pull the rug from under the criminal gangs profiting from this misery once and for all.  
    >   
    > ...  
    >   
    > Summary of bill measures:  
    >   
    > duty to make arrangements for removal - the Home Secretary will have a legal duty to remove people who have entered the UK illegally  
    >   
    > detention and bail - strengthening detention powers so people can only apply for bail from the courts (First-tier Tribunal) after 28 days (although habeus corpus will remain)  
    >   
    > unaccompanied children - minors who come to the UK illegally will not be removed to a safe third country until adulthood, except in limited circumstances  
    >   
    > entry, citizenship and settlement - people who come to the UK illegally will be prevented from settling in the country and will face a permanent ban from returning  
    >   
    > asylum - people who come here illegally will have their asylum claims deemed inadmissible and considered in a safe third country  
    >   
    > modern slavery - modern slavery referrals for those who come to the UK illegally will be disqualified under public order grounds under the terms of the international anti-trafficking treaty, ECAT  
    >   
    > legal proceedings - limiting the circumstances in which legal challenges will prevent someone from being removed from the UK, most legal challenges will be considered when someone has been successfully removed from the UK  
    >   
    > expanding the list of countries that are considered safe in law - this will make it unquestionably clear when someone doesn’t need our protection because they are obviously not at risk of persecution in their home country  
    >   
    > annual number of people using safe and legal routes - committing to resettling a specific number of refugees in the UK every year`  
    > [link](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/ground-breaking-new-laws-to-stop-the-boats)
    
- On the first page of the `as introduced` version of the bill, it states that Braverman could not guarantee that the bill was compatible with the European Court of Human Rights' laws.
    
    > `Secretary Suella Braverman has made the following statement under section 19(1)(b) of the Human Rights Act 1998:  
    >   
    > I am unable to make a statement that, in my view, the provisions of the Illegal Migration Bill are compatible with the Convention rights, but the Government nevertheless wishes the House to proceed with the Bill.`  
    > [link](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-03/0262/220262.pdf)
    
- On 7 March 2023, The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) expressed she is firmly opposed to the policy saying the plan amounts to an asylum ban.
    
    > `UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, is profoundly concerned by the asylum bill introduced by the UK Government to the House of Commons today. In its current form, the Bill compels the Home Secretary to deny access to the UK asylum system to those who arrive irregularly. Rather than being provided with protection, these asylum-seekers would instead be subject to detention in the UK, while arrangements are pursued to remove them to another country.  
    >   
    > The legislation, if passed, would amount to an asylum ban – extinguishing the right to seek refugee protection in the United Kingdom for those who arrive irregularly, no matter how genuine and compelling their claim may be, and with no consideration of their individual circumstances.  
    >   
    > The effect of the bill (in this form) would be to deny protection to many asylum-seekers in need of safety and protection, and even deny them the opportunity to put forward their case. This would be a clear breach of the Refugee Convention and would undermine a longstanding, humanitarian tradition of which the British people are rightly proud.`  
    > [link](https://www.unhcr.org/uk/news/press/2023/3/6407794e4/statement-on-uk-asylum-bill.html)
    
- On 7 March 2023, Braverman stated the bill attempts to stretch the boundaries of international law and that there is a more than 50% chance that the bill is not compatible with the ECHR.
    
    > `Suella Braverman has admitted the government is attempting to push “the boundaries of international law” with legislation aimed at reducing small boat crossings in the Channel.` [link](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/07/suella-braverman-small-boats-plan-push-boundaries-international-law-rishi-sunak)
    
    > `when introducing a bill for its second reading before the House of Commons, a minister must tell MPs that they are either confident it is compatible with the ECHR or that they are unable to say it is compatible but they wish to proceed with it anyway.  
    >   
    > When introducing the Illegal Migration Bill, Suella Braverman opted for the latter, telling MPs "that there is a more than 50% chance" that provisions in the new law "may not be compatible".`

### 2021 `Coronavirus: lessons learned to date` Report
- On 21 September 2021, the House of Commons Health and Social Care, and Science and Technology Committee’s released a `Coronavirus: lessons learned to date`. [link](https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/7496/documents/78687/default/) which included:
    
    > Conclusion: `We must ensure that the UK learns from its experience of covid-19 and does not repeat mistakes in the future. We have therefore identified a number of consistent themes in our conclusions and recommendations in this Report, including that:  
    >   
    > a) the UK’s response, with the notable exception of vaccine development and deployment, has for the most part been too reactive as opposed to anticipatory;  
    >   
    > b) there has been too little explicit learning from the international experience, as illustrated in the approach to non-pharmaceutical interventions and test and trace;  
    >   
    > c) the right combination needs to be struck between centralised and localised measures and in certain cases implementation of pandemic containment measures was too centralised when it ought to have been more decentralised;  
    >   
    > better engagement with relevant sectors and interest groups was needed to understand on-the-ground experience and inform decision making, particularly for social care; and  
    >   
    > d) the response has lacked speed in making timely decisions.`  
    
    > `The operation of COBR was not well-suited to the modern demands of a pandemic response. It is especially concerning that its culture of confidentiality was considered by some to be so unreliable that alternative meetings were arranged that could command greater confidentiality among participants.`
    
    > `The Civil Contingencies Secretariat did not have adequate resources to maintain a substantial standing capability to survey the development of potential threats, and it had a limited reach into the range of Government departments required to respond to a pandemic. The experience has been that this investment in resilience is at risk of being trumped by the day-to-day pressures of Government.`
    
    > `Protocols to share data between public bodies involved in the response were too slow to establish and to become functional. This was especially true in the data flows from national to local government.`
    
    > `The NHS responded quickly and strongly to the demands of the pandemic, but compared to other health systems it “runs hot”—with little spare capacity built in to cope with sudden and unexpected surges of demand such as in a pandemic.`
    
    > `Partly because it was set up too late, NHS Test and Trace ultimately fell short of the expectations set for it. It has failed to make a significant enough impact on the course of the pandemic to justify the level of public investment it received. It clearly failed on its own terms, given its aim in September to “avoid the need for a second lockdown” by contributing to a reduction in the ‘R’ number. While we acknowledge that test, trace and isolate activities are just one—albeit crucial—component of the measures undertaken to tackle covid-19, NHS Test and Trace (NHSTT) clearly failed to achieve this central objective. NHSTT has also consistently failed to reach the 72-hour turnaround time as identified as necessary by SAGE, including a significant failure in September 2020. Further, although the Government first described the impact of NHSTT on reducing ‘R’ in December, it took an unacceptably long two months before the evidence and analysis behind this assertion was made public. When it was published it became clear that the analysis was outdated, invalidating claims made at the time. The use of inaccurate data and the lack of transparency impeded effective public scrutiny at a crucial time in the pandemic.`
    
    > `The success of the vaccine programme has redeemed many of the persistent failings of other parts of the national response such as the test and trace system, so that the outcome is far better than would have been the case without this success.`
    
### 2019- `40 New Hospitals` Manifesto Pledge
- On 24 November 2019, in the 2019 Conservative Party Manifesto, they pledged to build 40 new hospitals and upgrade 20 by 2030.
    
    > `We will build and fund 40 new hospitals over the next 10 years. This is on top of the 20 hospital upgrades announced in the summer.` [link](https://assets-global.website-files.com/5da42e2cae7ebd3f8bde353c/5dda924905da587992a064ba_Conservative%202019%20Manifesto.pdf)
    
- On 2 October 2020, Johnson announced funding for the manifesto pledge.
    
    > `The Prime Minister today confirmed for the first time that 40 hospitals will be built by 2030 as part of a package worth £3.7 billion, with 8 further new schemes invited to bid, delivering on the government’s manifesto commitment.  
    >   
    > New standards will be developed over the coming months to help standardise the design of new hospitals and make use of modular construction methods to speed up the build.  
    >   
    > The health infrastructure plan (HIP) is the biggest hospital building programme in a generation. It launched last September with a £2.8 billion investment that gave 6 new hospitals the funding to go ahead, alongside seed funding for trusts to work up business cases.`  
    > [link](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-confirms-37-billion-for-40-hospitals-in-biggest-hospital-building-programme-in-a-generation)
    
- On 4 February 2023, The Observer reported that 25% of that hospitals secured full planning permission.
    
    > `Only a quarter of the 40 hospital construction projects that were at the heart of Boris Johnson’s 2019 general election manifesto have secured full planning permission, the Observer can reveal, amid angry claims from NHS figures that there is no chance the schemes will be delivered on time.  
    >   
    > Ministers have repeatedly claimed that the hospitals will be delivered by 2030, despite concerns from health chiefs and economists that “woefully insufficient” funding and rising costs will scupper the plan and put NHS capacity at risk.  
    >   
    > However, an investigation by the Observer has revealed that only 10 of the 40 projects have the full planning permissions they need to go ahead. Those involved in some of the projects said they had already faced lengthy delays, leaving them with decrepit and often unusable buildings.  
    >   
    > “There’s a 0% chance there’s going to be 40 new hospitals by 2030,” said the boss of one of the NHS trusts awaiting a new hospital. “We’ll be moderately lucky to have eight. At the moment we’re doing loads of maintenance work on an ongoing basis, trying to sort out roofs and theatres and all those things. Some hospitals are literally falling down.”  
    >   
    > Analysis by the Observer, combined with official data obtained by the Lib Dem deputy leader, Daisy Cooper, reveals that some projects only have outline planning permission, which is insufficient to allow building work to commence. Many of the projects have no planning permission at all.`

    > `The Conservatives' 2019 election pledge to build 40 new hospitals by 2030 faces a review by the government's spending watchdog. Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting asked for an investigation into delays surrounding the programme and warned of taxpayers' money being wasted. The National Audit Office (NAO) intends to conduct a "value for money review" later this year, its comptroller said. Mr Streeting accused the Tories of "overpromising and underdelivering".` [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-62025410)

## Voting Policy
### 2022 Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Act
- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_and_Calling_of_Parliament_Act_2022](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_and_Calling_of_Parliament_Act_2022)
- The Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Act 2022 is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that repealed the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 and reinstated the prior constitutional situation, by reviving the prerogative powers of the monarch to dissolve and summon parliament. As the monarch exercises this power at the request of the prime minister, this restored the power of the prime minister to have a general election called at a time of their choosing.
### 2022 Elections Act
- The Elections Act 2022 is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, introduced to the House of Commons in July 2021, and receiving Royal Assent on 28 April 2022. The Act introduces voter photo identification for in-person voting to Great Britain for the first time. [link](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3020\#timeline)
- This act now adds a requirement for a `specified document` to complete in-person voting.
    
    > `In this rule a “specified document” also means any of the following documents (in whatever form issued to the holder)—  
    >   
    > (a) a driving licence;  
    > (b) a birth certificate;  
    > (c) a marriage or civil partnership certificate;  
    > (d) an adoption certificate;  
    > (e) the record of a decision on bail made in respect of the voter in accordance with section 5(1) of the Bail Act 1976;  
    > (f) a bank or building society cheque book;  
    > (g) a mortgage statement dated within 3 months of the date of the poll;  
    > (h) a bank or building society statement dated within 3 months of the date of the poll;  
    > (i) a credit card statement dated within 3 months of the date of the poll;  
    > (j) a council tax demand letter or statement dated within 12 months of the date of the poll;  
    > (k) a P45 or P60 form dated within 12 months of the date of the poll;

    > (q) a workplace ID card;  
    > (r) a student ID card;  
    > (s) an 18+ student Oyster photocard;  
    > (t) a National Rail Railcard;  
    > (u) a Young Scot National Entitlement Card.”`  
    > [link](https://bills.parliament.uk/publications/46302/documents/1760)
    
- On 13 December 2021, A House of Commons Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee Report on the Elections Bill had a section called `Concerns regarding the impact of introducing mandatory voter ID` which included that:
    
    > `Professor James highlighted that in the first election following the introduction of a photographic voter ID requirement in Northern Ireland, it is estimated that 25,000 voters, about 2.3% of the electorate, did not vote as a result. He said he thought the 2.3% figure was a reasonable expectation for the number of people who would not vote at elections following the introduction of voter ID. To extrapolate this data and apply it to a UK general election would mean that approximately 1.1 million people would not vote in such an election as a result of the introduction of a mandatory voter ID requirement, and as the Government’s own research indicates, this would not fall evenly across the population. Professor James also pointed out that while it is often said that things are working well in Northern Ireland, “there has not been a detailed systematic evaluation of the situation since the initial introduction of photographic ID”.` [link](https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/8194/documents/83775/default/)
    > 
    > > 7 September 2021: `Rachel Hopkins: First to Professor James and then Jess Garland and any others who want to come in. Other minority groups have expressed concerns to us regarding potential disenfranchisement and prevention of being able to vote. What level of disenfranchisement is likely with the Government’s proposals in this Bill across a range of groups?  
    > >   
    > > Professor James: That is a great question. The terminology “disenfranchisement” is often used. I think it is clear from the case of Northern Ireland that 2.3% of the population had additional things they had to do to go and cast their ballot, which meant that they did not take part in that election. Scaled up for a UK parliamentary election, that is something in the order of 1.1 million people. As we have heard already, the Government’s own research points to how it does not fall evenly across the population. We have already heard about the elderly. The Government’s own research points to unemployed citizens, those with severe disability and those without qualifications being less likely to have identification. I think that trans and gender non-conforming individuals is a particularly vulnerable group in this process and the Government’s research is that they are much less likely to have a form of ID. There are multiple groups that could be adversely affected, but broadly speaking 2.3% sounds like a reasonable expectation.  
    > >   
    > > Dr Garland: There are the groups that Toby mentioned and the Electoral Commission research backs that up. It is people who are unemployed, people who are renting from their council, people who have a disability who are more likely not to have the ID. We also know from the Government’s research that 42% of those people who don’t have ID say they would not apply for the free elector card, so that is clearly not going to solve the problems here. It is not just whether people have ID. Other people have said it is whether this has a chilling effect. People who are already hesitant to take part in the system might feel like this is just one step too far and might not feel welcome and that is a real concern. I want to pick up on the point from the Government research about 2% of people not having any form of ID. That includes unrecognisable ID, if you just have that is out of date and unrecognisable ID is allowed. If you say ID has to be recognisable that increases to 4% of people don’t have the right ID, which is a huge number of people across the population. I think a legitimate question right now is are we saying the scheme includes unrecognisable photos as well and just picking up on the point made earlier about the pressure put on staff in the polling stations.`  
    > > [link](https://committees.parliament.uk/oralevidence/2655/html/)
    
    > `Age UK raised concerns that a voter ID requirement would cause particular difficulties for older people. Angela Kitching, Head of External Affairs at Age UK highlighted that the Government’s own research found that 6% of people over 70 years old would have problems presenting the right kind of ID. Added to this, she said Age UK had concerns  
    > that the Government’s research had excluded 500,000 people in situational care homes and sheltered accommodation. She went on to tell us:  
    >   
    > These are not marginal figures. They are really significant numbers of older people and, to be honest, it is already not particularly easy for a lot of older people to get out to vote.`  
    
- On 21 February 2022, the Electoral Commission, While the bill was still being passed, wrote to government ministers urging for the independence of the commission to be retained.
    
    > `It is our firm and shared view that the introduction of a Strategy and Policy Statement – enabling the Government to guide the work of the Commission – is inconsistent with the role that an independent electoral commission plays in a healthy democracy. This independence is fundamental to maintaining confidence and legitimacy in our electoral system.`
    
    > `The Statement has no precedent in the accountability arrangements of electoral commissions in other comparable democracies, such as Canada, Australia or New Zealand. Indeed, the Code of Good Practice in Electoral Matters of the Venice Commission, of which the UK is a member, states that “Only transparency, impartiality and independence from political motivated manipulation will ensure proper administration of the election process”.`
    
    > `We therefore urge the Government to think again about these measures, to remove the provisions, and to work with the Commission and Speaker’s Committee to ensure that suitable accountability arrangements are in place to ensure confidence across the political spectrum. Strong accountability is essential for this, but so too is demonstrable independence. The Commission’s independent role in the electoral system must be clear for voters and campaigners to see, and preserved in electoral law.`

    > `In the footage, Mr Cruddas is heard discussing what access different size donations would get.  
    >   
    > "Two hundred grand to 250 is Premier League… what you would get is, when we talk about your donations the first thing we want to do is get you at the Cameron/Osborne dinners," he says.  
    >   
    > "You do really pick up a lot of information and when you see the Prime Minister, you're seeing David Cameron, not the Prime Minister.  
    >   
    > "But within that room everything is confidential - you can ask him practically any question you want.

    >   
    > In his resignation statement last night the senior Conservative official responsible for collecting donations for the party said he deeply regretted the repercussions of his "bluster" during the recorded conversations. He added: "Clearly there is no question of donors being able to influence policy or gain undue access to politicians. Specifically, it was categorically not the case that I could offer, or that David Cameron would consider, any access as a result of a donation. Similarly, I have never knowingly even met anyone from the Number 10 policy unit.`

    >   
    > In a chaotic day, which saw Downing Street embark on a series of U-turns, the Conservative party announced that the controversial donor Lord Ashcroft headed a list of millionaire supporters invited to Chequers over the past two years.  
    >   
    > Hours earlier the Tories admitted that the prime minister hosted a "thank you dinner" in Downing Street in July 2010 for six donors and their wives, plus the Tory co-chair Lord Feldman of Elstree, who have donated a total of £18m to the party. The Chequers donors have given the party a further £5m.  
    >

    >   
    > He complained they meant that, in return for cash donations to the Conservative party, he corruptly offered for sale the opportunity to influence government policy and gain unfair advantage through secret meetings with the prime minister and other senior ministers.  
    >   
    > During the litigation, the court of appeal ruled that "corruptly" meant in a way that was "inappropriate, unacceptable and wrong and gave rise to an impression of impropriety".`

### Chakrabarti Inquiry
- [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chakrabarti_Inquiry)
- On 30 June 2016, Shami Chakrabarti’s inquiry presented its findings stating that although antisemitism and other types of racism were not endemic within Labour.
    
    > `my key recommendations are as follows:  
    >   
    > 1. Epithets such as "Paki", "Zio" and others should have no place in Labour Party discourse going forward.  
    >   
    > 2. Critical and abusive reference to any particular person or group based on actual or perceived physical characteristics cannot be tolerated.  
    >   
    > 3. Racial or religious tropes and stereotypes about any group of people should have no place in our modern Labour Party.  
    >   
    > 4. Labour members should resist the use of Hitler, Nazi and Holocaust metaphors, distortions and comparisons in debates about Israel-Palestine in particular.  
    >   
    > 5. Excuse for, denial, approval or minimisation of the Holocaust and attempts to blur responsibility for it have no place in the Labour Party.  
    >   
    > 6. Beliefs out-with the Labour Party's values are not to be protected when considering whether a member has acted in a way which is prejudicial or grossly detrimental to the party.  
    >   
    > 7. The Code of Conduct approved in May 2016 should be amended so as to comprehensively rule out all forms of prejudice, but in the light of this and the guidance in my Report, I do not find other substantive (as opposed to procedural) rule changes to be strictly necessary.  
    >   
    > 8. I recommend procedural rule changes (a draft is annexed to this Report) to improve the Party's disciplinary process (as well as a wider review of the relevant provisions of the rules and procedural guidelines in the light of those recommendations) and the adoption and publication of a complaints procedure.  
    >   
    > 9. I recommend the appointment of a General Counsel to the Labour Party and additional and appropriately expert staff.  
    >   
    > 10. I recommend that the power of interim suspension be vested in the NCC and give guidance as to how it might be exercised more proportionately.  
    >   
    > 11. I recommend the appointment of a Legal Panel of volunteer lawyers of standing so as to assist the NCC in its functions and to provide a review on procedural and proportionality grounds in cases of suspension or expulsion from the Party.  
    >   
    > 12. I recommend consideration of a greater range of NCC sanctions short of suspension and expulsion.  
    >   
    > 13. I do not recommend lifetime bans from the Labour Party and recommend time limits on the bringing of disciplinary charges.  
    >   
    > 14. Once my Report is disseminated and so as to give members an opportunity to be guided by it, I recommend a moratorium on triggering new investigations into matters of relevant language and conduct arising before publication. This in no way effects investigations and disciplinary proceedings already in train.  
    >   
    > 15. I recommend the formation of an NEC working group into comprehensive education and training needs across the Party with a view to partnership with Trade Unions and Higher Education providers. Staff and members involved in the new disciplinary process should receive appropriate training.  
    >   
    > 16. I recommend a review of the Party's Equal Opportunities Policies with a view to adopting an over-arching Equal Opportunities Policy.  
    >   
    > 17. I recommend better dissemination and explanation of the Party's Rule Book.  
    >   
    > 18. I recommend that the NEC gives urgent attention to any parts of the country that have been under "special measures" for more than six months.  
    >   
    > 19. I recommend that no part of the Party should be subject to "special measures" for more than six months without NEC review of that decision. Further the NEC must provide a plan as to how the local party is to improve its practice and return to full democratic rights within the Party.  
    >   
    > 20. The Party should increase the ethnic diversity of its staff.`

    > `Finally, the following findings should be emphasised:  
    >   
    > 1. There is no evidence that, at any point in GLU’s history, antisemitism complaints were treated differently to any other complaints – the problems outlined affected all complaints about whatsoever subject. Whilst the \#MeToo movement and allegations concerning MPs involved in sexual harassment led to a new specifically-tailored process for such complaints, a new specific process was then introduced for antisemitism complaints too.  
    >   
    > 2. There is also no evidence that any individual working for the Labour Party, former or current, has been motivated by antisemitic intent, nor that any complaints were ever treated less favourably because they came from a Jewish complainant or were concerned with allegations of antisemitism.  
    >   
    > 3. There is evidence that the lack of robust processes, systems, training, education and effective line management had a significant impact upon the thorough, consistent and expedient handling of all complaints. There is also evidence that there was previously much larger scope for human error, without safeguards in place to allow for correction of them.  
    >   
    > 4. The evidence demonstrates that, particularly from spring 2018 onwards, the Party has introduced appropriate processes, systems, training, education and effective line management to ensure antisemitism complaints are dealt with swiftly and robustly. These safeguards ensure that the past mistakes in the handling of antisemitism complaints cannot be repeated now.  
    >   
    > We believe this report demonstrates an unprecedented level of openness, honesty and transparency in confronting our own past shortcomings. Our overriding objective regardless of anything else is to eradicate the virus of antisemitism from our Party and make our Party a safe and welcoming home for Jewish members.`

### 2017-18 Nadine Dorries, Asking Ministers about the EU Customs Union While Advocating to Leave
- On 27 January 2018, BuzzFeed News reported that on 10 October 2017, Dorries admits a lack of knowledge about the EU Customs Union trading relationships during Brexit discussions with a politics teacher.
    
    > `WhatsApp messages seen by BuzzFeed News show Nadine Dorries saying she'd been talking with a politics teacher about Brexit and didn't know enough about the trading relationships of the customs union's members to argue the point.  
    >   
    > Nadine Dorries has been among the Tories’ punchiest advocates of a “hard” Brexit – arguing for Philip Hammond to be sacked, calling Dominic Grieve "treacherous", and telling colleagues lobbying for a soft departure from the European Union that they deserve to lose their seats.  
    >   
    > But WhatsApp messages seen by BuzzFeed News reveal that Dorries needed to be convinced by colleagues about one of the eurosceptics’ firmest red lines: that Britain must withdraw from the customs union when it leaves the European Union in 2019.  
    >   
    > As the Brexit talks reached a critical stage in October, Dorries messaged fellow Tory MPs in the European Research Group questioning one of the influential Brexit-backing group's articles of faith. "Is there any reason why, if countries outside of the EU are in the CU, we can't remain in the CU going forward?" the MP for Mid Bedfordshire wrote at 7:28am on 10 October last year.  
    >   
    > Kemi Badenoch, one of the Tories' rising stars, replied minutes later, reminding Dorries of the ERG's position: Britain won’t be free to strike its own trade deals with countries such as the US unless it withdraws fully from the EU’s customs union.  
    >   
    > "But, other countries who are members of the CU do," Dorries replied. "That's why I asked. Do they have exceptions? This was a question in a discussion last night. I need to find out what countries are members and have free trade agreements with other countries first."`

The Commons Select Committee on Standards recommended Paterson be suspended from the Commons for 30 sitting days.
    
    > `The Committee found that Mr Paterson’s actions were an egregious case of paid advocacy, that he repeatedly used his privileged position to benefit two companies for whom he was a paid consultant, and that this has brought the House into disrepute. In line with previous cases of a similar severity, the Committee recommends that Mr Paterson be suspended from the service of the House for 30 sitting days.` [link](https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/290/committee-on-standards/news/158246/committee-on-standards-publish-report-on-the-conduct-of-rt-hon-owen-paterson-mp/)
    
    > `I have found that Mr Paterson acted in breach of paragraph 11 of the 2015 Code of Conduct, which prohibits paid advocacy, in respect of approaches he made to the FSA and DfID. Mr Paterson has told me that he was acting as a “whistle-blower” under the exemption provided in paragraph 9 of Chapter 3 of the Guide to the Rules. I accept that he was entitled to this exemption in respect of the approach he made in November 2016, and the meeting he attended on 15 November 2016. But I do not accept that he was entitled to this exemption in his follow up meetings and correspondence as these were intended to benefit his clients rather than to raise a serious wrong.  
    >   
    > I consider that Mr Paterson was not entitled to the whistle-blowing exemption, and therefore breached paragraph 11 of the Code in his approaches to the FSA, on behalf of Lynn’s and to DfID on behalf of Randox as these were also intended to benefit his clients rather than to raise a serious wrong. He also brought no evidence to FSA and DfID about serious wrongs.  
    >   
    > Mr Paterson has stated that when addressing a serious wrong, the rules on lobbying do not apply. This is not the case. By Mr Paterson’s application of the rules, any Member dealing with a serious matter could use that as a platform to benefit a company by whom they are paid. The correct interpretation of the rule is that it allows a Member to bring evidence of a serious wrong or substantial injustice to the responsible Minister or official, even if it would have the incidental effect of conferring a financial or material benefit on the organisation which paid him or her. Mr Paterson was seeking benefit for his clients. In those circumstances that benefit to his clients would not be ‘incidental’ but an intended outcome of the approach.`

    > `Paterson, a former Northern Ireland secretary and prominent Brexit campaigner, claimed the investigation was biased and “offends against the basic standard of procedural fairness that no one should be found guilty until they have had a chance to be heard and to present their evidence including their witnesses”. He said Stone did not speak to him to get his side of the story until after she had “made up her mind” and did not seek oral evidence from 17 witnesses who wanted to testify in his support. “I am not guilty and a fair process would exonerate me,” he added.` [link](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/oct/26/owen-paterson-faces-suspension-breaking-lobbying-rules)

- On 15 February 2022, The High Court also ruled illegal the Prime Minister's appointment of Dido Harding, Penrose's wife, to Chair the National Institute for Health Protection, overseeing the Test and Trace initiative. [link](https://goodlawproject.org/update/dido-harding-mike-coupe-unlawful/)
    
    > `In a landmark verdict, the High Court has today found that the process leading to the appointments of both Dido Harding and Mike Coupe were unlawful. It held that Matt Hancock broke the law in appointing Dido Harding as Chair of the National Institute for Health Protection (NIHP) and in appointing Mike Coupe as Director of Testing at Test and Trace (NHSTT). The High Court was also clear that the Prime Minister broke the law in appointing Dido Harding as Chair of Test and Trace.  
    >   
    > The Court declared: “The Secretary of State for Health and Social Care did not comply with the Public Sector Equality Duty in section 149 of the Equality Act 2010 in relation to the decisions on how to appoint (i) Baroness Harding as Interim Chair of the National Institute of Health Protection in August 2020 and (ii) Mike Coupe as Director of Testing for NHS Test and Trace in September 2020.”`

### 2020-21 Priti Patel, Bullying Report Leading To Alex Allan, Johnson’s 1st Ethics Adviser’s Resignation
- On 20 February 2020, Patel came under scrutiny for trying to "force out" Sir Philip Rutnam, the most senior civil servant in her department.
    
    > `Priti Patel has attempted to oust her most senior civil servant after a toxic clash at the top of the Home Office. Multiple sources inside the department have accused the home secretary of bullying, belittling officials in meetings, making unreasonable demands and creating an “atmosphere of fear”. Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, has been dragged into the row after Ms Patel demanded the removal of her permanent secretary, Sir Philip Rutnam. Sir Philip is understood to have raised concerns about Ms Patel’s behaviour within the Cabinet Office. A senior Whitehall source said that the situation had become “completely unsustainable and was going to blow up”. [link](https://archive.ph/mped2)
    
- On 29 February 2020, Sir Philip Rutnam resigned saying he would sue the government for constructive dismissal and that he did not believe Patel's assertion that she had been uninvolved in an alleged campaign briefing against him.
    
    > `The top civil servant in the Home Office has resigned and said he intends to claim for constructive dismissal by the government. Sir Philip Rutnam said there had been a "vicious and orchestrated" campaign against him in Home Secretary Priti Patel's office.` [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51687287)
    
- On 20 November 2020, a Cabinet Office inquiry by Sir Alex Allan found evidence that Patel had breached the ministerial code following allegations of bullying in the three government departments in which she had served.
    
    > `My advice is that the Home Secretary has not consistently met the high standards required by the Ministerial Code of treating her civil servants with consideration and respect. Her approach on occasions has amounted to behaviour that can be described as bullying in terms of the impact felt by individuals. To that extent her behaviour has been in breach of the Ministerial Code, even if unintentionally. This conclusion needs to be seen in context. There is no evidence that she was aware of the impact of her behaviour, and no feedback was given to her at the time. The high pressure and demands of the role, in the Home Office, coupled with the need for more supportive leadership from top of the department has clearly been a contributory factor. In particular, I note the finding of different and more positive behaviour since these issues were raised with her.` [link](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/937010/Findings_of_the_Independent_Adviser.pdf)
    
- On 20 November 2020, Johnson expressed after the report was released that he had full confidence in Patel’s work.
    
    > `Boris Johnson told reporters during a visit to Public Health England in North London: "I absolutely do have confidence in Priti Patel. "I think she is a fantastic Home Secretary.` [link](https://www.lbc.co.uk/news/boris-johnson-absolutely-has-full-confidence-in-pr/)
    
- On 20 November 2020, Sir Alex Allan then announced that he had resigned as the Prime Minister's chief advisor on the ministerial code after Johnson rejected the findings of the inquiry and stated that he had "full confidence" in Patel.
    
    > `I recognise that it is for the Prime Minister to make a judgement on whether actions by a Minister amount to a breach of the Ministerial Code. But I feel that it is right that I should now resign from my position as the Prime Minister’s independent adviser on the Code.` [link](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/statement-from-sir-alex-allan)
    
- On 20 November 2020, Patel said that she had never set out to upset anyone and that she was absolutely sorry for anyone that I have upset.
    
    > `I work with thousands of brilliant civil servants every single day and we work together day in day out to deliver on the agenda of this Government and I'm absolutely sorry for anyone that I have upset` [link](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/11/20/boris-johnson-news-priti-patel-defence-lockdown-brexit-election/)
    
- In March 2021, the British Government and Rutnam reached a settlement. Rutnam received payment of £340,000 with a further £30,000 in costs. This arrangement meant that Patel would no longer be called to give evidence before a public tribunal which was due to be held in September 2021.
    
    > `Priti Patel has reached a six-figure settlement with a senior civil servant after claims that he was forced out of his job for intervening in her alleged bullying of fellow staff, it has emerged. Whitehall sources said Sir Philip Rutnam, a former permanent secretary in the Home Office, received a £340,000 settlement with a further £30,000 in costs. He had threatened to take the home secretary to an employment tribunal hearing in September.` [link](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/mar/04/priti-patel-reaches-six-figure-settlement-with-ex-home-office-chief-philip-rutnam)
    
### 2020 Dominic Cummings, Traveling with COVID Scandal
- On 27 March 2020, Boris Johnson announced he had tested positive with COVID-19 on his Twitter account.
    
    > `Over the last 24 hours I have developed mild symptoms and tested positive for coronavirus. I am now self-isolating, but I will continue to lead the government’s response via video-conference as we fight this virus. Together we will beat this. \#StayHomeSaveLives` [link](https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1243496858095411200?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1243496858095411200%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.itv.com%2Fnews%2F2020-05-26%2Fdominic-cummings-durham-trip-timeline)
    
- Just after Johnson’s announcement of his positive test, Cummings was seen rushing home from 10 Downing Street. The video showed the chief advisor running, with a backpack, toward a Downing Street exit out of the camera's sight.

    > `I suddenly got a call from my wife who was looking after our four-year-old child. She told me she suddenly felt badly ill.`[link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-52784290)
    
- According to Cummings, his wife's condition improved and he returned to work but that night they discussed her situation. Although she did not have a cough or fever he believed that she had caught the virus and that he was likely to catch it too. At that time he was well. They were both worried that they would become too weak to look after their four-year-old son.
    
    > `Evening: Mr Cummings went on to explain - "That evening I returned home and discussed the situation with my wife. She was ill. She might have Covid although she did not have a cough or a fever." Mr Cummings said many people he worked closely with, including the PM, had had symptoms or were absent with symptoms. He said: "I thought there was a distinct probability that I had already caught the disease."  
    >   
    > Later: Mr Cummings drove up to Durham with his family, arriving "at roughly midnight". "I was worried that if my wife and I were both seriously ill, possibly hospitalised, there was nobody in London we could reasonably ask to look after our child and expose themselves to Covid.  
    >   
    > "My wife had felt on the edge of being able to look after him safely a few hours earlier." Mr Cummings did not say that at the point the family drove north his wife was unable to look after their child.`  
    > [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-52784290)
    
- On 28 March 2020, According to Cummings, he woke up with COVID-19-like symptoms, which got worse in that he barely left his bed over the following days.
    
    > `Mr Cummings says he woke up "in pain and clearly had Covid symptoms, including a bad headache and a serious fever".` [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-52784290)
    
- On 30 March 2020, the government confirmed that Cummings had displayed symptoms of COVID-19 and was self-isolating at home but did not test.
    
    > `Following reports, Number 10 confirmed Mr Cummings and his wife Mary Wakefield had started showing symptoms of coronavirus “over the weekend”. The spokesman said Mr Cummings was self-isolating and staying in contact with Downing Street. He was not tested for coronavirus. Reports say around this time Mr Cummings made his trip to Durham.` [link](https://www.itv.com/news/2020-05-26/dominic-cummings-durham-trip-timeline/)
    
- On 2 April 2020, according to Cummings, his son became ill and was taken to hospital by ambulance following medical advice. He was tested for COVID-19 and the result given later was that he was not suffering from the virus. Cummings said he was too ill to go to the hospital, but his wife went.
    
    > `During the night, Mr Cummings' four-year-old son "threw up and had a bad fever". Following medical advice, an ambulance took the child to hospital. He was accompanied by Mr Cummings' wife. Mr Cummings "could barely stand up".` [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-52784290)
    
- On 3 April 2020, Cummings later said, he went to fetch his wife and son by car, but did not get out of the car as his son had recovered.
    
    > `After being taken to hospital, Mr Cummings' son woke up the next day having recovered. He was tested for coronavirus and his mother, who was with him at the hospital, was told "they should return home" (the test result arrived days later and was negative). According to Mr Cummings, there were no taxis so he "drove to the hospital, picked him up and returned home". He said he "did not leave the car or have any contact with anybody on this short trip". But according to his wife's later article in the Spectator Mr Cummings had a high fever and muscle spasms in his legs throughout this period.` [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-52784290)
    
- By 12 April 2020, Cummings was well enough, he said, to return to London. That day the family drove to Barnard Castle (30 miles or 50 kilometres away). Cummings stated this was to test whether he was well enough to drive, having some problems with his eyesight. He left the car at Barnard Castle after feeling sick.
    
    > `Mr Cummings and his wife were spotted 30 miles away from Durham in Barnard Castle by a member of the public, who passed the information to the Daily Mirror and Guardian. In his press conference, Mr Cummings confirmed he made the trip, but defended himself, saying the trip was only made as a test run, so he could test his **[eye sight](https://www.itv.com/news/2020-05-25/pm-and-top-aide-say-coronavirus-affected-their-eyesight)** before making the return journey to London. "My wife was very worried, particularly as my eyesight seemed to have been affected by the disease," he said. “We agreed that we should go for a short drive to see if I could drive safely, we drove for roughly half an hour and ended up on the outskirts of Barnard Castle town. “We did not visit the castle, we did not walk around the town.” The witness who saw him at Barnard Castle, Robin Lees, told ITV News there is "nothing wrong with my eyesight," adding, "not sure driving to test your eyesight is on". April 12 is also listed as Mary Wakefield's birthday. April 12 2020 would have been her 45th birthday.` [link](https://www.itv.com/news/2020-05-26/dominic-cummings-durham-trip-timeline)
    
- On 28 May 2020, Durham Constabulary said that they did not consider an offence to have been committed by Cummings in travelling from London to Durham. They also said that a minor breach relating to lockdown rules might have occurred at Barnard Castle, but because there was no apparent breach of the social distancing rules, no action would be taken at that point.
    
    > "Had a Durham Constabulary police officer stopped Mr Cummings driving to or from Barnard Castle, the officer would have spoken to him, and, having established the facts, likely advised Mr Cummings to return to the address in Durham, providing advice on the dangers of travelling during the pandemic crisis. Had this advice been accepted by Mr Cummings, no enforcement action would have been taken". [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-52835982)
    
### 2020-22 11 Downing Street Refurbishment
- On April 2020, Refurbishment on 11 Downing Street began whilst Johnson was being hospitalised with COVID-19.
- On 23 April 2021, the Prime Minister Boris Johnson's former aide, Dominic Cummings, made allegations on his personal blog that the prime minister had arranged for donors to secretly pay for renovations on the private residence at 11 Downing Street.
    
    > `Re the flat. The Prime Minister’s DOC has also made accusations regarding me and leaks concerning the PM’s renovation of his flat. The PM stopped speaking to me about this matter in 2020 as I told him I thought his plans to have donors secretly pay for the renovation were unethical, foolish, possibly illegal and almost certainly broke the rules on proper disclosure of political donations if conducted in the way he intended. I refused to help him organise these payments. My knowledge about them is therefore limited. I would be happy to tell the Cabinet Secretary or Electoral Commission what I know concerning this matter.` [link](https://dominiccummings.com/2021/04/23/statement-regarding-no10-claims-today/)
    
- On 28 May 2021, Lord Geidt released a report of `Annual Report by the Independent Adviser on Ministers’ Interests` which found that:
    
    > `It is clear from the record that while a serious and genuine endeavour, the Trust was not subjected to a scheme of rigorous project management by officials. Given the level of the Prime Minister’s expectations for the Trust to deliver on the objects he had set, this was a significant failing. Instead, the Prime Minister – unwisely, in my view – allowed the refurbishment of the apartment at No 11 Downing Street to proceed without more rigorous regard for how this would be funded.` [link](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/990394/Report_by_the_Independent_Adviser_May_2021__1_.pdf)
    
- On 9 December 2021, a Report of investigation released by the Electoral Commission found that:
    
    > `Our investigation looked at whether any transactions relating to works at 11 Downing Street fell within the party finance regime regulated by the Commission and whether any such transactions were recorded and reported as required.  
    >   
    > The evidence showed that the Conservative Party received a donation of £67,801.72 from Huntswood Associates Limited in October 2020 – £52,801.72 of which was to cover the cost of three invoices relating to the refurbishment of Downing Street. £15,000 was reported as a donation in the party’s Q4 2020 donation report; the remaining £52,801.72 was not.  
    >   
    > Our investigation concluded that the full amount of the £67,801.72 was a donation and should have been reported to the Commission. We also concluded that the reference to the payment made by the party for the refurbishment in the party’s financial records was not accurately recorded.  
    >   
    > The investigation found that decisions relating to the handling and recording of these transactions reflected serious failings in the party’s compliance systems. The registered treasurer had a responsibility to put in place systems appropriate to a party with a complex internal infrastructure and substantial sums of money coming into its accounts. However, in this instance, the payment was incorrectly described in internal records and the full value of the donation was not correctly identified and reported. Consequently, it was not included in our donation publication.  
    >   
    > The Commission considered other payments relating to the refurbishment works; they were not judged to be reportable donations, and so we found no offences in relation to those payments.  
    >   
    > For the offence of failing to accurately report the full value of the donation from Huntswood Associates, the Commission has imposed a penalty of £16,250. For contravening the requirement to keep proper accounting records, a penalty of £1,550 has been imposed.`

- After the Electoral Commission report released, it was accused that Johnson was misleading his ethics adviser Lord Geidt.
    
    > `Boris Johnson has been accused of misleading his own ethics adviser, exposing the prime minister to a potential suspension from the House of Commons, as MPs demanded a fresh investigation into his personal donors. With pressure mounting after a disastrous series of mistakes and scandals, Johnson’s integrity was once again under the spotlight after an official report suggested he gave differing accounts to investigators looking into the redecoration of his Downing Street flat.` [link](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/09/boris-johnson-accused-of-misleading-ethics-adviser-over-no-10-refurb)
    
- On 15 June 2022, Lord Geidt Resigned his position of Independent Adviser on Ministers' Interests. In his resignation letter, Geidt states:
    
    > `I was asked at length about my recent Annual Report. I alluded to my frustration, as made clear in my Preface, that you had not made any public reference to your own conduct under the Ministerial Code in the period since inquiries were underway. This would be especially important in the event that the Metropolitan Police found against you, which they did, and/or that Sue Gray’s report included criticism of behaviour within the scope of the Ministerial Code, which it did.  
    >   
    > Your letter in response to my Annual Report was welcome. It addressed the absence of comment by you about your obligations under that Ministerial Code up until that point. You explained that, by paying a Fixed Term Penalty, you had not breached the Ministerial Code. The letter did not, however, address specifically the criticism in Sue Gray’s report about your adherence to the Nolan Principles (on leadership, in particular). Neither did the letter make mention that, despite being repeatedly questioned in the House of Commons about your obligations under the Ministerial Code (after paying a Fixed Penalty Notice), your responses again made no reference to it.  
    >   
    > I reported to the Select Committee yesterday that I was satisfied that you had responded to my Annual Report to explain your position. I am disappointed, however, that the account you gave was not fuller, as noted above. Moreover, I regret the reference to ‘miscommunication’ between our offices, with the implication that I was somehow responsible for you not being fully aware of my concerns. These inconsistencies and deficiencies notwithstanding, I believed that it was possible to continue credibly as Independent Adviser, albeit by a very small margin.  
    >   
    > This week, however, I was tasked to offer a view about the Government’s intention to consider measures which risk a deliberate and purposeful breach of the Ministerial Code. This request has placed me in an impossible and odious position. My informal response on Monday was that you and any other Minister should justify openly your position vis-a-vis the Code in such circumstances. However, the idea that a Prime Minister might to any degree be in the business of deliberately breaching his own Code is an affront. A deliberate breach, or even an intention to do so, would be to suspend the provisions of the Code to suit a political end. This would make a mockery not only of respect for the Code but licence the suspension of its provisions in governing the conduct of Her Majesty’s Ministers. I can have no part in this.  
    >   
    > Because of my obligation as a witness in Parliament, this is the first opportunity I have had to act on the Government’s intentions. I therefore resign from this appointment with immediate effect.`  
    > [link](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/22061443/lord-geidt-to-pm.pdf)
    
- On 8 July 2022, an invoice was leaked including a list of items for the refurbishment totalling to over £200,000.
    
    > `The Independent has obtained a leaked copy of the invoice for the renovation of the prime minister’s Downing Street flat which shows it cost more than £200,000. Items ordered by Mr Johnson and wife Carrie from upmarket interior designer Lulu Lytle include a £3,675 drinks trolley said to be like the one owned in Paris by ballet dancer Rudolph Nureyev and £2,260 worth of the “gold” wallpaper that Mr Johnson privately complained his wife had purchased. Two sofas cost more than £15,000; £3,000 was spent on a “paint effect” for the flat hallway; and the cheapest item is a £500 kitchen table cloth. The estimate for building works, which involved sanding the floorboards, painting and decorating, and installing new furnishings and fittings came to £30,000.` [[borisjohnsonwallpa]]
    
### 2020-21 Johnson’s `Let the bodies pile high in their thousands` Comment
- On 26 April 2021, Johnson denied allegations made by the Daily Mail that he had said he would rather have seen bodies pile high in their thousands than approve a third lockdown.
    
    > `British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday denied a newspaper report that he had said he would rather bodies piled “high in their thousands” than order a third COVID-19 lockdown. Johnson is facing a stream of allegations in newspapers - all of them denied - about everything from his muddled initial handling of the COVID-19 crisis to questions over who financed the redecoration of his official apartment.` [link](https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-denies-report-that-pm-johnson-said-let-bodies-pile-high-2021-04-26/)
    
- The full remark was reported to have been "No more fucking lockdowns – let the bodies pile high in their thousands".
    
    > `Boris Johnson faced mounting pressure on Monday night as Conservative insiders added weight to claims that the prime minister said he would rather see bodies pile up than order another lockdown. Faced with fury from relatives of the bereaved, Johnson and senior ministers emphatically denied he said “no more fucking lockdowns – let the bodies pile high in their thousands” after reluctantly approving a second England-wide lockdown late last year.` [link](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/apr/26/pressure-mounts-on-boris-johnson-over-alleged-let-the-bodies-pile-high-remarks)
    
- Johnson is alleged to have said it on 30 October 2020, one day before the announcement of the second national lockdown.
    
    > `The accounts of what happened on the evening of October 30, 2020 could not be further apart – but on one matter there is unanimity. Boris Johnson was in a foul mood on a day he now wishes he could forget. Having publicly pledged to do everything he could to avoid the "disaster" of a second lockdown, the Prime Minister had been strong-armed by his most senior ministers and aides into agreeing to just that. Mr Johnson feared he would pay a heavy price politically for a decision that would hit the economy and rile Tory MPs and the public at large. He was wrong.` [link](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2021/04/26/let-bodies-pile-high-really-happened-night-boris-johnson-accused/)
    
- Sources told the BBC and Robert Peston of ITV News that the remark was made. According to Peston, the remarks were heard by a number of people. Johnson denied having made the remark, describing it as total rubbish.
    
    > `There is an incredible amount of hysteria and noise being generated by the conflict between Boris Johnson and his former chief aide, Dominic Cummings. So maybe it is useful for me to share what I know about three big claims:  
    >   
    > 1) The charge that Prime Minister did say he would rather see 'bodies pile high in their thousands' than order a third lockdown (as reported in the Daily Mail); 2) The cabinet secretary Simon Case still believes Cummings may be the 'Chatty Rat' who leaked details about November's lockdown; 3) the refurbishment of the Prime Minister's flat was originally to be funded by Tory party donors, even though on Friday the Prime Minister said he had been paying for it.`

The PM has strongly denied saying the phrase, describing the reports as "total rubbish".` [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-56890714)
    
- Former chief adviser Dominic Cummings said in a May select committee that he heard the remarks being made.

### 2020-22 Evgeny Lebedev, House of Lords Peerage
- Evgeny Alexandrovich Lebedev, born 8 May 1980, is a Russian-British businessman, who owns Lebedev Holdings Ltd, which in turn owns the Evening Standard, The Independent and the TV channel London Live. He derives his wealth from his father, Alexander Lebedev, a Russian oligarch and former KGB officer who was put on Canada's sanctions list following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.
- In 31 July 2020, Lebedev was nominated for a life peerage by Boris Johnson for philanthropy and services to the media, a move that drew criticism.
    
    > `Dear Mr Lebedev,  
    >   
    > Congratulations on your peerage! I am writing to set out the next steps in the process for you.  
    >   
    > Now that the announcement has been made you need to contact the Garter Principal King of Arms, Thomas Woodcock. He is aware that you will be getting in contact and will work with you to agree your title. You can contact Mr Woodcock at  
    >   
    > Once your title is agreed, Garter will arrange for your Letters Patent to be drawn up and from that date you will become a peer. On that day or any day thereafter you will be introduced to the House of Lords, at which point you will be able to participate in proceedings.  
    >   
    > Please do not hesitate to get in touch if you have any questions and congratulations once again on your elevation to the House of Lords.`

- On 5 March 2022, The Sunday Times released an article which alleged that British security services warned that granting Lebedev a peerage posed a national security risk, but Johnson went ahead with it despite the security service assessment. There were reports of trips and secret trips with Lebedev using a private jet without officials present.
    
    > `The security services withdrew an assessment that granting a peerage to a Russian businessman posed a national security risk after Boris Johnson intervened. The prime minister pushed ahead with the nomination of his friend Evgeny Lebedev, the Moscow-born son of an ex-KGB agent and media mogul, even after intelligence officials raised concerns. Johnson is said to have responded to advice to drop it by claiming: “This is anti-Russianism.” In March 2020, the House of Lords Appointments Commission (Holac), which vets peerages, wrote to the prime minister advising him against granting Lebedev, 41, a lifetime seat in the Lords.` [link](https://archive.ph/kQesM)
    
    > `The prime minister returned to Downing Street and took a personal interest in the case. A former adviser said he refused to accept the verdict of the security services and would not drop the issue. One source said Johnson’s political aides had helped to unblock sensitive peerages to which Holac had objected at around the same time — such as Lord Cruddas of Shoreditch, the former Conservative Party co-treasurer — as they were deemed to be of wider importance to the party. While they were “pretty disinterested” by Lebedev’s case, Johnson was insistent his peerage “go through”. By June, Holac received an update about Lebedev. Cabinet Office officials advised that the security services no longer deemed his peerage to be problematic. The source said: “The security services withdrew that particular quite damning bit of advice.”` [link](https://archive.ph/kQesM)
    
    > `A source said the strongly held suspicion was that Johnson had asked the security services whether “perhaps their advice could be watered down”. A second source, a former Downing Street aide, confirmed there had been a change in the security assessment, but they, like other senior officials at the time, did not know the exact circumstances leading up to it. A third source, who also worked in No 10, said they believed a “secret deal” had been done with security officials at the prime minister’s behest.` [link](https://archive.ph/kQesM)
    
    > `He is thought to have travelled to the castle at least six times, sometimes in Lebedev’s private jet. Even after being appointed foreign secretary in 2016, he continued to go, making at least one secret trip. He did so without his Metropolitan Police protection officers, tasked with giving him 24/7 protection. It means Johnson, as Britain’s top diplomat, spent time in the home of Russian oligarch without any security or officials present.` [link](https://archive.ph/kQesM)

    > `But I am not a security risk to this country, which I love. My father a long time ago was a foreign intelligence agent of the KGB, but I am not some agent of Russia. The editorial coverage in the Evening Standard and The Independent, of which I am also a shareholder, of Russia and its activities over the time of my involvement in those titles makes that clear. There can be no question of the editorial independence and excellence of both the titles in their coverage of this war.

I apologise unreservedly for the offence that it has caused up and down the country, and I apologise for the impression that it gives.

But I have asked the Cabinet Secretary to establish all the facts and to report back as soon as possible. It goes without saying that if those rules were broken, there will be disciplinary action for all those involved.`

    > `The UK's top civil servant has stepped aside from his role leading an inquiry into Downing Street lockdown parties, after it emerged an event was held in his own office. Simon Case had been due to report on claims Covid rules were broken at events for staff last year. But his role was put into doubt after reports a party was held in his office while London was under Covid rules. No 10 said the probe would be concluded by senior civil servant Sue Gray.` [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-59701369)
    
### 2022 Police Investigation
- On 24 January 2022, A police inquiry, called Operation Hillman, was started into 12 gatherings on 8 different days.
    
    > `The comments from Number 10 come after the Metropolitan Police announced it was launching an investigation into a "number of" gatherings during COVID-19 restrictions in 2020 and 2021, putting more pressure on the prime minister.  
    >   
    > Speaking in the Commons, Mr Johnson told MPs: "I welcome the Met's decision to conduct its own investigation because I believe this will help to give the public the clarity it needs and help to draw a line under matters."`

- On 19 May 2022, the Metropolitan Police said that they had completed their investigations, with the police concluding that offences were committed on 8 different dates.
    
    > `In total, detectives have made 126 referrals for fixed penalty notices (FPNs) to the ACRO Criminal Records Office for breaches of Covid-19 regulations.`  
    >   
    > ...  
    >   
    > `Of the referrals, all resulted or will do so in a FPN being issued. In total, this refers to 83 individuals. The breakdown of recipients is 53 FPNs were issued to 35 men and 73 FPNs to 48 women. A total of 28 people received between two and five referrals.`  
    >   
    > ...  
    >   
    > `Acting Deputy Commissioner Helen Ball, of the Met said: “There is no doubt that the pandemic impacted all of us in so many ways and strong feelings and opinions have been expressed on this particular issue. When Covid regulations were introduced, the Met was clear that whilst we would not routinely investigate breaches of regulations retrospectively, there may be occasions when it would be appropriate to do so. The information that we received with regard to the alleged breaches in Downing Street and Whitehall was sufficient to reach our criteria to begin such an investigation. Our investigation was thorough and impartial and was completed as quickly as we could, given the amount of information that needed to be reviewed and the importance of ensuring that we had strong evidence for each FPN referral. This investigation is now complete.”`

### 2022 Interim Sue Gray Report
- On 31 January 2022, Due to their being an ongoing Police Investigation, Sue Gray released an initial update report on `Investigation Into Alleged Gatherings on Government Premises During Covid Restrictions`. [link](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1051374/Investigation_into_alleged_gatherings_on_government_premises_during_Covid_restrictions_-_Update.pdf)
    
    > `Against the backdrop of the pandemic, when the Government was asking citizens to accept far-reaching restrictions on their lives, some of the behaviour surrounding these gatherings is difficult to justify.`
    
    > `At least some of the gatherings in question represent a serious failure to observe not just the high standards expected of those working at the heart of Government but also of the standards expected of the entire British population at the time.`
    
    > `At times it seems there was too little thought given to what was happening across the country in considering the appropriateness of some of these gatherings, the risks they presented to public health and how they might appear  
    > to the public. There were failures of leadership and judgment by different parts of No 10 and the Cabinet Office at different times. Some of the events should not have been allowed to take place. Other events should not have been  
    > allowed to develop as they did.`  
    
    > `The excessive consumption of alcohol is not appropriate in a professional workplace at any time. Steps must be taken to ensure that every Government Department has a clear and robust policy in place covering the consumption of alcohol in the workplace.`
    
    > `The use of the garden at No 10 Downing Street should be primarily for the Prime Minister and the private residents of No 10 and No 11 Downing Street. During the pandemic it was often used as an extension of the workplace as a  
    > more covid secure means of holding group meetings in a ventilated space. This was a sensible measure that staff appreciated, but the garden was also used for gatherings without clear authorisation or oversight. This was not  
    > appropriate. Any official access to the space, including for meetings, should be by invitation only and in a controlled environment.`  
    
    > `Some staff wanted to raise concerns about behaviours they witnessed at work but at times felt unable to do so. No member of staff should feel unable to report or challenge poor conduct where they witness it. There should be easier ways for staff to raise such concerns informally, outside of the line management chain.`
    
    > `The gatherings within the scope of this investigation are spread over a 20-month period – a period that has been unique in recent times in terms of the complexity and breadth of the demands on public servants and indeed the general public. The whole of the country rose to the challenge. Ministers, special advisers and the Civil Service, of which I am proud to be a part, were a key and dedicated part of that national effort. However, as I have noted, a number of these gatherings should not have been allowed to take place or to develop in the way that they did. There is significant learning to be drawn from these events which must be addressed immediately across Government. This does not need to wait for the police investigations to be concluded.`

Lee Cain, the then No 10 Director of Communications (a special adviser), also received the invitation. In response, he emailed Martin Reynolds, No 10 official (1), and Dominic Cummings at 14.35 on 20 May 2020 stating: ‘I’m sure it will be fine - and I applaud the gesture - but a 200 odd person invitation for drinks in the garden of no 10 is somewhat of a comms risk in the current environment.’ Lee Cain says he subsequently spoke to Martin Reynolds and advised him that the event should be cancelled. Martin Reynolds does not recall any such conversation. In addition, Dominic Cummings has also said that he too raised concerns, in writing.

Five special advisers attended. The Prime Minister joined them at about 20.00. Food and alcohol were available. The discussion carried on later into the evening with attendees leaving at various points. The information collected on this gathering is limited as the process of obtaining evidence had only just been commenced when the Metropolitan Police announced their own investigations, which included events on the 13 November 2020.

Inside the Press Office a further 15-20 people were present.` [[p31]](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1078404/2022-05-25_FINAL_FINDINGS_OF_SECOND_PERMANENT_SECRETARY_INTO_ALLEGED_GATHERINGS.pdf)
        
        > `There was food and alcohol available which had been bought and brought in by staff. Some members of staff drank excessively. The event was crowded and noisy such that some people working elsewhere in the No 10 building that evening heard significant levels of noise coming from what they characterised as a ‘party’ in the Press Office. A cleaner who attended the room the next morning noted that there had been red wine spilled on one wall and on a number of boxes of photocopier paper.` [[p31/32]](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1078404/2022-05-25_FINAL_FINDINGS_OF_SECOND_PERMANENT_SECRETARY_INTO_ALLEGED_GATHERINGS.pdf)

        > `On 7 January 2021 Stuart Glassborow, the Prime Minister's Deputy Principal Private Secretary and line manager of the departing individuals, sent an email inviting staff to a ‘Virtual Leaving Presentation’, to be held on 14 January 2021 between 17.30-18.30 to mark the leaving of two No 10 officials. The email contained only a Microsoft Teams online link; no information was initially given to suggest an in-person event. This email was subsequently forwarded to approximately 40 people across No 10, the Cabinet Office and HM Treasury. There was a link provided in the invitation for those attending virtually.` [[p32/33]](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1078404/2022-05-25_FINAL_FINDINGS_OF_SECOND_PERMANENT_SECRETARY_INTO_ALLEGED_GATHERINGS.pdf)

Approximately 15 members of staff from the No 10 Private Office and No 10 Policy Unit attended in person, with up to 30 people joining virtually. The Prime Minister attended at approximately 18.00 for around ten minutes in between meetings. He gave a short speech thanking those leaving before retuming to his office. There were further speeches by other members of No 10 staff. There are photographs of the event. Following the speeches while some people left, others remained in the Pillared Room and continued to chat and drink. It is unclear what time the event finished. We were informed at least some of those present were there beyond 23.00.` [[p33]](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1078404/2022-05-25_FINAL_FINDINGS_OF_SECOND_PERMANENT_SECRETARY_INTO_ALLEGED_GATHERINGS.pdf)

        > `The Digital team is part of the No 10 Press Office team and there was considerable overlap in attendance at the two events. The first, for James Slack, began at approximately 18.30, with speeches in the Press Office. He wished to thank his team members individually and to set out future direction for the team. It lasted for around an hour and there were approximately 45 people in total in attendance both in the office and with a small number online. Those present in person came from across No 10, including senior officials. Some joined the event virtually. Wine and beer had been bought by staff and was consumed by some during the speeches.` [[p34]](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1078404/2022-05-25_FINAL_FINDINGS_OF_SECOND_PERMANENT_SECRETARY_INTO_ALLEGED_GATHERINGS.pdf)
        
        > `Following the speeches, some staff returned to work but others continued chatting and drinking.

        > `The second event, for the other No 10 official, was held in the offices of the Digital Team in the basement of No 10. It began at approximately the same time as the event for the Director of Communications, at around 18.00, but was smaller in scale, with 15-20 people present, including a special adviser and more junior officials. There were leaving speeches and a presentation. Wine was available and music was played from a laptop on top of a printer.

        > `There was mingling between the two events, with some staff moving up and down the stairs in between the basement and the Press Office. The two groups eventually joined together in the Downing Street garden. Shortly before 21.30, there were over 20 people present in the garden, with a number of bottles of alcohol. A number of individuals gathered near a child’s swing/slide in the garden, damaging it by leaning on and playing with it. This was noticed the next morning and reported to No 10 staff.

    - Conclusions of the Report
        
        > `Whatever the initial intent, what took place at many of these gatherings and the way in which they developed was not in line with Covid guidance at the time. Even allowing for the extraordinary pressures officials and advisers were under, the factual findings of this report illustrate some attitudes and behaviours inconsistent with that guidance. It is also clear, from the outcome of the police investigation, that a large number of individuals (83) who attended these events breached Covid regulations and therefore Covid guidance.` [[p36]](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1078404/2022-05-25_FINAL_FINDINGS_OF_SECOND_PERMANENT_SECRETARY_INTO_ALLEGED_GATHERINGS.pdf)
        
        > `The events that I investigated were attended by leaders in government. Many of these events should not have been allowed to happen. It is also the case that some of the more junior civil servants believed that their involvement in some of these events was permitted given the attendance of senior leaders. The senior leadership at the centre, both political and official, must bear responsibility for this culture.` [[p36]](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1078404/2022-05-25_FINAL_FINDINGS_OF_SECOND_PERMANENT_SECRETARY_INTO_ALLEGED_GATHERINGS.pdf)
        
        > `I found that some staff had witnessed or been subjected to behaviours at work which they had felt concerned about but at times felt unable to raise properly. I was made aware of multiple examples of a lack of respect and poor treatment of security and cleaning staff. This was unacceptable.` [[p36]](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1078404/2022-05-25_FINAL_FINDINGS_OF_SECOND_PERMANENT_SECRETARY_INTO_ALLEGED_GATHERINGS.pdf)

### 2022 Lord Geidt’s Reaction
- On 31 May 2022, Lord Geidt, the Government's independent adviser on ministers' interests, published his annual report.
    
    > `In the case of the Fixed Penalty Notice recently issued to and paid by the Prime Minister, a legitimate question has arisen as to whether those facts alone might have constituted a breach of the overarching duty within the Ministerial Code of complying with the law. It may be that the Prime Minister considers that no such breach of his Ministerial Code has occurred. In that case, I believe a Prime Minister should respond accordingly, setting out his case in public.  
    >   
    > Such a circular process could only risk placing the Ministerial Code in a place of ridicule. Instead, and since the point when the inquiries by the Cabinet Secretary (later conducted by the Second Permanent Secretary) and the Metropolitan Police were embarked upon, I have repeatedly counselled the Prime Minister’s official and political advisers that the Prime Minister should be ready to offer public comment on his obligations under the Ministerial Code, even if he has judged himself not to be in breach. This has been my standing advice, which I was assured had been conveyed to the Prime Minister. Its purpose has simply been to ensure that the Prime Minister should publicly be seen to take responsibility for his own conduct under his own Ministerial Code. That advice has not been heeded and, in relation to the allegations about unlawful gatherings in Downing Street, the Prime Minister has made not a single public reference to the Ministerial Code.`  
    > [link](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1080213/independent-adviser-annual-report.pdf)
    
- On 31 May 2022, As requested by Lord Geidt, Johnson then made his case to Lord Geidt public in which he blamed a possible failure of communication between Johnson and Lord Geidt, that Johnson had taken full responsibility and stated that the fixed penalty notice was not a criminal conviction.
    
    > `When we spoke earlier today, you confirmed that you had not raised with me directly your advice to make a public comment, nor were you asking me to adjudicate on the Ministerial Code. Notwithstanding, I understand your frustration that there may have been a failure of communication between our offices, such that I was not aware of the weight you put on the absence of an explicit reference to the Ministerial Code.  
    >   
    > ...  
    >   
    > As you know, I have previously sought your independent advice, and acted upon it, in order to ensure that my responsibilities under the Code were properly discharged. Turning to recent events, I have taken full responsibility for everything that took place on my watch, and reiterate my apology to the House and to the whole country in respect of the gathering on 19 June in the Cabinet Room for which I received a fixed penalty notice.  
    >   
    > I have also been clear that there was no intent to break the regulations; at the time I did not consider that the circumstances in which I received a fixed penalty notice were contrary to the regulations. I have accepted the outcome and paid it in compliance with legal requirements. Paying a fixed penalty notice is not a criminal conviction. I have corrected the record in Parliament, where it transpired that the information I previously conveyed in good faith was not ultimately correct: this correction to Parliament is in line with the Ministerial Code.`

### 2023 Johnson Resigns as Member of Parliament
- On 9 June 2023, after receiving a confidential report from the Privileges Committee of the House of Commons that was looking into whether he had intentionally misled Parliament over lockdown-breaking parties in Downing Street during the COVID-19 pandemic, Johnson announced his resignation as MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip, triggering a by-election.
    
    > `Boris Johnson has announced he is standing down as an MP with immediate effect after receiving the report into whether he lied to MPs over partygate.  
    >   
    > In an excoriating statement, the former prime minister said a letter from the privileges committee made clear "that they are determined to use the proceedings against me to drive me out of parliament".  
    >   
    > As a result, Mr Johnson said: "I have written to my association in Uxbridge and South Ruislip to say that I am stepping down forthwith and triggering an immediate by-election.  
    >   
    > "I am very sorry to leave my wonderful constituency. It has been a huge honour to serve them, both as Mayor and MP."`

### 2023 Privileges Committee Report on Johnson
- On 15 June 2023, The House of Commons Committee of Privileges released a report on `Matter referred on 21 April 2022 (conduct of Rt Hon Boris Johnson): Final Report`.
    
    > `Using the categories of misleading set out in paragraph 32 of the Fourth Report, we conclude that:  
    >   
    > a) Mr Johnson misled the House when he said on 1 December 2021 that all Guidance was followed completely in No. 10, when he said on 8 December 2021 that the Rules and Guidance were followed at all times, on 12 January 2022 when he said that events at No. 10 were within the Rules and Guidance, and on 25 May 2022 when he said that the Rules and Guidance had been followed at all times when he was present at gatherings to wish staff farewell. See paragraph 117.  
    >   
    > b) Mr Johnson misled the House when he failed to tell the House about his own knowledge of the gatherings where the Rules or Guidance had been broken. See paragraphs 23 to 94.  
    >   
    > c) Mr Johnson misled the House when he said on 8 December 2021 that he relied upon repeated assurances that the rules had not been broken. There is evidence that Mr Johnson was assured by two individuals who had worked at No. 10 at the time that they did not think the gathering of 18 December 2020 had broken Covid rules–see paragraphs 136 to 144, and 176. However, we conclude that:  
    >   
    > i) Mr Johnson had personal knowledge about gatherings which he should have disclosed. See paragraphs 23 to 94.  
    >   
    > ii) Mr Johnson concedes that there was no assurance about any gathering’s compliance with the guidance that was in place at the time (as opposed to compliance with the Covid rules), yet Mr Johnson gave the House the impression that those assurances had been overarching and comprehensive in respect of No. 10’s compliance with all Covid measures. See paragraphs 144, 146, 161, and 180 to 183.  
    >   
    > iii) The purported assurances were only about the gathering of 18 December 2020, not more generally about No. 10’s compliance with the Rules and Guidance, yet Mr Johnson gave the House the impression that those assurances had been overarching and comprehensive in respect of No. 10’s compliance with Covid measures across the whole period of restrictions. In particular, we have received no evidence that any specific assurance was provided in relation to the gatherings of 20 May 2020, 19 June 2020, 13 November 2020, 27 November 2020 and 14 January 2021 which we have examined in detail. See paragraphs 145, and 180 to 183.  
    >   
    > iv) The context for the initial purported assurance was in response to a media inquiry and the assertion that Covid rules were followed was initially developed in haste, and without further investigation, as a media line to take. They were therefore not appropriate for Mr Johnson to cite as an authoritative indication of No. 10’s compliance with Covid measures. See paragraphs 137 to 141.  
    >   
    > The only two purported assurances for which there is firm evidence did not emanate from senior permanent civil servants or government lawyers but from two media advisers, one of whom was a personal political appointment by Mr Johnson. The purported assurances consisted only of what those individuals themselves believed about the compliance of the gathering of 18 December 2020 with the Rules. They were therefore not appropriate to be cited as an authoritative indication of No. 10’s compliance with Covid measures. See paragraphs 139 to 144, 163 to 165, and 176 to 178.  
    >   
    > d) Mr Johnson misled the House when he gave the impression that there needed to be an investigation by the Second Permanent Secretary to establish whether the rules and guidance had been broken before he could answer questions to the House. While repeatedly making that statement to the House, he had personal knowledge that he did not reveal. See paragraphs 23 to 94, and 127.  
    >   
    > e) We additionally find that Mr Johnson misled the House when he purported to correct the record on 25 May 2022. We have concluded above that his statement on that date that the Covid Rules and Guidance were followed while he was in attendance at farewell gatherings at No. 10 was misleading. As such, it represented a continuation of his previous misleading of the House, and seeking to present it as a correction was itself misleading. His insistence on the truthfulness of this statement in his written evidence, and his refusal to correct the record when invited to do so during his oral evidence on 22 March 2023, is a further misleading. See paragraphs 131 and 187.  
    >   
    > 189. We further conclude that Mr Johnson has been disingenuous with the Committee in ways which amount to misleading, as follows:  
    >   
    > a) By adopting a narrow and restricted interpretation of the assertions he gave to the House in PMQs on 1 and 8 December 2021 which is at odds with the general impression he clearly wished to give in the House that all Rules and Guidance at No. 10 had been followed at all times. See paragraphs 180 to 183.  
    >   
    > b) By claiming that when he referred to having been repeatedly assured, by “repeatedly” he had meant merely “on more than one occasion”. We note that this is contrary to common English usage. It is clear that when Mr Johnson used the term “repeatedly” at PMQs, he wished his audience to suppose that there had been multiple occasions at which assurances had been given, rather than merely more than one, and, as suggested by our evidence, possibly as few as two. See paragraph 134.  
    >   
    > c) By undertaking to provide the Committee with the name of another person who had provided assurances, and then failing to do so. See paragraphs 167 to 169.  
    >   
    > d) By stating at the oral evidence session that the Committee had withheld from publication “the evidence that I rely on, which answers the charges” and “a large number of extracts which I rely upon in my defence”, but then, when the Committee had facilitated the production of that evidence accompanied by statements of truth, failing to make any use of it in his subsequent final submission. This strongly suggests that Mr Johnson did not “rely on” the evidence at all but was simply using it as a gambit to criticise the Committee in the public hearing. See paragraph 220.  
    >   
    > e) By advancing an unsustainable interpretation of Guidance in order that he can deny the implications of the evidence showing a lack of social distancing. See paragraphs 99 to 102, and 115 to 116.  
    >   
    > f) By being unable to deny that he said the words “probably the most unsocially distanced gathering in the UK right now” while not admitting that he said them, which has the ring of avoidance about it. See paragraphs 68 to 69.`

### 2022 Johnson’s Comments On Starmer & Saville
- On 31 January 2022, In the House of Commons, Johnson falsely blamed Starmer for the non-prosecution of serial sex offender Jimmy Savile when Starmer was Director of Public Prosecutions in the Crown Prosecution Service.
- On 3 February 2022, A Downing Street source said that Johnson still would not apologise for the slur against Starmer.
    
    > `No 10 has no intention of apologising for the PM's false claim that Sir Keir Starmer failed to prosecute Jimmy Savile, after the Labour leader was targeted by protesters near Parliament. Boris Johnson is facing fresh calls from Tory MPs to say sorry, after protesters were heard shouting about the sex offender, as well as protesting about Covid measures. But a senior source told the BBC: "He's got other stuff to get on with today." Mr Johnson did condemn the harassment.` [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-60297998)
    
- On 3 February 2022, Johnson policy adviser Munira Mirza resigned saying in her resignation letter that Johnson had made a scurrilous and inappropriate accusation against Starmer.
    
    > `It is with great regret that I am writing to resign as your Head of Policy.  
    >   
    > You are aware of the reason for my decision: I believe it was wrong for you to imply this week that Keir Starmer was personally responsible for allowing Jimmy Savile to escape justice. There was no fair or reasonable basis for that assertion. This was not the usual cut and thrust of politics; it was an inappropriate and partisan reference to a horrendous case of child sex abuse. You tried to clarify your position today but, despite my urging, you did not apologise for the misleading impression you gave.`  
    > [link](https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/exclusive-boris-s-policy-chief-quits-over-jimmy-savile-slur)
    
- In 2012, when he was Director of Public Prosecutions, Starmer commissioned a report from Alison Levitt QC called `In The Matter Of The Late Jimmy Saville` into why Savile was not prosecuted.
    
    > `One of the decisions not to prosecute was correct, but not for the reason given. No prosecution could have taken place on the evidence of Ms G because the behaviour complained of did not amount to a criminal offence. Ms G’s alleged unwillingness to give evidence was therefore immaterial.`
    
    > `In relation to the three other allegations, on the information available these were credible complaints of criminal offences based on reliable evidence. However, all three alleged victims had expressed unwillingness to attend court.`
    
    > `Taken at face value, the decisions not to prosecute in the cases of Ms E and Ms A were not unreasonable, for these reasons: there was insufficient other evidence to prosecute in the absence of the complainants’ accounts; an application to adduce their evidence under the hearsay provisions of Part 11 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 would, in my view, have failed, and issuing a witness summons against a reluctant witness in these sensitive cases must always be a matter of last resort.` [link](https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukgwa/20130703165341/http:/www.cps.gov.uk/news/assets/uploads/files/savile_report.pdf)
    
### 2022-23 David Warburton, Whip Suspended for Multiple Misconduct Allegations
- On 2 April 2022, Conservative MP David Warburton had been suspended from the parliamentary party pending an investigation into allegations about sexual and other misconduct. Warburton was admitted to a psychiatric hospital. His wife said he was suffering from severe shock and stress following the allegations.
    
    > `MP David Warburton has been admitted to a psychiatric hospital after a parliamentary investigation was launched into his conduct, his wife has told the BBC.  
    >   
    > His wife, Harriet, said he had severe shock and stress.  
    >   
    > The Conservative whips office said he had been suspended from the parliamentary party while the investigation was ongoing.  
    >   
    > Conservative sources said there were three allegations of sexual harassment. The investigation was launched by the Parliament's Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS) following allegations about Mr Warburton's conduct in the Sunday Times newspaper.  
    >   
    > The newspaper said three women have complained about Mr Warburton's conduct.`  
    > [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-60975624)
    
- On 2 April 2022, The Sunday Times released an article about the sex and drugs allegations. [link](https://archive.ph/gu3gw)
    - Warburton allegedly asked Woman 1 for cocaine to be bought on his behalf.
        
        > `He is said to have snorted “line after line after line” of the drug at the London home of a younger woman in the early hours of February 1. He had met her through politics and allegedly insisted on coming over, despite evidence that she was drunk.  
        >   
        > Hours earlier Warburton, a 56-year-old married father of two and former businessman, had asked the woman to order the class A drugs on his behalf, telling her he would pay for them. According to an audio recording, he dismissed the suggestion that paying £160 for two grams was “spenny” — expensive — and said it was “quite good actually”.`  
        
    - Warburton allegedly, also made unwanted sexual advancements towards Woman 1.
        
        > `She recounts that as she became less drunk she grew uncomfortable that the pair were alone together and retreated to her bedroom to put on her pyjamas in an attempt to encourage his departure. When she emerged, she says, Warburton was naked. He allegedly explained that he always slept nude and climbed into her bed. Fearful of how he might react, she did not push him away, she says, or demand that he leave.  
        >   
        > Despite her repeated and explicit warnings, before and during his visit, that she did not want to have sex with him or do anything sexual, Warburton allegedly ground his body against hers and groped her breasts. The woman says she lay frozen until the MP fell asleep, snoring loudly.  
        >   
        > The following morning Warburton is said to have woken up and asked her if she was “proud” that an MP had slept at her home. She says she showed him the door, then had a long shower. She felt ashamed and violated. At 1.50pm he sent her a WhatsApp message asking if she was available and stating: “Promise I won’t remove all my clothes again.” The pair have not met since.  
        >   
        > The woman did not make a complaint to the police or any other authority. She says Warburton was a powerful man and she would not have known which course of action to take. She also says she wanted to forget about the incident.`  
        
    - Warburton allegedly had received a large donation that wasn't declared from a FCA limited Russian Financial Adviser.
        
        > `He borrowed £100,000 from a Russian businessman without declaring it, a decision that could lead to an investigation by the parliamentary commissioner for standards.  
        >   
        > The man who lent him the money is Roman Joukovski, a financial adviser who has specialised in offshore tax advice and providing tier-one “golden” investor visas to foreign citizens, including oligarchs and the family of Kazakhstan’s dictator Nursultan Nazarbayev. In 2014 the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) refused to certify him as a “fit and proper person”, limiting his ability to provide certain kinds of financial advice, and one of his businesses was recently forced into insolvency after a separate FCA ruling.  
        >   
        > Warburton knew about Joukovski’s past problems with the regulator, but took the loan via an offshore entity linked to the businessman’s family trust. He later brought the Russian-born British citizen into the Palace of Westminster and used his parliamentary email address to organise meetings for Joukovski, including one with Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Brexit opportunities secretary, who was a backbencher at the time in 2017. According to a source with direct knowledge of the transaction, Warburton has since repaid the money at high levels of interest.  
        >   
        > Parliamentary rules state that MPs must register an interest, in this case a loan, within 28 days if it has any bearing on their parliamentary activities. If an MP has any doubt about whether an interest should be declared, they are advised to do so. At no point has Warburton disclosed any details of his financial relationship with Joukovski.`  
        
    - During the pandemic, Warburton was using more cocaine and involved in more incidents of Warburton being sexually inappropriate to Woman 2 and Woman 3.
        
        > `During the pandemic, Warburton’s life changed. He increasingly spent time away from home, in his taxpayer-funded flat in County Hall, across the Thames from parliament. His wife remained in Somerset caring for their children. Then, in January last year, Warburton posted a photograph revealing he had lost eight stone by lifting weights and avoiding carbohydrates. His selfie prompted congratulations from the prime minister, the health secretary and others.  
        >   
        > Warburton was living increasingly recklessly. He started sending suggestive texts to at least one younger woman whom he had met through politics but did not work for him last year. It also appears that he took cocaine, writing to the woman in November to say: “Yep have some cheeky coke obvs.” Last month he texted her saying: “Does your dealer do Westminster Bridge area!?” He added: “Have just been put on a one line-whip” — meaning that he was not obliged to participate in votes in the Commons that day — “so your happy Monday has made me want to call my dealer ... but he takes aeons.”  
        >   
        > The two women who have reported him allege that Warburton started behaving inappropriately towards them too, both in parliament and at late-night events in and around Westminster. The conduct varied in its severity. He is said to have subjected one female aide to months of sexualised comments, telling her he would have slept with her had they been the same age and refusing to stop calling her “baby”. At the British Kebab awards, a boozy event in Westminster attended by MPs and young researchers, he allegedly groped her thigh in an incident witnessed by another person.  
        >   
        > The two women allege that Warburton pressured them into drinking more alcohol than they were comfortable with and that he coerced them into returning to his flat. In one incident alleged to have taken place this year, he told an aide to return with him to the property, where, against her will, he allegedly kissed her forehead, stroked her hair, placed his hand on her thigh and repeatedly rubbed it. The other female staff member recounted an incident in which he had caressed her and refused to let her leave his home, marshalling her back inside when she sought to leave.`  
        
- On 21 November 2022, Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, Kathryn Stone, found that there were two breaches of the code of conduct but the breaches had been rectified after Warburton wrote to Stone.
    
    > `During my inquiry, I established that the loan had been provided to Mr Warburton by Mr Roman Joukovski in August 2017 through an intermediary company, Castlebrook Associates Limited (Seychelles). I also established that the loan was for a personal matter and was not provided on a free or concessionary basis. My inquiry established that during the period that the loan was active (it was repaid in March 2022), Mr Warburton assisted Mr Joukovski in his dealings with the FCA. I determined that this assistance was provided in a personal capacity. I was also satisfied on the evidence that the loan had not influenced Mr Warburton's words or actions as a Member.  
    >   
    > Mr Warburton told me that he did not register the loan at the time because it was “…entirely unconnected with either my role as an MP or any parliamentary activities” and also told me "in no way did (the loan) ever influence my words or actions as a Member. Nor could it have done".  
    >   
    > After taking advice from the Registrar of Members' Financial Interests, I concluded that the loan should have been registered under Category 8 of the Register of Members' Financial Interests as a miscellaneous financial interest. I reached this conclusion because an onlooker might have reasonably thought that at the time the loan was provided it had the potential to influence Mr Warburton's words or actions as a Member. I decided that the failure to register the loan amounted to a breach of paragraph 14 of the Code.  
    >   
    > I also concluded that the loan should have been declared when Mr Warburton wrote to the FCA about Mr Joukovski on 12 March 2021. This is because an onlooker might reasonably have thought that the loan was either influencing the words in Mr Warburton's reference or had influenced Mr Warburton's decision to write a reference. I decided that the failure to declare the loan when writing to the FCA amounted to a further breach of paragraph 14 of the Code.  
    >   
    > However, I decided that the letter of reference submitted by Mr Warburton did not amount to paid advocacy and was not a breach of paragraph 12 of the Code. This is because the letter sent by Mr Warburton did not suggest that the FCA should take any positive action in respect of Mr Joukovski, nor did it make any representations on Mr Joukovski’s behalf. I was therefore satisfied that the letter was not seeking to confer "a financial or material benefit” on Mr Joukovski. I was also mindful that the letter was submitted substantially outside the six-month time limit set by the House's paid advocacy rules.`

- On 17 June 2023, Warburton announced his intention to resign from Parliament, citing his feeling that the parliamentary harassment watchdog denied him a fair hearing over claims he harassed two women. He admitted to taking cocaine after drinking whisky with a third woman.
    
    > `A Conservative MP accused of sexual harassment and drug abuse has resigned - triggering a by-election in his Somerton and Frome constituency.

    > David Warburton, 57, was suspended from the party in April 2022 pending the outcome of an Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS) investigation into the allegations.

    >   
    > ...  
    >   
    > In his resignation letter, Mr Warburton said the "malicious allegations" and "flawed" 14-month investigation had "inflicted unimaginable and intolerable destruction on my family and on me".  
    >   
    > He said had been left with "no choice" but to provoke "the upheaval of a by-election", adding: "It is my hope that, in so doing, I can freely illuminate the methods of an oversight system not fit for purpose, so that friends and colleagues in the House can see the perverted process by which their own judgement may at any time be freighted."  
    >   
    > He claimed the ICGS "prevented" him from speaking out and that it "moves at a cripplingly glacial pace towards a predetermined conclusion".`

### 2022 Lee Anderson Foodbanks Comments
- On 11 May 2022, Lee Anderson faced backlash after saying there's not this massive use for food banks in this country during a Commons debate and that people can make a meal for about 30p a day.
    
    > Lee Anderson: `the hon. Member for St Helens North made some great comments about food banks. My invitation is to every Opposition Member: come to Ashfield, work with me for a day in my local food bank and see the brilliant scheme we have in place. When people come for a food parcel now, they have to register for a budgeting course and a cooking course. We show them how to cook cheap and nutritious meals on a budget; we can make a meal for about 30p a day, and this is cooking from scratch.`  
    >   
    > Alex Cunningham: `Can the hon. Gentleman answer a simple question for me: should it be necessary to have food banks in 21st century Britain?`  
    >   
    > Lee Anderson: `I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention, as he makes a great point. Indeed, it is exactly my point, so I invite him personally to come to Ashfield to look at how our food bank works. He will see at first hand that there is not this massive use for food banks in this country. We have generation after generation who cannot cook properly—they cannot cook a meal from scratch—and they cannot budget. The challenge is there. I make that offer to anybody. Opposition Members are sitting there with glazed expressions on their faces, looking at me as though I have landed from a different planet. They should come to Ashfield, next week or the week after, and come to a real food bank that is making a real difference to people’s lives.`

- On 27 March 2022, The Trussell Trust charity said it had distributed over 2.1 million emergency food parcels to people in crisis in the past year, with growing numbers visiting food banks across the country as a result of the cost of living hikes.
    
    > `New figures released today reveal food banks in the Trussell Trust’s network provided more than 2.1 million parcels to people facing financial hardship across the country, from 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2022. This represents a 14% increase compared to the same period in 2019/20 – before the pandemic – as more and more people are unable to afford the absolute essentials that we all need to eat, stay warm, dry and clean. This is the first time food banks in the Trussell Trust’s network have provided more than 2 million parcels, outside of 2020/21, at the height of the pandemic. Alarmingly, more than 830,000 parcels were provided for children, representing a 15% increase from 2019/20 when 720,000 were provided. The Trussell Trust says food banks in its network experienced their busiest winter outside of 2020 at the height of the pandemic, providing 1.2 million parcels in the second half of the year alone (from October to the end of March).` [link](https://www.trusselltrust.org/2022/04/27/food-banks-provide-more-than-2-1-million-food-parcels-to-people-across-the-uk-in-past-year-according-to-new-figures-released-by-the-trussell-trust/)
    
### 2022 Nadine Dorries, Channel 4 Paid Actors Claim
- On 19 May 2022, Nadine Dorries, the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport appeared in front of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee in which she claimed that Channel 4 faked a reality TV show she appeared on in 2010 by hiring actors to play poverty-stricken people on a housing estate.
    
    > `Dr Huq: I might avail myself as well. I remember asking in the Chamber about the same issue and I do not think it is sorted. One of my favourite Channel 4 programmes was "Tower Block of Commons"; I think we have chatted about it before. You were on it as a young MP on the South Acton estate, being sent to see how the other half live.  
    >   
    > Ms Dorries: Then I later discovered that they were actually actors.  
    >   
    > Chair: What, the MPs or the—  
    >   
    > Ms Dorries: No, the people in the estate. It was a Channel 4 production. The parents of some of the boys in that programme contacted me and came here to have lunch to tell me that the boys were in acting school. They were not really living in a flat—they were not real. They were actually actors.  
    >   
    > Dr Huq: That will be a headline tomorrow.  
    >   
    > Ms Dorries: If you remember, there was a pharmacist I went to see who prepared food; she was also a paid actor as well.  
    >   
    > Dr Huq: It was jolly good viewing, and it was on the South Acton estate.`  
    > [link](https://committees.parliament.uk/oralevidence/10242/pdf/)
    
- On 15 July 2022, Channel 4 released a statement in response to the comments Dorries made.
    
    > `At the DCMS Committee meeting on 19 May 2022, Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, Nadine Dorries MP alleged that contributors to the 2010 Channel 4 series Tower Block of Commons, in which she appeared, were paid actors, in acting school and/or not living in the homes in which they were portrayed in the series as living.  
    >   
    > Channel 4 takes any allegations of misrepresentation extremely seriously and always rigorously investigates any such claims.  
    >   
    > In keeping with standard practice Channel 4 asked Love Productions, who produced the programme, to conduct a thorough investigation into the concerns raised. The investigation, overseen by their external lawyers, encompassed contributors who were ordinary members of the public and with whom The Secretary of State had significant interaction. It involved speaking with many of those involved in the making of the series, including contributors and crew, and retrieving and reviewing relevant documentation and footage, including 85 hours of raw footage filmed for the series.  
    >   
    > Channel 4 then reviewed Love Productions’ findings and undertook its own internal document searches and review.  
    >   
    > Neither Love Productions' investigation nor Channel 4’s internal inquiries revealed any evidence to support the allegations made about the programme.`  
    > [link](https://www.channel4.com/press/news/channel-4s-statement-tower-block-commons)
    
- On 20 October 2022, the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee released a report on the comments made by Dorries and found them to not be credible.
    
    > `We are disappointed with Ms Dorries reluctance to engage with the Committee on this matter. Ms Dorries at first refused to reconsider her claims and her subsequent clarifications introduce more confusion than they resolve.  
    >   
    > In the Committee she talks about meeting boys in a flat (which matches Channel 4's investigation) who later turned out to be actors. Her clarification talks about a homeless young men section.  
    >   
    > In the Committee she said that she saw a pharmacist who prepared food and who was also an actor. In her clarification, that pharmacist was the mother of one of the boys.  
    >   
    > In the Committee she said that the parents of one of the boys contacted her and came to have lunch to tell her the boys were in acting school. In her clarification, the mother, who was also the pharmacist, arranged for her son to come to the House for a tour and lunch and it was he who told her about being an actor.  
    >   
    > We do not find either the original claims, or the clarifications to be credible and have seen no corroboration of her claims that Channel 4 and Love Productions used actors in a reality television show. In contrast, the detailed investigation carried out by Channel 4 gives us confidence that her claims are groundless. We are concerned Ms Dorries appears to have taken an opportunity, under the protection of privilege, to traduce the reputation of Channel 4.`

### 2022 John Penrose, Anti-Corruption Tsar’s Resignation
- On 6 June 2022, Johnson's anti-corruption tsar John Penrose resigns and calls for PM to quit due to the Boris Johnson [[United Kingdom Contents Page]] scandal
    
    > John Penroses Letter: `My reason for stepping down is your public letter last week, replying to your Independent Adviser on the Ministerial Code about the recent Sue Gray Report into ‘partygate’. In it you addressed the concerns over the Fixed Penalty Notice you paid, but not the broader and very serious criticisms of what the Report called ‘failures of leadership and judgment’ and its’ conclusion that ‘senior leadership at the centre, both political and official, must bear responsibility for this culture’. You will know (and your letter to your Adviser on the Ministerial Code explicitly says) that the Nolan Principles of Public Life are absolutely central to the Ministerial Code, and that the seventh of them is ‘Leadership’. So the only fair conclusion to draw from the Sue Gray Report is that you have breached a fundamental principle of the Ministerial Code — a clear resigning matter. But your letter to your Independent Adviser on the Ministerial Code ignores this absolutely central, non-negotiable issue completely. And, if it had addressed it, it is hard to see how it could have reached any other conclusion than that you had broken the code.` [link](https://twitter.com/JohnPenroseNews/status/1533753928483061760/photo/1)

### 2022 Lord Geidt, Johnson’s 2nd Ethics Adviser’s Resignation
- On 15 June 2022, Lord Geidt Resigned his position of Independent Adviser on Ministers' Interests. In his resignation letter, Geidt states:
    
    > `I was asked at length about my recent Annual Report. I alluded to my frustration, as made clear in my Preface, that you had not made any public reference to your own conduct under the Ministerial Code in the period since inquiries were underway. This would be especially important in the event that the Metropolitan Police found against you, which they did, and/or that Sue Gray’s report included criticism of behaviour within the scope of the Ministerial Code, which it did.  
    >   
    > Your letter in response to my Annual Report was welcome. It addressed the absence of comment by you about your obligations under that Ministerial Code up until that point. You explained that, by paying a Fixed Term Penalty, you had not breached the Ministerial Code. The letter did not, however, address specifically the criticism in Sue Gray’s report about your adherence to the Nolan Principles (on leadership, in particular). Neither did the letter make mention that, despite being repeatedly questioned in the House of Commons about your obligations under the Ministerial Code (after paying a Fixed Penalty Notice), your responses again made no reference to it.  
    >   
    > I reported to the Select Committee yesterday that I was satisfied that you had responded to my Annual Report to explain your position. I am disappointed, however, that the account you gave was not fuller, as noted above. Moreover, I regret the reference to ‘miscommunication’ between our offices, with the implication that I was somehow responsible for you not being fully aware of my concerns. These inconsistencies and deficiencies notwithstanding, I believed that it was possible to continue credibly as Independent Adviser, albeit by a very small margin.  
    >   
    > This week, however, I was tasked to offer a view about the Government’s intention to consider measures which risk a deliberate and purposeful breach of the Ministerial Code. This request has placed me in an impossible and odious position. My informal response on Monday was that you and any other Minister should justify openly your position vis-a-vis the Code in such circumstances. However, the idea that a Prime Minister might to any degree be in the business of deliberately breaching his own Code is an affront. A deliberate breach, or even an intention to do so, would be to suspend the provisions of the Code to suit a political end. This would make a mockery not only of respect for the Code but licence the suspension of its provisions in governing the conduct of Her Majesty’s Ministers. I can have no part in this.  
    >   
    > Because of my obligation as a witness in Parliament, this is the first opportunity I have had to act on the Government’s intentions. I therefore resign from this appointment with immediate effect.`

- On 20 June 2022, Culture Minister Nadine Dorries said that Voters don't give a fig about Lord Geidt resigning and replacing him.
    
    > `Asked who should fill Lord Geidt's role, Ms Dorries said: "You call him Lord Geidt. I think the rest of the country had never even heard of him before and called him Lord Geddit."  
    >   
    > "I don’t think they give a fig who replaces him or who he was or what he did. It’s a bit of a bizarre one isn’t it? Someone who wasn’t elected who has resigned."  
    >   
    > "Everybody thought for 24 hours that he was going to resign over something that was going to compromise the Prime Minister, was suddenly blindsided by the fact that it was something to do with steel tariffs."  
    >   
    > "Lord Geddit, Lord Geidt, sorry, he complained so often about the amount of work that he had to do that I don’t think that one person can probably do the job."  
    >   
    > Ms Dorries personal attacks on the peer appear to run counter to the official Downing Street narrative that Lord Geidt fulfilled a "vitally important" position in advising the government on Ministerial Ethics.`

### 2020-23 Chris Pincher Scandal Leading to Johnson’s PM Resignation
### 2020-22 Chris Pincher Scandal
- On 30 June 2022, Pincher resigned as a Government Deputy Chief Whip, after he admitted being very drunk the night before at the private Carlton Club, a private members' club, in St James's, London and having "embarrassed myself and other people". [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-62014765)
- Before appointing him as the chief whip, `The prime minister is said to have referred to the MP as “handsy” and joked about him being “Pincher by name, pincher by nature” as early as 2020.` [[chrispinchergrop]]
- On 3 July 2022, Chris Pincher admission about the incident after reflection.
    
    > "As I told the prime minister, I drank far too much on Wednesday night, embarrassing myself and others, and I am truly sorry for the upset I caused. "The stresses of the last few days, coming on top of those over the last several months, have made me accept that I will benefit from professional medical support. "I am in the process of seeking that now, and I hope to be able to return to my constituency duties as soon as possible." [link](https://www.notion.sobbc.co.uk/news/uk-62023278)
    
- On 3 July 2022, Six new claims of inappropriate behaviour emerge stretching over several years.
    
    > `In fresh allegations this weekend, the Sunday Times reported Mr Pincher had placed his hand on the inner leg of a male Tory MP in a bar in Parliament in 2017. The newspaper reported Mr Pincher also made unwanted advances towards a different male Tory MP in 2018 while in his parliamentary office, and towards a Tory activist in Tamworth around July 2019.` [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-62025612)
    
- On 3 July 2022, Johnson was apparently unaware of such allegations about Pincher.
    
    > `Ms Coffey told the BBC that "to the best of my knowledge" Mr Johnson was not aware of specific allegations about Mr Pincher, saying she had not spoken to the prime minister directly and had received the assurance from the No 10 press office.` [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-62029881)
    
### 2022 Johnson’s Misleading Comments
- On 5 July 2022, it was confirmed that Johnson’s claim that he was not aware of prior specific allegations against Chris Pincher is false as A former top civil servant, Simon McDonald, wrote a formal letter to allege that Downing Street’s version of events was untrue.
    
    > `Five days after Mr Pincher’s resignation as deputy chief whip, there remains significant confusion surrounding complaints about his behaviour prior to the drunkenness he admits at the Carlton Club on 29 June.  
    >   
    > Inaccurate claims by 10 Downing Street continue to be repeated in the media. On 3 July, the BBC website reported: “No official complaints against [Mr Pincher] were ever made.”  
    >   
    > This is not true. In the summer of 2019, shortly after he was appointed minister of state at the Foreign Office, a group of officials complained to me about Mr Pincher’s behaviour. I discussed the matter with the relevant official at the Cabinet Office. (In substance, the allegations were similar to those made about his behaviour at the Carlton Club.) An investigation upheld the complaint; Mr Pincher apologised and promised not to repeat the inappropriate behaviour. There was no repetition at the FCO before he left seven months later.  
    >   
    > The same BBC website report continued: “Downing Street has said Boris Johnson was not aware of any specific allegations when he appointed Mr Pincher deputy chief whip in February.” By 4 July, the BBC website reflected a change in No 10's line: “The prime minister's official spokesman said Mr Johnson knew of ‘allegations that were either resolved or did not progress to a formal complaint’, adding that ‘it was deemed not appropriate to stop an appointment simply because of  
    > unsubstantiated allegations’.”  
    >   
    > The original No 10 line is not true and the modification is still not accurate. Mr Johnson was briefed in person about the initiation and outcome of the investigation. There was a “formal complaint”. Allegations were “resolved” only in the sense that the investigation was completed; Mr Pincher was not exonerated. To characterise the allegations as “unsubstantiated” is therefore wrong.  
    >   
    > I am aware that is unusual to write to you and simultaneously publicise the letter. I am conscious of the duty owed to the target of an investigation but I act out of of my duty towards the victims. Mr Pincher deceived me and others in 2019. He cannot be allowed to use the confidentiality of the process three years ago to pursue his predatory behaviour in other contexts.`  
    > [link](https://twitter.com/SimonMcDonaldUK/status/1544206976820854784/photo/1)
    
- On 5 July 2022, Johnson then apologised later after the letter was published.
    
    > `Boris Johnson has apologised for appointing Chris Pincher as deputy chief whip, saying it "was a mistake" and "in hindsight the wrong thing to do". The prime minister said sorry to "everybody who has been badly affected", adding, "I just want to make absolutely clear that there is no place in this government for anybody who is a predator or who abuses their position of power". He also said: "If I had my time again, I would think back on it and recognise that he wasn't going to learn any lessons and he wasn't going to change and I regret that."` [link](https://news.sky.com/story/boris-johnson-apologises-for-appointing-chris-pincher-as-deputy-chief-whip-and-said-it-was-the-wrong-thing-to-do-12646408)
    
### 2022 Ministerial Resignation Letters
### 5 July
- Rishi Sunak resigned as chancellor. Rishi Sunak’s Letter:
    
    > `That is why I have always tried to compromise in order to deliver the things you want to achieve. On those occasions where I disagreed with you privately, I have supported you publicly.  
    >   
    > That is the nature of the collective government upon which our system relies and it is particularly important that the Prime Minister and Chancellor remain united in hard times such as those we are experiencing today.  
    >   
    > Our country is facing immense challenges. We both want a low-tax, high-growth economy, and world class public services, but this can only be responsibly delivered if we are prepared to work hard, make sacrifices and take difficult decisions.  
    >   
    > I firmly believe the public are ready to hear that truth. Our people know that if something is too good to be true then it’s not true. They need to know that whilst there is a path to a better future, it is not an easy one.  
    >   
    > In preparation for our proposed joint speech on the economy next week, it has become clear to me that our approaches are fundamentally too different.  
    >   
    > I am sad to be leaving Government but I have reluctantly come to the conclusion that we cannot continue like this.`

- Sajid Javid also resigned as Health Secretary. Sajid Javid’s Letter:
    
    > `Conservatives at their best are seen as hard-headed decision-makers, guided by strong values. We may not have always been popular, but we have been competent in acting in the national interest.  
    >   
    > Sadly, in the current circumstances, the public are concluding that we are now neither. The vote of confidence last month showed that a large number of our colleagues agree. It was a moment for humility, grip and new direction.  
    >   
    > I regret to say, however, that it is clear to me that this situation will not change under your leadership – and you have therefore lost my confidence too.`  
    >   
    > ...  
    >   
    > `These are commendable legacies in unprecedented times. But the country needs a strong and principled Conservative Party, and the Party is bigger than any one individual.  
    >   
    > I served you loyally and as a friend, but we all serve the country first. When made to choose between those loyalties there can only be one answer.`

    > `I just don’t think the prime minister any longer has, not just my support, but he doesn’t have, I don’t think, the support of the party, or indeed the country any more`  
    >   
    > ...  
    >   
    > `I think you have to resign because I can’t serve under the prime minister – but I say that with regret because I think this government has done some great things.`  
    > [[bimaf]]
    
- Alex Chalk also resigned as Solicitor General. Alex Chalk’s Letter:
    
    > `With great sadness I am resigning as Solicitor General.  
    >   
    > To be in government is to accept the duty to argue for difficult or even unpopular policy positions where that serves the broader national interest. But it cannot extend to defending the indefensible.  
    >   
    > The cumulative effect of the Owen Paterson debacle, Partygate and now the handling of the former Deputy Chief Whip’s resignation, is that public confidence in the ability of Number 10 to uphold the standards of candour expected of a British Government has irretrievably broken down. I regret that I share that judgement. This comes at a moment of intense challenge for our country, when trust in government can rarely have been more important. I’m afraid the time has therefore come for fresh leadership.`

- Robin Walker also resigned as Minister of State for School Standards. Robin Walker’s Letter:
    
    > `Unfortunately, recent events have made it clear to me that our great party, for which I have campaigned all of my adult life, has become distracted from its core missions by a relentless focus on questions over leadership. The loss of the Rishi Sunak and the Sajid Javid this week, two of our brightest talents from the top team, reflects a worrying narrowing of the broad church that I believe any Conservative Government should seek to achieve.  
    >   
    > I know that you have been an instinctive One Nation Conservative and I have been proud to support you on delivering Brexit with a deal, on supporting our precious union and on the monumental effort to support the lives and livelihoods of so many through the pandemic. Sadly, in recent months those great achievements of your Government have become overshadowed by mistakes and questions about integrity.`

- Victoria Atkins also resigned as Minister of State at the Ministry of Justice. Victoria Atkins’s Letter:
    
    > `Values such as integrity, decency, respect and professionalism should matter to us all. I have watched with growing concern as those values have fractured under your Patterson, Partygate and Pincher. I have given you the benefit of the doubt at each turn, out of loyalty to you as Prime Minister and to our great Party.  
    >   
    > The events of this week, however, have made these contortions impossible. The casual mistreatment of Minister Will Quince and the revelations contained in Lord McDonald's letter highlight just how far your government has fallen from these ideals. I can no longer pirouette around our fractured values. We can and must be better than this.`

- Stuart Andrew also resigned Ministry of Housing. Stuart Andrew’s Letter:
    
    > `Loyalty and unity are traits that I have always endeavoured to provide for our great party. However, I fear I have let these override my judgement recently. There comes a time when you have to look at your own personal integrity and that time is now. Therefore, given recent events I have no other choice than to resign.  
    >   
    > Our party, particularly our members and more importantly our great country, deserve better. Having a marginal seat I have seen the huge sacrifice our members make in volunteering considerable hours to campaign on our behalf and I cannot, in all good conscience, tolerate them having to defend the indefensible.`

    >   
    > However, it has become increasingly clear that the Government cannot function given the issues that have come to light and the way in which they have been handled. In good faith, we must ask that, for the good of the Party and the country, you step aside.`

    >   
    > However, I have regretfully concluded that recent events demonstrate that while you remain ss with this vitally important task.  
    >   
    > The victims of sexual harassment I work with tell me that every single time the biggest obstacle they face in coming forward to tell their heartbreaking and traumatic stories is that they fear they will not be believed, or that the system will cover up for the perpetrator.  
    >   
    > These crimes are almost always about power, because individuals know that the power they have over their victims means they will be protected and can act with impunity.  
    >   
    > I have defended you to the hilt to my constituents and to the public. You have been an incredible leader of our party through some very difficult times but you must now resign for the good of the country and our party.  
    >   
    > Values, principles, integrity and decency matter more than anything and I cannot continue to stand by and do nothing. I ask you now to step aside so that we can get on with the important task of serving the country and providing it with the leadership it so badly needs.`

    > `A No 10 source said: "You can't have a snake who is not with you on any of the big arguments who then gleefully tells the press the leader has to go." The PM rang Mr Gove on Wednesday evening to tell him he was sacked.  
    >   
    > ...  
    >   
    > He told senior MPs on the Commons Liaison Committee it would not be right for him to "walk away" amid economic pressures and the war in Ukraine. And a No 10 source rejected speculation Mr Johnson would announce his resignation in Downing Street on Wednesday, saying the "PM fights on".`

    > You will be remembered as a Prime Minister with energy, vision, determination and humour. There was never a dull moment as a Minister in your Government, and I will be forever grateful to have been given the chance to be part of it.  
    >   
    > I have never been a massive fan of Ministerial resignations being the best means of forcing change. Colleagues have done their upmost in private and public to help you turn the ship around, but it is with sadness that I feel we have passed the point where this is possible.`

    > `I have given you, and those around you, the benefit of the doubt. I have gone out and defended this Government both publicly and privately. We are, however, now past the point of no return. I cannot sacrifice my personal integrity to defend things as they stand now. It is clear that our Party, parliamentary colleagues, volunteers and the whole country, deserve better.  
    >   
    > I delivered my first campaign leaflet as a teenager and the Conservative Party has been hugely influential in my life ever since. In recent weeks and months, we have been relentlessly on the defensive, consumed by introspection and in-fighting. A divided Party cannot win elections. It cannot deliver for those who trusted us with their votes for the first time in 2019.  
    >   
    > A decent and responsible Government relies on honesty, integrity and mutual respect - it is a matter of profound personal regret for me that I must leave Government as I no longer believe those values are being upheld.`

- Damian Hinds also resigned as Security Minister. Damian Hinds Letter:
    
    > `As Prime Minister you have great achievements to your name, not least your leadership in delivering our world-leading vaccination programme, and our support to the people of Ukraine in the face of Putin’s brutality. But more important than any government or leader are the standards we uphold in public life and faith in our democracy and public administration. Because of the serious erosion in these, I have come to the conclusion that the right thing for our country and for our party is for you to stand down as party leader and Prime Minister. I had hoped you would take this course sooner, of your own volition. But as it has become clear that you still intend to stay, I cannot continue to serve in your administration.` [link](https://twitter.com/DamianHinds/status/1544928142854340608/photo/1)
    
- George Freeman also resigned as Science Minister. George Freeman’s Letter:
    
    > `I do this with a very heavy heart. Our country is facing a series of crises and needs strong leadership, and needs Ministers focused on delivering strong and effective government to deliver the priorities for which we won a massive majority only 30 months ago. I backed you then and since because of your commitment to make Brexit an inspiring moment of national renewal - of our economy, Parliamentary sovereignty and our place in the world - in the One Nation Conservative tradition on which you stood.  
    >   
    > As you know I believe very deeply that our science, research, technology, and innovation sector is KEY to unlocking sustainable growth, levelling up and strengthening the UK’s role in the world as a Science & Technology superpower tackling global challenges. For the last six months I have tried to put my responsibilities as Minister of the Crown to this vital mission first and give you the benefit of the doubt over the media storm over “Partygate”.  
    >   
    > But I’m afraid the culmination of your lack of transparency and candour with Parliament (and willingness to ask your Ministers to mislead Parliament), your removal of key pillars of the Ministerial code, your handling of your appointment of a Deputy Chief Whip who it turns out you knew had a history of sexual abuse allegations, is too much. This is seriously damaging public trust and respect for government, democracy and the law, and this great Party’s long tradition as the party of standards, character, conduct, integrity and duty to office and country before partisan self-interest.`

The record of this government, as we have faced the challenges of the Covid pandemic, the war in Ukraine and the consequential impact on the cost of living and inflation is something I am immensely proud to have been a part of. I have backed you throughout these challenges.

### 2022-23 Zahawi, Undeclared Tax Affairs Investigation Leading To Removal Of Chairman Position
- On 5 July 2022, Nadhim Zahawi becomes Chancellor of the Exchequer under Boris Johnson. [link](https://news.sky.com/story/nadhim-zahawi-made-chancellor-after-rishi-sunak-resigns-as-steve-barclay-replaces-sajid-javid-as-health-secretary-12646552)
- On 6 July 2022, The Independent reports that Zahawi had been the subject of an investigation by the NCA, the SFO and HMRC.
    
    > `New chancellor Nadhim Zahawi’s finances were secretly investigated by the National Crime Agency (NCA), The Independent can disclose. A senior serving Whitehall figure has revealed that a number of individuals were formally approached by officials from the NCA about the matter in 2020. The NCA said they were seeking information about multimillionaire Mr Zahawi’s finances, stated the source. The inquiry was codenamed “Operation Catalufa” and is understood to have involved the agency’s International Corruption Unit.` [[chancellornadh]]
    
- On 6 July 2022, The Guardian reports that the Cabinet Office had raised a “red flag” about Zahawi’s tax affairs before his appointment as Chancellor.
    
    > `A “flag” was raised by officials over the financial affairs of the new chancellor, Nadhim Zahawi, before he was promoted, the Observer can reveal. Civil servants in the Cabinet Office’s propriety and ethics team are said to have alerted Boris Johnson to a HM Revenue and Customs “flag” over Zahawi before his appointment. The PM appointed him despite the possible concerns over his tax affairs. “It’s extraordinary that flags were raised ahead of Nadhim’s appointment by the Downing Street proprietary team,” one source said this weekend. “These sorts of concerns would stop someone receiving an MBE or OBE. The idea he could be chancellor or even prime minister is unbelievable”. The revelation comes after a report last week in the Independent that Zahawi was investigated by the National Crime Agency (NCA). The investigation did not lead to any action and there is no suggestion of wrongdoing.` [link](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/09/revealed-officials-raised-flag-over-nadim-zahawis-tax-affairs-before-he-was-appointed-chancellor)
    
- On 10 July 2022, Dan Neidle, Founder of Tax Policy Associates published the estimated calculated tax Zahawi avoided, mostly a gain on YouGov shares which would have been subject to Capital Gains Tax had Zahawi held them, but is tax free in Gibraltar.
    
    > `If Zahawi had held the shares directly, he would have paid about £3.7m of capital gains tax when they were sold in 2017. The trust likely paid no tax. So – unless there is an innocent explanation I am missing – £3.7m of tax was avoided.  
    >   
    > The trust may also avoid UK inheritance tax on assets that ultimately will go to Zahawi’s children. If its assets were just the £24m, that would be almost £10m of inheritance tax avoided. Are there other assets in there? Are the trust assets fully subject to inheritance tax? Again, only Zahawi can clarify this.`

- On 11 July 2022, Zahawi claims he was unaware of the allegations regarding his taxes and said he was being smeared.
    
    > `Nadhim Zahawi has said he is "clearly being smeared" after questions were reportedly raised about his personal finances before his appointment as chancellor. The former education secretary and vaccines minister, who is vying to take over from Boris Johnson, told Sky News he had "always" paid his taxes and had "declared" them in the UK. Should he become prime minister he will publish his accounts annually, he pledged.` [link](https://news.sky.com/story/conservative-leadership-hopeful-nadhim-zahawi-says-he-is-clearly-being-smeared-over-tax-allegations-12649436)
    
    > `Speaking to Sky News presenter Kay Burley, Mr Zahawi said he had been unaware of the allegations. "So I was clearly being smeared. I was being told that the Serious Fraud Office, that the National Crime Agency, that HMRC are looking into me," he said. "I was not aware of this, I have always paid my taxes, I have declared my taxes in the UK." Referring to a possible investigation, Mr Zahawi added: "I will answer any questions that HMRC has of me. "But I will go further: I am going to make a commitment today that if I am prime minister I am going to publish my accounts annually."` [link](https://news.sky.com/story/conservative-leadership-hopeful-nadhim-zahawi-says-he-is-clearly-being-smeared-over-tax-allegations-12649436)
    
- On 13 July 2022, Dan Neidle, Founder of Tax Policy Associates published the reasons as to why Zahawi’s claims don’t line up with the publicly available findings and challenges Zahawi to correct him if he’s gotten it wrong.
    
    > `Zahawi is saying that Balshore got a 45% stake in YouGov because it provided capital to YouGov. There is zero evidence of any capital from Balshore (except, just about possibly, a £91k loan – but that wouldn’t justify a 45% stake). I see only three possibilities:  
    >   
    > 1. I am missing something. What?  
    > 2. Balshore did provide capital, but this was omitted from all of YouGov’s accounts and filings, and not even picked up during the IPO (when financial statements are carefully checked).  
    > 3. Zahawi is lying, and this was tax avoidance.  
    >   
    > I don’t accuse someone of lying frivolously. But Zahawi is making a definitive claim and, right now, there is just no evidence for it. If the answer is indeed that I’ve made a mistake, or the YouGov and Balshore filings are all mistakes, Zahawi should prove it by pointing us towards some actual evidence. Not just making assertions in background briefings to journalists.`

- On 16 July 2022, The Times reported that YouGov themselves denied Zahawi's story, confirming Dan Neidle’s claims.
    
    > `Nadhim Zahawi has been accused of giving a misleading explanation of his tax affairs amid allegations that he may have avoided millions in tax by using an offshore family trust. Before moving into politics, the chancellor made his name in business as one of two co-founders of YouGov, the polling company set up in 2000.` [link](https://archive.ph/AZULP)
    
    > `He said Zahawi’s father had provided £7,000 in start-up capital to YouGov as well as financial support to his son, who had given up his job for the business.  
    >   
    > This explanation now appears to have been undermined YouGov’s company secretary, Tilly Heald, who said that Hareth Zahawi had not advised the business and was merely a shareholder. “To YouGov’s knowledge, YouGov had/has no association with Hareth Zahawi beyond any interests he may have held/holds in Balshore Investments Ltd in its capacity as a YouGov shareholder,” Heald said.  
    >   
    > Employees who worked at YouGov in its early years had no recollection of Zahawi’s father being in the office and were surprised to hear of his alleged involvement with the business.  
    >   
    > According to experts, Zahawi may have avoided tax if he deliberately manoeuvred shares into his father’s offshore company with the intention that he or his family would subsequently benefit through gifts and loans.`

Mr Sunak said there were "questions that need answering" over the case. Tory party chairman Mr Zahawi is facing calls to resign, after it emerged he paid a penalty to HMRC over previously unpaid tax while he was chancellor, as part of a multi-million pound dispute.

    > `Mr Harra, the chief executive of HMRC, gave evidence to the Commons Public Accounts Committee about managing tax compliance following the pandemic. The MPs also quizzed him about Mr Zahawi's tax arrangements. He said he would not comment on specific individuals, but added: "There are no penalties for innocent errors in your tax affairs. So if you take reasonable care, but nevertheless make a mistake, whilst you will be liable for the tax and for interest if it's paid late, you would not be liable for a penalty. "But if your error was as a result of carelessness, then legislation says that a penalty could apply in those circumstances."` [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-64410490)
    
- On 29 January 2023, Sir Laurie Magnus, Independent Ethics Adviser, in a letter to Rishi Sunak found that the Zahawi’s settlement amounted to a breach of the ministerial code.
    
    > `I consider that Mr Zahawi, in holding the high privilege of being a Minister of the Crown, has shown insufficient regard for the general principles of the Ministerial Code and the requirements in particular, under the Seven Principles of Public Life, to be honest, open and an exemplary leader through his own behaviour.  
    >   
    > I want to commend Mr Zahawi for his willingness to assist with my inquiry.

The Sunday Times said the unnamed woman was interviewed for a City Hall job when Mr Johnson was married.

The newspaper reported that the woman was upset by what happened, confronting Mr Johnson about it several years later. She recorded her conversation with the then Foreign Secretary, telling him she was “really shaken and upset” about what had happened and that she regretted their relationship had become sexual. She continued saying his behaviour was an example of how “anyone who steps into this building is fair game” and were there to be “leered at” by powerful men.` [link](https://www.lbc.co.uk/news/boris-johnson-city-hall-job-abuse-of-power-relationship/)

She also copied in someone she thought was Hayes’s wife but was actually an assistant to Andrew Percy, the MP for Brigg and Goole. After taking advice from colleagues, Percy spoke to the chief whip, Wendy Morton, who referred the issue to Case.

- On 31 October 2022, Braverman sent a letter the the Chair of the Home Affair Select Committee explaining the issues surrounding the resignation where Braverman mentioned that she had used her email accounts like this at least six times.
    
    > `Following my referral and subsequent resignation, the Home Office conducted a review of my use of personal email and verified the above sequence of events. The review also identified that within the period between 6th September and 19th October, I had sent official documents from my Government email to my personal email address on six occasions (see Appendix). The review confirmed that all of these occasions occurred in circumstances when I was conducting Home Office meetings virtually or related to public lines to take in interviews. Some of these meetings had been hastily arranged in response to urgent operational matters relating to Home Office priorities. The review also confirmed that on no other occasions had my Special Adviser emailed my personal account in relation to official business.  
    >   
    > ...  
    >   
    > I have been transparent about my mistakes relating to the Ministerial Code. As referenced above, at the heart of the Code lies the principle of responsibility on Ministers, ‘for deciding how to act and conduct themselves in light of the Code and for justifying their actions and conduct to Parliament and the public’ (paragraph 1.6). Of course, the Prime Minister is the ultimate judge of standards and the appropriate consequences of a breach of the standards. There is a range of sanctions including a public apology or remedial action.  
    >   
    > Although the level of risk here was low, the document did not relate to national security or law enforcement matters and the breach was swiftly and proactively reported to officials, I nevertheless decided to take full responsibility by tendering my resignation.  
    >   
    > I am sorry for the errors of judgement set out above and I reiterated my apology to Mr Percy MP yesterday. I hold myself as Home Secretary to the highest possible standards and I am glad to be able to serve again. I am grateful to the Prime Minister for his ongoing confidence following my reappointment.`

### 2022 Andrew Bridgen, Lobbying Breaches
- On 3 November 2022, The House of Commons Committee on Standards found that Bridgen repeatedly breached rules on paid lobbying and declaring interests.
    
    > `It is my view that Mr Bridgen has breached the rules on lobbying when he initiated the approaches summarised in paragraph 98. His approaches sought to confer a financial benefit on Mere Plantations, from whom he had received an outside reward in the form of a funded trip and a donation. The approaches listed above were all made within six months following receipt of those rewards.  
    >   
    > It is my view that Mr Bridgen breached the rules on lobbying when he participated in approaches summarised in paragraph 100. His approaches sought to confer a financial benefit on Mere Plantations, from whom he had received an outside award. The permission in the rule is not triggered as the approaches were initiated by Mr Bridgen and sought to confer a benefit exclusively on Mere Plantations. The approaches listed above were all made within the six months following receipt of those outside rewards.`  
    > [link](https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/31469/documents/176530/default/)
    
- On 26 November 2022, Bridgen appealed against the decision made by the Standards Committee.
    
    > `Tory MP Andrew Bridgen is appealing against his recommended suspension after he was found to have displayed a “very cavalier” attitude to the rules in a series of lobbying breaches. The backbencher was referring the Commons’ Standards Committee’s damning decision to Parliament’s Independent Expert Panel despite previously accepting the findings. At the time the punishment was recommended by the cross-party committee earlier this month, the North West Leicestershire MP said he was “extremely disappointed” with the findings but added “I accept them and will comply with them as required to do so”.` [link](https://www.itv.com/news/central/2022-11-26/tory-mp-andrew-bridgen-appeals-against-lobbying-breach-suspension)
    
- On 20 December 2022, Bridgen appeal= against the decision made by the Standards Committee was rejected.
    
    > `Tory MP Andrew Bridgen has failed in his bid to overturn his recommended five-day suspension for a “very cavalier” series of breaches of lobbying rules. The Independent Expert Panel (IEP) dismissed his appeal “on all grounds” and told the backbencher that he could reasonably have been handed a “more severe” punishment. The North West Leicestershire MP initially accepted the Commons Standards Committee’s findings, before calling for a reversal by Parliament’s appeal panel.` [link](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/andrew-bridgen-commons-mps-b2248585.html)
    
- On 9 January 2023, Bridgen was then suspended for five days from the House of Commons for the breaching paid advocacy rules.
    
    > `The Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen has been suspended from the House of Commons for five days after being found to have breached rules on paid lobbying and declaring interests. The MP for north-west Leicestershire was found to have repeatedly broken the MPs’ code of conduct by a cross-party committee, which endorsed findings from Kathryn Stone, the parliamentary commissioner for standards. He was unsuccessful in an attempt to overturn the recommendation in December and a motion was approved by parliament on Monday.

    > `North West Leicestershire MP Andrew Bridgen has apologised to Parliament for breaching the MPs' code of conduct. Mr Bridgen was suspended from the House of Commons for five days, after he was found to have shown a "careless and cavalier" attitude to the rules. Addressing MPs following his suspension, he said: "I should have been more alert to the rules." He also apologised for a letter to the standards commissioner, which he said he now realised was "inappropriate".` [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-64379330)
    
### 2022 Truss’ PM Resignation
- On 20 October 2022, as a reaction to the [[United Kingdom Contents Page]] controvesy, Liz Truss resigns as Leader of the Conservative Party and therefore Prime Minister after just 44 days in office.
    
    > Liz Truss’ Speech: `We delivered on energy bills and on cutting national insurance.

### 2022 Suella Braverman, Manston Migrant Centre
- On 31 October 2022, it was reported that Braverman didn’t sign off on living accommodation for channel crossing migrants.
    
    > `The source told me that Suella Braverman failed to sign off accommodation and that decision not to take on extra accommodation is going to be potentially very difficult for the home secretary.  
    >   
    > Two Home Office sources told me that the decision is likely to face a judicial review because the law requires that people are held in these conditions for 24 to 48 hours only, when in reality people are being held there for weeks at a time.  
    >   
    > The question for the home secretary will be whether she ignored official advice and did not sign off on accommodation when she should have done.`

### 2022 Gavin Williamson, Bullying Claims Leading to Cabinet Resignation
- On 4 November 2022, Tortoise Media reported that that in October 2022, Wendy Morton had made a formal complaint to the Conservative Party about text messages that Gavin Williamson had sent her on 13 September, during her tenure as Chief Whip under the Liz Truss cabinet.

    >   
    > Wendy Morton, the former chief whip under Liz Truss, has passed on details of “vile and threatening messages” she received in the days before the former prime minister resigned, sources say. One MP said the submission included screen grabs of messages sent by Williamson, himself a former chief whip. He said there was “quite a bit of evidence”, and that a number of MPs were willing to back Morton up. Another suggested there was a misogynistic undertone to the content, with messages sent over the course of several weeks.`

- On 7 November 2022, Sunak refused to sack Williamson over abusive texts to Morton.
    
    > `Rishi Sunak has “full confidence” in the Cabinet Office minister Gavin Williamson despite the emergence of bullying claims and abusive text messages he sent to the former Conservative chief whip Wendy Morton.  
    >   
    > The texts were revealed over the weekend to include angry remonstrations about not being invited to the Queen’s funeral and one that said “there is a price for everything”.  
    >   
    > On Monday the prime minister’s spokesperson said Sunak had a zero-tolerance approach to bullying, but had refused to sack Williamson, claiming he had an “important contribution to make to government”. No 10 has been unable to spell out Williamson’s current responsibilities as a Cabinet Office minister.  
    >   
    > Asked if the prime minister had full confidence in Williamson, the spokesperson said: “Yes.” Pressed on why Sunak gave Williamson a job, he added: “Obviously he thinks he has an important contribution to make to government.”  
    >

- On 20 April 2023, Sunak receives the report into Raab’s conduct.
    
    > `As I said at the outset, this report is the product of my investigation into the facts surrounding the Complaints. It states, to the extent consistent with upholding the principle of confidentiality, my findings of fact. I reiterate the importance, for a proper understanding of the subject-matter, of reading the report as a whole. As set out in paragraphs 53 and 57 above, for the purpose of this investigation under the Ministerial Code, conduct would fall within the description of ‘bullying’ if it can be characterised as:  
    > (1) Offensive, intimidating, malicious or insulting behaviour; or  
    > (2) Abuse or misuse of power in ways that undermine, humiliate, denigrate or injure the recipient  
    >   
    > In summary, I have found as follows:  
    >   
    > (1) In relation to the DExEU Complaint:  
    > (a) The DPM’s conduct cannot be characterised as offensive, malicious or insulting. It was experienced as intimidating, in the sense of excessively demanding. I could not make a finding as to whether it was in fact intimidating in this sense. There was no evidence to suggest any abuse or misuse of power.  
    > (b) The DPM did not intend any adverse effect on others.  
    > (c) No-one drew to the DPM’s attention that his conduct was in any way problematic.  
    > (d) He did not know and could not reasonably have been aware of what is said to have been the impact of his conduct on certain individuals.  
    > (2) In relation to the FCDO Complaint:  
    > (a) The DPM made a legitimate management choice, on the basis of his genuine, adverse view about the work of others (albeit without any grounds for disciplinary action).  
    >   
    > None of the constituent elements of this accepted characterisation of bullying is a legally defined term. All of the words used are capable of a range of interpretations. Where relevant, I have explained the sense in which I have used any of these words.  
    >   
    > (b) In reaching and implementing this management choice he acted in a way which was intimidating, in the sense of unreasonably and persistently aggressive conduct in the context of a work meeting. It also involved an abuse or misuse of power in a way that undermines or humiliates. He introduced an unwarranted punitive element. His conduct was experienced as undermining or humiliating by the affected individual, which was inevitable. It is to be inferred that the DPM was aware that this would be the effect of his conduct; at the very least, he should have been aware.  
    >   
    > (c) On a separate occasion, the DPM referred to the Civil Service Code in a way which could reasonably have been understood as suggesting that those involved had acted in breach. This had a significant adverse effect on a particular individual who took it seriously. The DPM’s conduct was a form of intimidating behaviour, in the sense of conveying a threat of unspecified disciplinary action, and was experienced as such. He did not target any individual, nor intend to threaten anyone with disciplinary action. However, he ought to have realised that his reference to the Civil Service Code could well have been understood as a threat.  
    >   
    > (3) In relation to the MoJ Complaints:  
    >   
    > (a) The significance of the MoJ Group Complaint is that it paved the way for all of the other Complaints. The participants in the MoJ Group Complaint deserve credit for their courage in coming forward. But its composition and content make it unsuitable as a basis for any findings about the DPM’s conduct.  
    >   
    > (b) On a number of occasions at meetings with policy officials, the DPM acted in a manner which was intimidating, in the sense of going further than was necessary or appropriate in delivering critical feedback, and also insulting, in the sense of making unconstructive critical comments about the quality of work done (whether or not as a matter of substance any criticism was justified). By way of example, he complained about the absence of what he referred to as ‘basic information’ or ‘the basics’, about ‘obstructiveness’ on the part of officials whom he perceived to be resistant to his policies, and described some work as ‘utterly useless’ and ‘woeful’.  
    >   
    > (c) The DPM did not intend by the conduct described to upset or humiliate. Nor did he target anyone for a specific type of treatment.  
    >   
    > (d) His interruptive style is not itself behaviour that could be regarded as intimidating or insulting. However, individuals who had previously experienced the DPM express an unconstructive criticism of their work (and understood it as a criticism of them personally) might reasonably have interpreted a series of interruptions as a form of implicit criticism. The combination of unconstructive critical feedback and regular interruption is likely to be experienced as intimidating, in the sense of being unreasonably difficult to deal with, and plainly was so experienced by some individuals.  
    >   
    > (e) The DPM was not aware, nor could he reasonably have been aware, of the impact on individuals in terms of what are said to have been the effects of his behaviour on their health.  
    >   
    > (f) Adopting the language of Dame Sue Owen’s report (while acknowledging that it is not part of the definition accepted in the FDA Case and that both types of conduct may amount to bullying), the DPM’s conduct during the MoJ Period was sometimes ‘abrasive’, in the sense of a personal style which is or feels intimidating or insulting to the individual, but is not intended to be so. His conduct was not, however, ‘abusive’, in the sense of behaviour which is intended and specifically targeted.  
    >   
    > (g) The DPM has been able to regulate this level of ‘abrasiveness’ since the announcement of the investigation. He should have altered his approach earlier.  
    >   
    > (h) Since the investigation was announced, there has not been any valid ground for criticism of the DPM’s conduct.  
    >   
    > In view of the findings of fact, and in light of the Terms of Reference, questions in relation to the Ministerial Code are a matter for the Prime Minister.`

- On 21 April 2023, Raab resigns as Deputy Prime Minister, Justice Secretary and Lord Chancellor.
    
    > Raab’s Resignation Letter:  
    >   
    > `Dear Prime Minister,  
    >   
    > I am writing to resign from your government, following receipt of the report arising from the inquiry conducted by Adam Tolley KC. I called for the inquiry and undertook to resign, if it made any finding of bullying whatsoever. I believe it is important to keep my word.  
    >   
    > It has been a privilege to serve you as deputy prime minister, justice secretary and lord chancellor. I am grateful to have had the opportunity to work as a minister in a range of roles and departments since 2015, and pay tribute to the many outstanding civil servants with whom I have worked.  
    >   
    > Whilst I feel duty bound to accept the outcome of the inquiry, it dismissed all but two of the claims levelled against me. I also believe that its two adverse findings are flawed and set a dangerous precedent for the conduct of good government. First, ministers must be able to exercise direct oversight with respect to senior officials over critical negotiations conducted on behalf of the British people, otherwise the democratic and constitutional principle of ministerial responsibility will be lost. This was particularly true during my time as foreign secretary, in the context of the Brexit negotiations over Gibraltar, when a senior diplomat breached the mandate agreed by cabinet.  
    >   
    > Second, ministers must be able to give direct critical feedback on briefings and submissions to senior officials, in order to set the standards and drive the reform the public expect of us. Of course, this must be done within reasonable bounds. Mr Tolley concluded that I had not once, in four and a half years, sworn or shouted at anyone, let alone thrown anything or otherwise physically intimidated anyone, nor intentionally sought to belittle anyone. I am genuinely sorry for any unintended stress or offence that any officials felt, as a result of the pace, standards and challenge that I brought to the Ministry of Justice. That is, however, what the public expect of ministers working on their behalf.  
    >   
    > In setting the threshold for bullying so low, this inquiry has set a dangerous precedent. It will encourage spurious complaints against ministers, and have a chilling effect on those driving change on behalf of your government - and ultimately the British people.  
    >   
    > Finally, I raised with you a number of improprieties that came to light during the course of this inquiry. They include the systematic leaking of skewed and fabricated claims to the media in breach of the rules of the inquiry and the Civil Service Code of Conduct, and the coercive removal by a senior official of dedicated private secretaries from my Ministry of Justice private office, in October of last year. I hope these will be independently reviewed.  
    >   
    > I remain as supportive of you and this government, as when I first introduced you at your campaign leadership launch last July. You have proved a great prime minister in very challenging times, and you can count on my support from the backbenches.`  
    > [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-65333734)
    
    > Sunaks’ Response:  
    >   
    > `Dear Dominic,  
    >   
    > Thank you for your letter notifying me of your decision to resign from your position in His Majesty's government as deputy prime minister and lord chancellor and secretary of state for justice. It is with great sadness that I have accepted your resignation.  
    >   
    > When I became prime minister in October last year, I pledged that the government I lead would have integrity, professionalism and accountability at every level. The Ministerial Code requires ministers to uphold the highest standards.  
    >   
    > When formal complaints about your conduct in different ministerial posts were submitted last year, I appointed at your request an independent investigator to conduct a full investigation into the specific facts surrounding these complaints. Adam Tolley KC has now submitted his report and I have carefully considered its findings, as well as consulting the independent adviser on minsters' interests.  
    >   
    > As you say, you had - rightly - undertaken to resign if the report made any finding of bullying whatsoever. You have kept your word. But it is clear that there have been shortcomings in the historic process that have negatively affected everyone involved. We should learn from this how to better handle such matters in future.`

### 2022-23 Andrew Bridgen, Suspended For COVID Misinformation, Joins Reclaim Party
- On 13 December 2022, In the Commons, Andrew Bridgen stated his opinion on the negative effect of mRNA Vaccines on the population citing common conspiracy theories and accusing the British Heart Foundation of covering up said negative effects from the public using NDAs.
    
    > `It has also been brought to my attention by a whistleblower from a very reliable source that one of these institutions is covering up clear data that reveals that the mRNA vaccine increases inflammation of the heart arteries. It is covering this up for fear that it may lose funding from the pharmaceutical industry. The lead of that cardiology research department has a prominent leadership role with the British Heart Foundation, and I am disappointed to say that he has sent out non-disclosure agreements to his research team to ensure that this important data never sees the light of day. That is an absolute disgrace. Systemic failure in an over-medicated population also contributes to huge waste of British taxpayers’ money and increasing strain on the NHS.` [link](https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2022-12-13/debates/EAB2E8A2-A721-47DD-A79C-4EFD10F10C2D/VaccinesPotentialHarms?highlight=brought%20attention%20whistleblower%20from%20very%20reliable%20source%20that%20one%20these%20institutions%20covering%20up%20clear%20data%20that%20reveals%20that%20mrna%20vaccine%20increases%20inflammation%20heart%20arteries\#contribution-1DD3E094-94E8-4AD4-A355-8D664AC095F6)

A spokesperson told The Times: “The scientific consensus is that the benefits of Covid-19 vaccination, including a reduced risk of severe illness or death, far outweigh the very small risk of rare side effects like myocarditis or pericarditis for the vast majority of people, especially as people get older. “Scientific evidence shows that Covid-19 itself is much more likely to cause myocarditis than the vaccine is, and people who are vaccinated have a much lower risk of getting other serious complications caused by Covid-19.` [link](https://www.thenational.scot/news/23216791.tory-mps-british-heart-foundation-covid-conspiracy-claims-dismissed/)

However, he failed to apply the same standards of openness and candour in his decision not to divulge this information during the interview process or to this committee during the pre-appointment hearing.  
    >

Richard Sharp chose to tell the then Prime Minister both of his application to Chair the BBC and of his involvement in the arrangement of a loan for the Mr Johnson but decided not to tell either the appointment panel or this Committee about his actions. The Prime Minister, the panel and this Committee are all integral to the appointment process for the Chair of the BBC, but only Mr Johnson was fully aware of Mr Sharp’s potential conflict at the time the appointment was made. The Government, and all those involved in the public appointments process must ensure that the future public appointments process is not clouded by partial disclosure.`

She candidly and transparently drew attention to the fact that she served as Chair of her local Conservative Association from March 2016 to July 2020. She provided evidence that the  
    > Commissioner had approved her to act as a SIPM in a different DCMS appointment process in July 2021 (i.e. he had been satisfied that she was not politically active at that time). It would therefore appear that there was no "significant political activity" which might have caused concern and no reason to doubt that Ms Baxendale (or Ms Cluff) were appropriately appointed to this Panel.

    > Whilst the "independent" element of this Panel was substantially provided by the SIPM, it is recommended that Appointing Authorities (see paragraph 5, Annex A), especially in relation to high profile appointments, ought to have a process to allow Ministers to conclude "whether there are relationships or circumstances which are likely to affect, or could appear to affect the Panellist's judgement" as well as checks on "significant political activity" as above.
