### 2021-23 `Partygate` Scandal
### 2021 Initial Media Reports
- On 30 November 2021, the Daily Mirror first reported on 10 Downing Street staff gatherings during the 2020 Christmas season.
    
    > `Boris Johnson and his Downing Street staff have been accused of breaking Covid rules by attending parties at Number 10 in the run-up to last Christmas. The Prime Minister gave a speech at a packed leaving do for a top aide last November when the country was in the grip of its second lockdown. Then just days before Christmas, with London in tier 3 restrictions, members of his top team held their own festive bash in Downing Street. Officials knocked back glasses of wine during a Christmas quiz and a Secret Santa while the rest of the country was forced to stay at home.` [link](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/boris-johnson-broke-covid-lockdown-25585238)
    
- On 7 December 2021, ITV News released a video, in which Allegra Stratton, the Then-Downing Street Press Secretary, and other Downing Street staff during a mock press conference on 22 December 2020 made joking references to a Christmas gathering in 10 Downing Street four days earlier on 18 December 2020.
    
    > `Ed Oldfield, adviser to the prime minister, asks: “I’ve just seen reports on Twitter that there was a Downing Street Christmas party on Friday night, do you recognise those reports?”  
    >   
    > “I went home”, replies Ms Stratton, laughing, before composing herself, telling colleagues to "hold on", as she appears to consider what her answer should be.  
    >   
    > “Umm, errr, ahhhh,” are the noises she makes as she looks around the room, apparently stuck for words.  
    >   
    > Following a long pause, Mr Oldfield asks: “Would the prime minister condone having a Christmas party?”  
    >   
    > Ms Stratton laughs, looking down, before responding, “what’s the answer?”  
    >   
    > Staff then attempt to help the PM’s former spokesperson formulate a response.  
    >   
    > “It wasn’t a party, it was cheese and wine”, replies one.  
    >   
    > “Is cheese and wine alright?” Ms Stratton asks. At that point the staff member who made the cheese and wine comment seems to say "No... joking".  
    >   
    > Ms Stratton adds “it was a business meeting”, as she laughs again.  
    >   
    > She then warns her colleagues, “this is recorded” and states through more laughter, “this fictional party was a business meeting and it was not socially distanced.”`  
    > [link](https://www.itv.com/news/2021-12-07/no-10-staff-joke-in-leaked-recording-about-christmas-party-they-later-denied)
    
    > `The footage, obtained by ITV, was shot on 22 December 2020. The Friday before was 18 December, the date on which multiple sources have said there was a staff party inside Downing Street, which would have contravened strict Covid regulations in place at the time.` [link](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/07/leaked-video-shows-no-10-officials-joking-about-holding-christmas-party)
    
- On 7 December 2021, The Times reported allegations that the party was organised via WhatsApp with staff requested to bring Secret Santa gifts.
    
    > `An alleged Christmas party in breach of lockdown rules held in Downing Street was organised by civil servants, The Times has been told. The party last year is understood to have been organised via a WhatsApp group with staff asked to bring “Secret Santa” presents. Some of those present also wore Christmas jumpers. About 30 people are understood to have attended the event. Some staff working in other parts of the building are said to have joined in the festivities later in an “impromptu” way. Staff brought the alcohol and food provided, which were not paid for by the government.` [link](https://archive.ph/H5V52)
    
### 2021 Initial Responses to Media Reports
- On 8 December 2021, Johnson apologised for the video during Prime Minister's Questions, describing himself as furious about it, but continued to deny that a party had taken place and declared that an investigation would be undertaken by Cabinet Secretary Simon Case. Johnson also stated that all guidance was followed at all times
    
    > Boris Johnson: `May I begin by saying that I understand and share the anger up and down the country at seeing No. 10 staff seeming to make light of lockdown measures? I can understand how infuriating it must be to think that the people who have been setting the rules have not been following the rules, because I was also furious to see that clip. I apologise unreservedly for the offence that it has caused up and down the country, and I apologise for the impression that it gives.  
    >   
    > I repeat that I have been repeatedly assured since these allegations emerged that there was no party and that no covid rules were broken. That is what I have been repeatedly assured. But I have asked the Cabinet Secretary to establish all the facts and to report back as soon as possible. It goes without saying that if those rules were broken, there will be disciplinary action for all those involved.`

    > Catherine West: `Will the Prime Minister tell the House whether there was a party in Downing Street on 13 November?`  
    >   
    > Boris Johnson: `No, but I am sure that whatever happened, the guidance was followed and the rules were followed at all times.`  
    > [link](https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2021-12-08/debates/45C3B261-14F7-4DDC-A7D8-EB8A76097CFB/Engagements\#contribution-0B32A8C2-7656-483C-8CF2-58452DABBB1F)
    
- Three hours later, Stratton resigned from her position as government spokesperson for the COP26 summit and apologised for her remarks which she asserted she would regret for the rest of her days.
    
    > `Mr Johnson's former press chief Allegra Stratton - who was filmed joking with colleagues about the party in a video leaked to ITV - resigned as a government adviser three hours after the PM's apology. In a tearful statement, she said: "My remarks seemed to make light of the rules, rules that people were doing everything to obey. "That was never my intention. I will regret those remarks for the rest of my days and I offer my profound apologies to all of you at home for them."` [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-59580640) [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-59584736)
    
- On 17 December 2021, it was announced that Case would no longer lead the inquiry following reports that a party had been held in his own office on 17 December 2020. The inquiry was taken over by senior civil servant Sue Gray, Second Permanent Secretary in the Cabinet Office.
    
    > `The UK's top civil servant has stepped aside from his role leading an inquiry into Downing Street lockdown parties, after it emerged an event was held in his own office. Simon Case had been due to report on claims Covid rules were broken at events for staff last year. But his role was put into doubt after reports a party was held in his office while London was under Covid rules. No 10 said the probe would be concluded by senior civil servant Sue Gray.` [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-59701369)
    
### 2022 Police Investigation
- On 24 January 2022, A police inquiry, called Operation Hillman, was started into 12 gatherings on 8 different days.
    
    > `The comments from Number 10 come after the Metropolitan Police announced it was launching an investigation into a "number of" gatherings during COVID-19 restrictions in 2020 and 2021, putting more pressure on the prime minister.  
    >   
    > Speaking in the Commons, Mr Johnson told MPs: "I welcome the Met's decision to conduct its own investigation because I believe this will help to give the public the clarity it needs and help to draw a line under matters."`  
    > [link](https://news.sky.com/story/met-launches-investigation-into-a-number-of-downing-street-events-12524866)
    
- On 19 May 2022, the Metropolitan Police said that they had completed their investigations, with the police concluding that offences were committed on 8 different dates.
    
    > `In total, detectives have made 126 referrals for fixed penalty notices (FPNs) to the ACRO Criminal Records Office for breaches of Covid-19 regulations.`  
    >   
    > ...  
    >   
    > `Of the referrals, all resulted or will do so in a FPN being issued. In total, this refers to 83 individuals. The breakdown of recipients is 53 FPNs were issued to 35 men and 73 FPNs to 48 women. A total of 28 people received between two and five referrals.`  
    >   
    > ...  
    >   
    > `Acting Deputy Commissioner Helen Ball, of the Met said: “There is no doubt that the pandemic impacted all of us in so many ways and strong feelings and opinions have been expressed on this particular issue. When Covid regulations were introduced, the Met was clear that whilst we would not routinely investigate breaches of regulations retrospectively, there may be occasions when it would be appropriate to do so. The information that we received with regard to the alleged breaches in Downing Street and Whitehall was sufficient to reach our criteria to begin such an investigation. Our investigation was thorough and impartial and was completed as quickly as we could, given the amount of information that needed to be reviewed and the importance of ensuring that we had strong evidence for each FPN referral. This investigation is now complete.”`

### 2022 Interim Sue Gray Report
- On 31 January 2022, Due to their being an ongoing Police Investigation, Sue Gray released an initial update report on `Investigation Into Alleged Gatherings on Government Premises During Covid Restrictions`. [link](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1051374/Investigation_into_alleged_gatherings_on_government_premises_during_Covid_restrictions_-_Update.pdf)
    
    > `Against the backdrop of the pandemic, when the Government was asking citizens to accept far-reaching restrictions on their lives, some of the behaviour surrounding these gatherings is difficult to justify.`
    
    > `At least some of the gatherings in question represent a serious failure to observe not just the high standards expected of those working at the heart of Government but also of the standards expected of the entire British population at the time.`
    
    > `At times it seems there was too little thought given to what was happening across the country in considering the appropriateness of some of these gatherings, the risks they presented to public health and how they might appear  
    > to the public. There were failures of leadership and judgment by different parts of No 10 and the Cabinet Office at different times. Some of the events should not have been allowed to take place. Other events should not have been  
    > allowed to develop as they did.`  
    
    > `The excessive consumption of alcohol is not appropriate in a professional workplace at any time. Steps must be taken to ensure that every Government Department has a clear and robust policy in place covering the consumption of alcohol in the workplace.`
    
    > `The use of the garden at No 10 Downing Street should be primarily for the Prime Minister and the private residents of No 10 and No 11 Downing Street. During the pandemic it was often used as an extension of the workplace as a  
    > more covid secure means of holding group meetings in a ventilated space. This was a sensible measure that staff appreciated, but the garden was also used for gatherings without clear authorisation or oversight. This was not  
    > appropriate. Any official access to the space, including for meetings, should be by invitation only and in a controlled environment.`  
    
    > `Some staff wanted to raise concerns about behaviours they witnessed at work but at times felt unable to do so. No member of staff should feel unable to report or challenge poor conduct where they witness it. There should be easier ways for staff to raise such concerns informally, outside of the line management chain.`
    
    > `The gatherings within the scope of this investigation are spread over a 20-month period – a period that has been unique in recent times in terms of the complexity and breadth of the demands on public servants and indeed the general public. The whole of the country rose to the challenge. Ministers, special advisers and the Civil Service, of which I am proud to be a part, were a key and dedicated part of that national effort. However, as I have noted, a number of these gatherings should not have been allowed to take place or to develop in the way that they did. There is significant learning to be drawn from these events which must be addressed immediately across Government. This does not need to wait for the police investigations to be concluded.`
    
### 2022 Full Sue Gray Report
- On 25 May 2022, Sue Gray released the full report on `Findings Of Second Permanent Secretary’s Investigation Into Alleged Gatherings On Government Premises During Covid Restrictions`.
    - 15 May 2020; a photograph showing a number of groups in the garden of No 10 Downing Street
        
        > `there is no reason to suggest that this was anything other than a further work meeting.` [[p9]](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1078404/2022-05-25_FINAL_FINDINGS_OF_SECOND_PERMANENT_SECRETARY_INTO_ALLEGED_GATHERINGS.pdf)
        
    - 20 May 2020; a gathering in the garden of No 10 Downing Street for No 10 staff
        
        > `A No 10 Director declined the invitation and told the investigation that they had raised with either Martin Reynolds or his office that it was not a good idea. Lee Cain, the then No 10 Director of Communications (a special adviser), also received the invitation. In response, he emailed Martin Reynolds, No 10 official (1), and Dominic Cummings at 14.35 on 20 May 2020 stating: ‘I’m sure it will be fine - and I applaud the gesture - but a 200 odd person invitation for drinks in the garden of no 10 is somewhat of a comms risk in the current environment.’ Lee Cain says he subsequently spoke to Martin Reynolds and advised him that the event should be cancelled. Martin Reynolds does not recall any such conversation. In addition, Dominic Cummings has also said that he too raised concerns, in writing. We have not found any documentary evidence of this.` [[p11/12]](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1078404/2022-05-25_FINAL_FINDINGS_OF_SECOND_PERMANENT_SECRETARY_INTO_ALLEGED_GATHERINGS.pdf)
        
        > `This event was also referenced in a subsequent Whatsapp message on an unknown date from Martin Reynolds to a special adviser: [Martin Reynolds] [19:36] 'Best of luck - a complete non story but better than them focusing on our drinks (which we seem to have got away with).'` [[p12/13]](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1078404/2022-05-25_FINAL_FINDINGS_OF_SECOND_PERMANENT_SECRETARY_INTO_ALLEGED_GATHERINGS.pdf)
        
    - 18 June 2020: a gathering in the Cabinet Office, 70 Whitehall on the departure of a No 10 official

On 12 June there was an exchange of WhatsApp messages between the two that read: [Martin Reynolds] [18:31] “No 10 official (1)’s leaving drinks next week - can we discuss handling!” [Lee Cain] [18:32] “Yes - not sure how we do it but want to do something” [Martin Reynolds] [19:01] “Ils it safer to do a larger event indoors but with some people carrying on outside afterwards?” [Lee Cain] [19:20] “I’m not sure it works at all to be honest, which would be a shame. | don’t see how we can have some kind of party though” [Martin Reynolds] [19:23] “So you are saying nothing for [No 10 official (1)]?” [Lee Cain [18:32] “I think it’s your decision my friend, not mind [sic]!

They joined the other members of the Private Office, including No 10 official (1), already in the waiting room. Some brought pizza and prosecco and they were followed by others, over the next couple of hours. Helen MacNamara, Deputy Cabinet Secretary, attended for part of the evening and provided a karaoke machine which was set up in an adjoining office to the waiting room.` [[p15]](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1078404/2022-05-25_FINAL_FINDINGS_OF_SECOND_PERMANENT_SECRETARY_INTO_ALLEGED_GATHERINGS.pdf)
        
        > `The event lasted for a number of hours. There was excessive alcohol consumption by some individuals. One individual was sick. There was a minor altercation between two other individuals.

        > `On the morning of 19 June 2020, Cleo Watson, a No 10 special adviser who informed the investigation that she had been asked to organise the event, had an exchange of Whatsapp messages with Martin Reynolds, Principal Private Secretary to the Prime Minister messages as follows: [Cleo Watson] [09:09] “Hi! PM birthday today - we’ve organised some sandwiches and cake for about 1pm in the Cabinet Room if anyone from your team would like to pop in and wish him a happy birthday....” [Cleo Watson] [09:09] “Have sent this to policy, press and e&v heads.

        > `The Prime Minister was not aware of this event in advance and it did not form part of his official diary for the day. He returned from an external visit to No 10 Downing Street at approximately 14.20 and was taken into the Cabinet Room which had been set up with sandwiches, snacks, soft drinks and cans of beer. Those attending included No 10 officials and Mrs. Johnson. The Permanent Secretary for Covid and Pandemic Response, Simon Case, attended for a short period having arrived early for a meeting which was due to take place in the Cabinet room. The Chancellor was also there briefly having also arrived early for the same meeting. He had no advance knowledge about what had been planned. The event lasted between 14.25 and 14.45, throughout which the Prime Minister was present. Those attending consumed food and drink, and some drank alcohol.

        > `Following the announcement of the departure of Dominic Cummings and Lee Cain, a meeting was held in the No 10 flat from some time after 18.00 to discuss the handling of their departure. Five special advisers attended. The Prime Minister joined them at about 20.00. Food and alcohol were available. The discussion carried on later into the evening with attendees leaving at various points. The information collected on this gathering is limited as the process of obtaining evidence had only just been commenced when the Metropolitan Police announced their own investigations, which included events on the 13 November 2020. At this point I stopped my investigation, given the need to avoid any prejudice to the police investigation. Following the Metropolitan Police announcement on 19 May 2022 I considered whether or not to conduct any further investigation into this event but concluded it was not appropriate or proportionate to do so.` [[p18]](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1078404/2022-05-25_FINAL_FINDINGS_OF_SECOND_PERMANENT_SECRETARY_INTO_ALLEGED_GATHERINGS.pdf)

Some staff drank alcohol. A No 10 official sent a message on internal No 10 systems referring to ‘drunkenness’ and advising staff to leave No 10 via the back exit. The No 10 official informed the investigation team that they did this in order to avoid staff being photographed by the press outside. The quiz finished at approximately 21.30. Most of those in the office in No 10 either left or returned to work after the quiz with some remaining continuing to chat and some drank alcohol.` [[p23]](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1078404/2022-05-25_FINAL_FINDINGS_OF_SECOND_PERMANENT_SECRETARY_INTO_ALLEGED_GATHERINGS.pdf)

In the week before the event there was a discussion with the Second Permanent Secretary, James Bowler, about the planned event. He said that it could take place on the basis that it was time limited, that no one was to travel into the office specially and that it should be socially distanced. The Cabinet Office Covid Taskforce operated largely on a work from home basis with the exception of some key staff, mostly senior civil servants who attended the office in 70 Whitehall.

It lasted for around an hour and there were approximately 45 people in total in attendance both in the office and with a small number online.

    - Conclusions of the Report
        
        > `Whatever the initial intent, what took place at many of these gatherings and the way in which they developed was not in line with Covid guidance at the time. Even allowing for the extraordinary pressures officials and advisers were under, the factual findings of this report illustrate some attitudes and behaviours inconsistent with that guidance. It is also clear, from the outcome of the police investigation, that a large number of individuals (83) who attended these events breached Covid regulations and therefore Covid guidance.` [[p36]](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1078404/2022-05-25_FINAL_FINDINGS_OF_SECOND_PERMANENT_SECRETARY_INTO_ALLEGED_GATHERINGS.pdf)
        
        > `The events that I investigated were attended by leaders in government. Many of these events should not have been allowed to happen. It is also the case that some of the more junior civil servants believed that their involvement in some of these events was permitted given the attendance of senior leaders. The senior leadership at the centre, both political and official, must bear responsibility for this culture.` [[p36]](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1078404/2022-05-25_FINAL_FINDINGS_OF_SECOND_PERMANENT_SECRETARY_INTO_ALLEGED_GATHERINGS.pdf)
        
        > `I found that some staff had witnessed or been subjected to behaviours at work which they had felt concerned about but at times felt unable to raise properly. I was made aware of multiple examples of a lack of respect and poor treatment of security and cleaning staff. This was unacceptable.` [[p36]](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1078404/2022-05-25_FINAL_FINDINGS_OF_SECOND_PERMANENT_SECRETARY_INTO_ALLEGED_GATHERINGS.pdf)

### 2022 Lord Geidt’s Reaction
- On 31 May 2022, Lord Geidt, the Government's independent adviser on ministers' interests, published his annual report.
    
    > `In the case of the Fixed Penalty Notice recently issued to and paid by the Prime Minister, a legitimate question has arisen as to whether those facts alone might have constituted a breach of the overarching duty within the Ministerial Code of complying with the law. It may be that the Prime Minister considers that no such breach of his Ministerial Code has occurred. In that case, I believe a Prime Minister should respond accordingly, setting out his case in public.  
    >   
    > Such a circular process could only risk placing the Ministerial Code in a place of ridicule. Instead, and since the point when the inquiries by the Cabinet Secretary (later conducted by the Second Permanent Secretary) and the Metropolitan Police were embarked upon, I have repeatedly counselled the Prime Minister’s official and political advisers that the Prime Minister should be ready to offer public comment on his obligations under the Ministerial Code, even if he has judged himself not to be in breach. This has been my standing advice, which I was assured had been conveyed to the Prime Minister. Its purpose has simply been to ensure that the Prime Minister should publicly be seen to take responsibility for his own conduct under his own Ministerial Code. That advice has not been heeded and, in relation to the allegations about unlawful gatherings in Downing Street, the Prime Minister has made not a single public reference to the Ministerial Code.`  
    > [link](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1080213/independent-adviser-annual-report.pdf)
    
- On 31 May 2022, As requested by Lord Geidt, Johnson then made his case to Lord Geidt public in which he blamed a possible failure of communication between Johnson and Lord Geidt, that Johnson had taken full responsibility and stated that the fixed penalty notice was not a criminal conviction.
    
    > `When we spoke earlier today, you confirmed that you had not raised with me directly your advice to make a public comment, nor were you asking me to adjudicate on the Ministerial Code. Notwithstanding, I understand your frustration that there may have been a failure of communication between our offices, such that I was not aware of the weight you put on the absence of an explicit reference to the Ministerial Code.  
    >   
    > ...  
    >   
    > As you know, I have previously sought your independent advice, and acted upon it, in order to ensure that my responsibilities under the Code were properly discharged. Turning to recent events, I have taken full responsibility for everything that took place on my watch, and reiterate my apology to the House and to the whole country in respect of the gathering on 19 June in the Cabinet Room for which I received a fixed penalty notice.  
    >   
    > I have also been clear that there was no intent to break the regulations; at the time I did not consider that the circumstances in which I received a fixed penalty notice were contrary to the regulations. I have accepted the outcome and paid it in compliance with legal requirements. Paying a fixed penalty notice is not a criminal conviction. I have corrected the record in Parliament, where it transpired that the information I previously conveyed in good faith was not ultimately correct: this correction to Parliament is in line with the Ministerial Code.`

### 2023 Johnson Resigns as Member of Parliament
- On 9 June 2023, after receiving a confidential report from the Privileges Committee of the House of Commons that was looking into whether he had intentionally misled Parliament over lockdown-breaking parties in Downing Street during the COVID-19 pandemic, Johnson announced his resignation as MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip, triggering a by-election.
    
    > `Boris Johnson has announced he is standing down as an MP with immediate effect after receiving the report into whether he lied to MPs over partygate.  
    >   
    > In an excoriating statement, the former prime minister said a letter from the privileges committee made clear "that they are determined to use the proceedings against me to drive me out of parliament".  
    >   
    > As a result, Mr Johnson said: "I have written to my association in Uxbridge and South Ruislip to say that I am stepping down forthwith and triggering an immediate by-election.  
    >   
    > "I am very sorry to leave my wonderful constituency. It has been a huge honour to serve them, both as Mayor and MP."`

### 2023 Privileges Committee Report on Johnson
- On 15 June 2023, The House of Commons Committee of Privileges released a report on `Matter referred on 21 April 2022 (conduct of Rt Hon Boris Johnson): Final Report`.
    
    > `Using the categories of misleading set out in paragraph 32 of the Fourth Report, we conclude that:  
    >   
    > a) Mr Johnson misled the House when he said on 1 December 2021 that all Guidance was followed completely in No. 10, when he said on 8 December 2021 that the Rules and Guidance were followed at all times, on 12 January 2022 when he said that events at No. 10 were within the Rules and Guidance, and on 25 May 2022 when he said that the Rules and Guidance had been followed at all times when he was present at gatherings to wish staff farewell. See paragraph 117.  
    >   
    > b) Mr Johnson misled the House when he failed to tell the House about his own knowledge of the gatherings where the Rules or Guidance had been broken. See paragraphs 23 to 94.  
    >   
    > c) Mr Johnson misled the House when he said on 8 December 2021 that he relied upon repeated assurances that the rules had not been broken. There is evidence that Mr Johnson was assured by two individuals who had worked at No. 10 at the time that they did not think the gathering of 18 December 2020 had broken Covid rules–see paragraphs 136 to 144, and 176. However, we conclude that:  
    >   
    > i) Mr Johnson had personal knowledge about gatherings which he should have disclosed. See paragraphs 23 to 94.  
    >   
    > ii) Mr Johnson concedes that there was no assurance about any gathering’s compliance with the guidance that was in place at the time (as opposed to compliance with the Covid rules), yet Mr Johnson gave the House the impression that those assurances had been overarching and comprehensive in respect of No. 10’s compliance with all Covid measures. See paragraphs 144, 146, 161, and 180 to 183.  
    >   
    > iii) The purported assurances were only about the gathering of 18 December 2020, not more generally about No. 10’s compliance with the Rules and Guidance, yet Mr Johnson gave the House the impression that those assurances had been overarching and comprehensive in respect of No. 10’s compliance with Covid measures across the whole period of restrictions. In particular, we have received no evidence that any specific assurance was provided in relation to the gatherings of 20 May 2020, 19 June 2020, 13 November 2020, 27 November 2020 and 14 January 2021 which we have examined in detail. See paragraphs 145, and 180 to 183.  
    >   
    > iv) The context for the initial purported assurance was in response to a media inquiry and the assertion that Covid rules were followed was initially developed in haste, and without further investigation, as a media line to take. They were therefore not appropriate for Mr Johnson to cite as an authoritative indication of No. 10’s compliance with Covid measures. See paragraphs 137 to 141.  
    >   
    > The only two purported assurances for which there is firm evidence did not emanate from senior permanent civil servants or government lawyers but from two media advisers, one of whom was a personal political appointment by Mr Johnson. The purported assurances consisted only of what those individuals themselves believed about the compliance of the gathering of 18 December 2020 with the Rules. They were therefore not appropriate to be cited as an authoritative indication of No. 10’s compliance with Covid measures. See paragraphs 139 to 144, 163 to 165, and 176 to 178.  
    >   
    > d) Mr Johnson misled the House when he gave the impression that there needed to be an investigation by the Second Permanent Secretary to establish whether the rules and guidance had been broken before he could answer questions to the House. While repeatedly making that statement to the House, he had personal knowledge that he did not reveal. See paragraphs 23 to 94, and 127.  
    >   
    > e) We additionally find that Mr Johnson misled the House when he purported to correct the record on 25 May 2022. We have concluded above that his statement on that date that the Covid Rules and Guidance were followed while he was in attendance at farewell gatherings at No. 10 was misleading. As such, it represented a continuation of his previous misleading of the House, and seeking to present it as a correction was itself misleading. His insistence on the truthfulness of this statement in his written evidence, and his refusal to correct the record when invited to do so during his oral evidence on 22 March 2023, is a further misleading. See paragraphs 131 and 187.  
    >   
    > 189. We further conclude that Mr Johnson has been disingenuous with the Committee in ways which amount to misleading, as follows:  
    >   
    > a) By adopting a narrow and restricted interpretation of the assertions he gave to the House in PMQs on 1 and 8 December 2021 which is at odds with the general impression he clearly wished to give in the House that all Rules and Guidance at No. 10 had been followed at all times. See paragraphs 180 to 183.  
    >   
    > b) By claiming that when he referred to having been repeatedly assured, by “repeatedly” he had meant merely “on more than one occasion”. We note that this is contrary to common English usage. It is clear that when Mr Johnson used the term “repeatedly” at PMQs, he wished his audience to suppose that there had been multiple occasions at which assurances had been given, rather than merely more than one, and, as suggested by our evidence, possibly as few as two. See paragraph 134.  
    >   
    > c) By undertaking to provide the Committee with the name of another person who had provided assurances, and then failing to do so. See paragraphs 167 to 169.  
    >   
    > d) By stating at the oral evidence session that the Committee had withheld from publication “the evidence that I rely on, which answers the charges” and “a large number of extracts which I rely upon in my defence”, but then, when the Committee had facilitated the production of that evidence accompanied by statements of truth, failing to make any use of it in his subsequent final submission. This strongly suggests that Mr Johnson did not “rely on” the evidence at all but was simply using it as a gambit to criticise the Committee in the public hearing. See paragraph 220.  
    >   
    > e) By advancing an unsustainable interpretation of Guidance in order that he can deny the implications of the evidence showing a lack of social distancing. See paragraphs 99 to 102, and 115 to 116.  
    >   
    > f) By being unable to deny that he said the words “probably the most unsocially distanced gathering in the UK right now” while not admitting that he said them, which has the ring of avoidance about it. See paragraphs 68 to 69.`

### 2022 Johnson’s Comments On Starmer & Saville
- On 31 January 2022, In the House of Commons, Johnson falsely blamed Starmer for the non-prosecution of serial sex offender Jimmy Savile when Starmer was Director of Public Prosecutions in the Crown Prosecution Service.
- On 3 February 2022, A Downing Street source said that Johnson still would not apologise for the slur against Starmer.
    
    > `No 10 has no intention of apologising for the PM's false claim that Sir Keir Starmer failed to prosecute Jimmy Savile, after the Labour leader was targeted by protesters near Parliament. Boris Johnson is facing fresh calls from Tory MPs to say sorry, after protesters were heard shouting about the sex offender, as well as protesting about Covid measures. But a senior source told the BBC: "He's got other stuff to get on with today." Mr Johnson did condemn the harassment.` [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-60297998)
    
- On 3 February 2022, Johnson policy adviser Munira Mirza resigned saying in her resignation letter that Johnson had made a scurrilous and inappropriate accusation against Starmer.
    
    > `It is with great regret that I am writing to resign as your Head of Policy.  
    >   
    > You are aware of the reason for my decision: I believe it was wrong for you to imply this week that Keir Starmer was personally responsible for allowing Jimmy Savile to escape justice. There was no fair or reasonable basis for that assertion. This was not the usual cut and thrust of politics; it was an inappropriate and partisan reference to a horrendous case of child sex abuse. You tried to clarify your position today but, despite my urging, you did not apologise for the misleading impression you gave.`  
    > [link](https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/exclusive-boris-s-policy-chief-quits-over-jimmy-savile-slur)
    
- In 2012, when he was Director of Public Prosecutions, Starmer commissioned a report from Alison Levitt QC called `In The Matter Of The Late Jimmy Saville` into why Savile was not prosecuted.
    
    > `One of the decisions not to prosecute was correct, but not for the reason given. No prosecution could have taken place on the evidence of Ms G because the behaviour complained of did not amount to a criminal offence. Ms G’s alleged unwillingness to give evidence was therefore immaterial.`
    
    > `In relation to the three other allegations, on the information available these were credible complaints of criminal offences based on reliable evidence. However, all three alleged victims had expressed unwillingness to attend court.`
    
    > `Taken at face value, the decisions not to prosecute in the cases of Ms E and Ms A were not unreasonable, for these reasons: there was insufficient other evidence to prosecute in the absence of the complainants’ accounts; an application to adduce their evidence under the hearsay provisions of Part 11 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 would, in my view, have failed, and issuing a witness summons against a reluctant witness in these sensitive cases must always be a matter of last resort.` [link](https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukgwa/20130703165341/http:/www.cps.gov.uk/news/assets/uploads/files/savile_report.pdf)
    
### 2022-23 David Warburton, Whip Suspended for Multiple Misconduct Allegations
- On 2 April 2022, Conservative MP David Warburton had been suspended from the parliamentary party pending an investigation into allegations about sexual and other misconduct. Warburton was admitted to a psychiatric hospital. His wife said he was suffering from severe shock and stress following the allegations.
    
    > `MP David Warburton has been admitted to a psychiatric hospital after a parliamentary investigation was launched into his conduct, his wife has told the BBC.

    >   
    > The Conservative whips office said he had been suspended from the parliamentary party while the investigation was ongoing.  
    >   
    > Conservative sources said there were three allegations of sexual harassment. The investigation was launched by the Parliament's Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS) following allegations about Mr Warburton's conduct in the Sunday Times newspaper.  
    >   
    > The newspaper said three women have complained about Mr Warburton's conduct.`  
    > [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-60975624)
    
- On 2 April 2022, The Sunday Times released an article about the sex and drugs allegations. [link](https://archive.ph/gu3gw)
    - Warburton allegedly asked Woman 1 for cocaine to be bought on his behalf.
        
        > `He is said to have snorted “line after line after line” of the drug at the London home of a younger woman in the early hours of February 1. He had met her through politics and allegedly insisted on coming over, despite evidence that she was drunk.  
        >   
        > Hours earlier Warburton, a 56-year-old married father of two and former businessman, had asked the woman to order the class A drugs on his behalf, telling her he would pay for them. According to an audio recording, he dismissed the suggestion that paying £160 for two grams was “spenny” — expensive — and said it was “quite good actually”.`  
        
    - Warburton allegedly, also made unwanted sexual advancements towards Woman 1.
        
        > `She recounts that as she became less drunk she grew uncomfortable that the pair were alone together and retreated to her bedroom to put on her pyjamas in an attempt to encourage his departure. When she emerged, she says, Warburton was naked. He allegedly explained that he always slept nude and climbed into her bed. Fearful of how he might react, she did not push him away, she says, or demand that he leave.  
        >   
        > Despite her repeated and explicit warnings, before and during his visit, that she did not want to have sex with him or do anything sexual, Warburton allegedly ground his body against hers and groped her breasts. The woman says she lay frozen until the MP fell asleep, snoring loudly.  
        >   
        > The following morning Warburton is said to have woken up and asked her if she was “proud” that an MP had slept at her home. She says she showed him the door, then had a long shower. She felt ashamed and violated. At 1.50pm he sent her a WhatsApp message asking if she was available and stating: “Promise I won’t remove all my clothes again.” The pair have not met since.  
        >   
        > The woman did not make a complaint to the police or any other authority. She says Warburton was a powerful man and she would not have known which course of action to take. She also says she wanted to forget about the incident.`  
        
    - Warburton allegedly had received a large donation that wasn't declared from a FCA limited Russian Financial Adviser.
        
        > `He borrowed £100,000 from a Russian businessman without declaring it, a decision that could lead to an investigation by the parliamentary commissioner for standards.  
        >   
        > The man who lent him the money is Roman Joukovski, a financial adviser who has specialised in offshore tax advice and providing tier-one “golden” investor visas to foreign citizens, including oligarchs and the family of Kazakhstan’s dictator Nursultan Nazarbayev. In 2014 the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) refused to certify him as a “fit and proper person”, limiting his ability to provide certain kinds of financial advice, and one of his businesses was recently forced into insolvency after a separate FCA ruling.  
        >   
        > Warburton knew about Joukovski’s past problems with the regulator, but took the loan via an offshore entity linked to the businessman’s family trust. He later brought the Russian-born British citizen into the Palace of Westminster and used his parliamentary email address to organise meetings for Joukovski, including one with Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Brexit opportunities secretary, who was a backbencher at the time in 2017. According to a source with direct knowledge of the transaction, Warburton has since repaid the money at high levels of interest.  
        >   
        > Parliamentary rules state that MPs must register an interest, in this case a loan, within 28 days if it has any bearing on their parliamentary activities. If an MP has any doubt about whether an interest should be declared, they are advised to do so. At no point has Warburton disclosed any details of his financial relationship with Joukovski.`  
        
    - During the pandemic, Warburton was using more cocaine and involved in more incidents of Warburton being sexually inappropriate to Woman 2 and Woman 3.
        
        > `During the pandemic, Warburton’s life changed. He increasingly spent time away from home, in his taxpayer-funded flat in County Hall, across the Thames from parliament. His wife remained in Somerset caring for their children. Then, in January last year, Warburton posted a photograph revealing he had lost eight stone by lifting weights and avoiding carbohydrates. His selfie prompted congratulations from the prime minister, the health secretary and others.  
        >   
        > Warburton was living increasingly recklessly. He started sending suggestive texts to at least one younger woman whom he had met through politics but did not work for him last year. It also appears that he took cocaine, writing to the woman in November to say: “Yep have some cheeky coke obvs.” Last month he texted her saying: “Does your dealer do Westminster Bridge area!?” He added: “Have just been put on a one line-whip” — meaning that he was not obliged to participate in votes in the Commons that day — “so your happy Monday has made me want to call my dealer ... but he takes aeons.”  
        >   
        > The two women who have reported him allege that Warburton started behaving inappropriately towards them too, both in parliament and at late-night events in and around Westminster. The conduct varied in its severity. He is said to have subjected one female aide to months of sexualised comments, telling her he would have slept with her had they been the same age and refusing to stop calling her “baby”. At the British Kebab awards, a boozy event in Westminster attended by MPs and young researchers, he allegedly groped her thigh in an incident witnessed by another person.  
        >   
        > The two women allege that Warburton pressured them into drinking more alcohol than they were comfortable with and that he coerced them into returning to his flat. In one incident alleged to have taken place this year, he told an aide to return with him to the property, where, against her will, he allegedly kissed her forehead, stroked her hair, placed his hand on her thigh and repeatedly rubbed it. The other female staff member recounted an incident in which he had caressed her and refused to let her leave his home, marshalling her back inside when she sought to leave.`  
        
- On 21 November 2022, Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, Kathryn Stone, found that there were two breaches of the code of conduct but the breaches had been rectified after Warburton wrote to Stone.
    
    > `During my inquiry, I established that the loan had been provided to Mr Warburton by Mr Roman Joukovski in August 2017 through an intermediary company, Castlebrook Associates Limited (Seychelles). I also established that the loan was for a personal matter and was not provided on a free or concessionary basis. My inquiry established that during the period that the loan was active (it was repaid in March 2022), Mr Warburton assisted Mr Joukovski in his dealings with the FCA. I determined that this assistance was provided in a personal capacity. I was also satisfied on the evidence that the loan had not influenced Mr Warburton's words or actions as a Member.  
    >   
    > Mr Warburton told me that he did not register the loan at the time because it was “…entirely unconnected with either my role as an MP or any parliamentary activities” and also told me "in no way did (the loan) ever influence my words or actions as a Member. Nor could it have done".  
    >   
    > After taking advice from the Registrar of Members' Financial Interests, I concluded that the loan should have been registered under Category 8 of the Register of Members' Financial Interests as a miscellaneous financial interest. I reached this conclusion because an onlooker might have reasonably thought that at the time the loan was provided it had the potential to influence Mr Warburton's words or actions as a Member. I decided that the failure to register the loan amounted to a breach of paragraph 14 of the Code.  
    >   
    > I also concluded that the loan should have been declared when Mr Warburton wrote to the FCA about Mr Joukovski on 12 March 2021. This is because an onlooker might reasonably have thought that the loan was either influencing the words in Mr Warburton's reference or had influenced Mr Warburton's decision to write a reference. I decided that the failure to declare the loan when writing to the FCA amounted to a further breach of paragraph 14 of the Code.  
    >   
    > However, I decided that the letter of reference submitted by Mr Warburton did not amount to paid advocacy and was not a breach of paragraph 12 of the Code. This is because the letter sent by Mr Warburton did not suggest that the FCA should take any positive action in respect of Mr Joukovski, nor did it make any representations on Mr Joukovski’s behalf. I was therefore satisfied that the letter was not seeking to confer "a financial or material benefit” on Mr Joukovski. I was also mindful that the letter was submitted substantially outside the six-month time limit set by the House's paid advocacy rules.`

- On 17 June 2023, Warburton announced his intention to resign from Parliament, citing his feeling that the parliamentary harassment watchdog denied him a fair hearing over claims he harassed two women. He admitted to taking cocaine after drinking whisky with a third woman.

    >   
    > He said had been left with "no choice" but to provoke "the upheaval of a by-election", adding: "It is my hope that, in so doing, I can freely illuminate the methods of an oversight system not fit for purpose, so that friends and colleagues in the House can see the perverted process by which their own judgement may at any time be freighted."  
    >

- On 11 May 2022, Lee Anderson faced backlash after saying there's not this massive use for food banks in this country during a Commons debate and that people can make a meal for about 30p a day.
    
    > Lee Anderson: `the hon. Member for St Helens North made some great comments about food banks. My invitation is to every Opposition Member: come to Ashfield, work with me for a day in my local food bank and see the brilliant scheme we have in place. When people come for a food parcel now, they have to register for a budgeting course and a cooking course. We show them how to cook cheap and nutritious meals on a budget; we can make a meal for about 30p a day, and this is cooking from scratch.`  
    >   
    > Alex Cunningham: `Can the hon. Gentleman answer a simple question for me: should it be necessary to have food banks in 21st century Britain?`  
    >   
    > Lee Anderson: `I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention, as he makes a great point. Indeed, it is exactly my point, so I invite him personally to come to Ashfield to look at how our food bank works. He will see at first hand that there is not this massive use for food banks in this country. We have generation after generation who cannot cook properly—they cannot cook a meal from scratch—and they cannot budget. The challenge is there. I make that offer to anybody. Opposition Members are sitting there with glazed expressions on their faces, looking at me as though I have landed from a different planet. They should come to Ashfield, next week or the week after, and come to a real food bank that is making a real difference to people’s lives.`

- On 27 March 2022, The Trussell Trust charity said it had distributed over 2.1 million emergency food parcels to people in crisis in the past year, with growing numbers visiting food banks across the country as a result of the cost of living hikes.
    
    > `New figures released today reveal food banks in the Trussell Trust’s network provided more than 2.1 million parcels to people facing financial hardship across the country, from 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2022. This represents a 14% increase compared to the same period in 2019/20 – before the pandemic – as more and more people are unable to afford the absolute essentials that we all need to eat, stay warm, dry and clean. This is the first time food banks in the Trussell Trust’s network have provided more than 2 million parcels, outside of 2020/21, at the height of the pandemic. Alarmingly, more than 830,000 parcels were provided for children, representing a 15% increase from 2019/20 when 720,000 were provided. The Trussell Trust says food banks in its network experienced their busiest winter outside of 2020 at the height of the pandemic, providing 1.2 million parcels in the second half of the year alone (from October to the end of March).` [link](https://www.trusselltrust.org/2022/04/27/food-banks-provide-more-than-2-1-million-food-parcels-to-people-across-the-uk-in-past-year-according-to-new-figures-released-by-the-trussell-trust/)
    
### 2022 Nadine Dorries, Channel 4 Paid Actors Claim
- On 19 May 2022, Nadine Dorries, the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport appeared in front of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee in which she claimed that Channel 4 faked a reality TV show she appeared on in 2010 by hiring actors to play poverty-stricken people on a housing estate.
    
    > `Dr Huq: I might avail myself as well. I remember asking in the Chamber about the same issue and I do not think it is sorted. One of my favourite Channel 4 programmes was "Tower Block of Commons"; I think we have chatted about it before. You were on it as a young MP on the South Acton estate, being sent to see how the other half live.  
    >   
    > Ms Dorries: Then I later discovered that they were actually actors.  
    >   
    > Chair: What, the MPs or the—  
    >   
    > Ms Dorries: No, the people in the estate. It was a Channel 4 production. The parents of some of the boys in that programme contacted me and came here to have lunch to tell me that the boys were in acting school. They were not really living in a flat—they were not real. They were actually actors.  
    >   
    > Dr Huq: That will be a headline tomorrow.  
    >   
    > Ms Dorries: If you remember, there was a pharmacist I went to see who prepared food; she was also a paid actor as well.  
    >   
    > Dr Huq: It was jolly good viewing, and it was on the South Acton estate.`  
    > [link](https://committees.parliament.uk/oralevidence/10242/pdf/)
    
- On 15 July 2022, Channel 4 released a statement in response to the comments Dorries made.
    
    > `At the DCMS Committee meeting on 19 May 2022, Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, Nadine Dorries MP alleged that contributors to the 2010 Channel 4 series Tower Block of Commons, in which she appeared, were paid actors, in acting school and/or not living in the homes in which they were portrayed in the series as living.  
    >   
    > Channel 4 takes any allegations of misrepresentation extremely seriously and always rigorously investigates any such claims.  
    >   
    > In keeping with standard practice Channel 4 asked Love Productions, who produced the programme, to conduct a thorough investigation into the concerns raised. The investigation, overseen by their external lawyers, encompassed contributors who were ordinary members of the public and with whom The Secretary of State had significant interaction. It involved speaking with many of those involved in the making of the series, including contributors and crew, and retrieving and reviewing relevant documentation and footage, including 85 hours of raw footage filmed for the series.  
    >   
    > Channel 4 then reviewed Love Productions’ findings and undertook its own internal document searches and review.  
    >   
    > Neither Love Productions' investigation nor Channel 4’s internal inquiries revealed any evidence to support the allegations made about the programme.`  
    > [link](https://www.channel4.com/press/news/channel-4s-statement-tower-block-commons)
    
- On 20 October 2022, the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee released a report on the comments made by Dorries and found them to not be credible.
    
    > `We are disappointed with Ms Dorries reluctance to engage with the Committee on this matter. Ms Dorries at first refused to reconsider her claims and her subsequent clarifications introduce more confusion than they resolve.  
    >   
    > In the Committee she talks about meeting boys in a flat (which matches Channel 4's investigation) who later turned out to be actors. Her clarification talks about a homeless young men section.  
    >   
    > In the Committee she said that she saw a pharmacist who prepared food and who was also an actor. In her clarification, that pharmacist was the mother of one of the boys.  
    >   
    > In the Committee she said that the parents of one of the boys contacted her and came to have lunch to tell her the boys were in acting school. In her clarification, the mother, who was also the pharmacist, arranged for her son to come to the House for a tour and lunch and it was he who told her about being an actor.  
    >   
    > We do not find either the original claims, or the clarifications to be credible and have seen no corroboration of her claims that Channel 4 and Love Productions used actors in a reality television show. In contrast, the detailed investigation carried out by Channel 4 gives us confidence that her claims are groundless. We are concerned Ms Dorries appears to have taken an opportunity, under the protection of privilege, to traduce the reputation of Channel 4.`

### 2022 John Penrose, Anti-Corruption Tsar’s Resignation
- On 6 June 2022, Johnson's anti-corruption tsar John Penrose resigns and calls for PM to quit due to the Boris Johnson [[United Kingdom Contents Page]] scandal
    
    > John Penroses Letter: `My reason for stepping down is your public letter last week, replying to your Independent Adviser on the Ministerial Code about the recent Sue Gray Report into ‘partygate’. In it you addressed the concerns over the Fixed Penalty Notice you paid, but not the broader and very serious criticisms of what the Report called ‘failures of leadership and judgment’ and its’ conclusion that ‘senior leadership at the centre, both political and official, must bear responsibility for this culture’. You will know (and your letter to your Adviser on the Ministerial Code explicitly says) that the Nolan Principles of Public Life are absolutely central to the Ministerial Code, and that the seventh of them is ‘Leadership’. So the only fair conclusion to draw from the Sue Gray Report is that you have breached a fundamental principle of the Ministerial Code — a clear resigning matter. But your letter to your Independent Adviser on the Ministerial Code ignores this absolutely central, non-negotiable issue completely. And, if it had addressed it, it is hard to see how it could have reached any other conclusion than that you had broken the code.` [link](https://twitter.com/JohnPenroseNews/status/1533753928483061760/photo/1)
    
### 2022 Conservative Party Vote of Confidence Against Johnson
- On 6 June 2022, A vote of confidence was held amongst Conservative Party MPs on the prime minister, Boris Johnson's, leadership of their party. Johnson won the vote with the support of 211 Conservative members of Parliament, 59% of the total. Out of 359 MPs, 148 or 41% voted against him.

### 2022 Lord Geidt, Johnson’s 2nd Ethics Adviser’s Resignation
- On 15 June 2022, Lord Geidt Resigned his position of Independent Adviser on Ministers' Interests. In his resignation letter, Geidt states:
    
    > `I was asked at length about my recent Annual Report. I alluded to my frustration, as made clear in my Preface, that you had not made any public reference to your own conduct under the Ministerial Code in the period since inquiries were underway. This would be especially important in the event that the Metropolitan Police found against you, which they did, and/or that Sue Gray’s report included criticism of behaviour within the scope of the Ministerial Code, which it did.  
    >   
    > Your letter in response to my Annual Report was welcome. It addressed the absence of comment by you about your obligations under that Ministerial Code up until that point. You explained that, by paying a Fixed Term Penalty, you had not breached the Ministerial Code. The letter did not, however, address specifically the criticism in Sue Gray’s report about your adherence to the Nolan Principles (on leadership, in particular). Neither did the letter make mention that, despite being repeatedly questioned in the House of Commons about your obligations under the Ministerial Code (after paying a Fixed Penalty Notice), your responses again made no reference to it.  
    >   
    > I reported to the Select Committee yesterday that I was satisfied that you had responded to my Annual Report to explain your position. I am disappointed, however, that the account you gave was not fuller, as noted above. Moreover, I regret the reference to ‘miscommunication’ between our offices, with the implication that I was somehow responsible for you not being fully aware of my concerns. These inconsistencies and deficiencies notwithstanding, I believed that it was possible to continue credibly as Independent Adviser, albeit by a very small margin.  
    >   
    > This week, however, I was tasked to offer a view about the Government’s intention to consider measures which risk a deliberate and purposeful breach of the Ministerial Code. This request has placed me in an impossible and odious position. My informal response on Monday was that you and any other Minister should justify openly your position vis-a-vis the Code in such circumstances. However, the idea that a Prime Minister might to any degree be in the business of deliberately breaching his own Code is an affront. A deliberate breach, or even an intention to do so, would be to suspend the provisions of the Code to suit a political end. This would make a mockery not only of respect for the Code but licence the suspension of its provisions in governing the conduct of Her Majesty’s Ministers. I can have no part in this.  
    >   
    > Because of my obligation as a witness in Parliament, this is the first opportunity I have had to act on the Government’s intentions. I therefore resign from this appointment with immediate effect.`  
    > [link](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/22061443/lord-geidt-to-pm.pdf)
    
- On 20 June 2022, Culture Minister Nadine Dorries said that Voters don't give a fig about Lord Geidt resigning and replacing him.
    
    > `Asked who should fill Lord Geidt's role, Ms Dorries said: "You call him Lord Geidt. I think the rest of the country had never even heard of him before and called him Lord Geddit."  
    >   
    > "I don’t think they give a fig who replaces him or who he was or what he did. It’s a bit of a bizarre one isn’t it? Someone who wasn’t elected who has resigned."  
    >   
    > "Everybody thought for 24 hours that he was going to resign over something that was going to compromise the Prime Minister, was suddenly blindsided by the fact that it was something to do with steel tariffs."  
    >   
    > "Lord Geddit, Lord Geidt, sorry, he complained so often about the amount of work that he had to do that I don’t think that one person can probably do the job."  
    >   
    > Ms Dorries personal attacks on the peer appear to run counter to the official Downing Street narrative that Lord Geidt fulfilled a "vitally important" position in advising the government on Ministerial Ethics.`

### 2020-23 Chris Pincher Scandal Leading to Johnson’s PM Resignation
### 2020-22 Chris Pincher Scandal
- On 30 June 2022, Pincher resigned as a Government Deputy Chief Whip, after he admitted being very drunk the night before at the private Carlton Club, a private members' club, in St James's, London and having "embarrassed myself and other people". [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-62014765)
- Before appointing him as the chief whip, `The prime minister is said to have referred to the MP as “handsy” and joked about him being “Pincher by name, pincher by nature” as early as 2020.` [[chrispinchergrop]]
- On 3 July 2022, Chris Pincher admission about the incident after reflection.
    
    > "As I told the prime minister, I drank far too much on Wednesday night, embarrassing myself and others, and I am truly sorry for the upset I caused. "The stresses of the last few days, coming on top of those over the last several months, have made me accept that I will benefit from professional medical support. "I am in the process of seeking that now, and I hope to be able to return to my constituency duties as soon as possible." [link](https://www.notion.sobbc.co.uk/news/uk-62023278)
    
- On 3 July 2022, Six new claims of inappropriate behaviour emerge stretching over several years.
    
    > `In fresh allegations this weekend, the Sunday Times reported Mr Pincher had placed his hand on the inner leg of a male Tory MP in a bar in Parliament in 2017. The newspaper reported Mr Pincher also made unwanted advances towards a different male Tory MP in 2018 while in his parliamentary office, and towards a Tory activist in Tamworth around July 2019.` [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-62025612)
    
- On 3 July 2022, Johnson was apparently unaware of such allegations about Pincher.
    
    > `Ms Coffey told the BBC that "to the best of my knowledge" Mr Johnson was not aware of specific allegations about Mr Pincher, saying she had not spoken to the prime minister directly and had received the assurance from the No 10 press office.` [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-62029881)
    
### 2022 Johnson’s Misleading Comments
- On 5 July 2022, it was confirmed that Johnson’s claim that he was not aware of prior specific allegations against Chris Pincher is false as A former top civil servant, Simon McDonald, wrote a formal letter to allege that Downing Street’s version of events was untrue.
    
    > `Five days after Mr Pincher’s resignation as deputy chief whip, there remains significant confusion surrounding complaints about his behaviour prior to the drunkenness he admits at the Carlton Club on 29 June.  
    >   
    > Inaccurate claims by 10 Downing Street continue to be repeated in the media. On 3 July, the BBC website reported: “No official complaints against [Mr Pincher] were ever made.”  
    >   
    > This is not true. In the summer of 2019, shortly after he was appointed minister of state at the Foreign Office, a group of officials complained to me about Mr Pincher’s behaviour. I discussed the matter with the relevant official at the Cabinet Office. (In substance, the allegations were similar to those made about his behaviour at the Carlton Club.) An investigation upheld the complaint; Mr Pincher apologised and promised not to repeat the inappropriate behaviour. There was no repetition at the FCO before he left seven months later.  
    >   
    > The same BBC website report continued: “Downing Street has said Boris Johnson was not aware of any specific allegations when he appointed Mr Pincher deputy chief whip in February.” By 4 July, the BBC website reflected a change in No 10's line: “The prime minister's official spokesman said Mr Johnson knew of ‘allegations that were either resolved or did not progress to a formal complaint’, adding that ‘it was deemed not appropriate to stop an appointment simply because of  
    > unsubstantiated allegations’.”  
    >   
    > The original No 10 line is not true and the modification is still not accurate. Mr Johnson was briefed in person about the initiation and outcome of the investigation. There was a “formal complaint”. Allegations were “resolved” only in the sense that the investigation was completed; Mr Pincher was not exonerated. To characterise the allegations as “unsubstantiated” is therefore wrong.  
    >   
    > I am aware that is unusual to write to you and simultaneously publicise the letter. I am conscious of the duty owed to the target of an investigation but I act out of of my duty towards the victims. Mr Pincher deceived me and others in 2019. He cannot be allowed to use the confidentiality of the process three years ago to pursue his predatory behaviour in other contexts.`  
    > [link](https://twitter.com/SimonMcDonaldUK/status/1544206976820854784/photo/1)
    
- On 5 July 2022, Johnson then apologised later after the letter was published.
    
    > `Boris Johnson has apologised for appointing Chris Pincher as deputy chief whip, saying it "was a mistake" and "in hindsight the wrong thing to do". The prime minister said sorry to "everybody who has been badly affected", adding, "I just want to make absolutely clear that there is no place in this government for anybody who is a predator or who abuses their position of power". He also said: "If I had my time again, I would think back on it and recognise that he wasn't going to learn any lessons and he wasn't going to change and I regret that."` [link](https://news.sky.com/story/boris-johnson-apologises-for-appointing-chris-pincher-as-deputy-chief-whip-and-said-it-was-the-wrong-thing-to-do-12646408)
    
### 2022 Ministerial Resignation Letters
### 5 July
- Rishi Sunak resigned as chancellor. Rishi Sunak’s Letter:
    
    > `That is why I have always tried to compromise in order to deliver the things you want to achieve. On those occasions where I disagreed with you privately, I have supported you publicly.  
    >   
    > That is the nature of the collective government upon which our system relies and it is particularly important that the Prime Minister and Chancellor remain united in hard times such as those we are experiencing today.  
    >   
    > Our country is facing immense challenges. We both want a low-tax, high-growth economy, and world class public services, but this can only be responsibly delivered if we are prepared to work hard, make sacrifices and take difficult decisions.  
    >   
    > I firmly believe the public are ready to hear that truth. Our people know that if something is too good to be true then it’s not true. They need to know that whilst there is a path to a better future, it is not an easy one.  
    >   
    > In preparation for our proposed joint speech on the economy next week, it has become clear to me that our approaches are fundamentally too different.  
    >   
    > I am sad to be leaving Government but I have reluctantly come to the conclusion that we cannot continue like this.`

- Sajid Javid also resigned as Health Secretary. Sajid Javid’s Letter:
    
    > `Conservatives at their best are seen as hard-headed decision-makers, guided by strong values. We may not have always been popular, but we have been competent in acting in the national interest.  
    >   
    > Sadly, in the current circumstances, the public are concluding that we are now neither. The vote of confidence last month showed that a large number of our colleagues agree. It was a moment for humility, grip and new direction.  
    >   
    > I regret to say, however, that it is clear to me that this situation will not change under your leadership – and you have therefore lost my confidence too.`  
    >   
    > ...  
    >   
    > `These are commendable legacies in unprecedented times. But the country needs a strong and principled Conservative Party, and the Party is bigger than any one individual.  
    >   
    > I served you loyally and as a friend, but we all serve the country first. When made to choose between those loyalties there can only be one answer.`

    > `I just don’t think the prime minister any longer has, not just my support, but he doesn’t have, I don’t think, the support of the party, or indeed the country any more`  
    >   
    > ...  
    >   
    > `I think you have to resign because I can’t serve under the prime minister – but I say that with regret because I think this government has done some great things.`

- Alex Chalk also resigned as Solicitor General. Alex Chalk’s Letter:
    
    > `With great sadness I am resigning as Solicitor General.  
    >   
    > To be in government is to accept the duty to argue for difficult or even unpopular policy positions where that serves the broader national interest. But it cannot extend to defending the indefensible.  
    >   
    > The cumulative effect of the Owen Paterson debacle, Partygate and now the handling of the former Deputy Chief Whip’s resignation, is that public confidence in the ability of Number 10 to uphold the standards of candour expected of a British Government has irretrievably broken down. I regret that I share that judgement. This comes at a moment of intense challenge for our country, when trust in government can rarely have been more important. I’m afraid the time has therefore come for fresh leadership.`

- Robin Walker also resigned as Minister of State for School Standards. Robin Walker’s Letter:
    
    > `Unfortunately, recent events have made it clear to me that our great party, for which I have campaigned all of my adult life, has become distracted from its core missions by a relentless focus on questions over leadership. The loss of the Rishi Sunak and the Sajid Javid this week, two of our brightest talents from the top team, reflects a worrying narrowing of the broad church that I believe any Conservative Government should seek to achieve.  
    >   
    > I know that you have been an instinctive One Nation Conservative and I have been proud to support you on delivering Brexit with a deal, on supporting our precious union and on the monumental effort to support the lives and livelihoods of so many through the pandemic. Sadly, in recent months those great achievements of your Government have become overshadowed by mistakes and questions about integrity.`

    > `Values such as integrity, decency, respect and professionalism should matter to us all.

I have given you the benefit of the doubt at each turn, out of loyalty to you as Prime Minister and to our great Party.  
    >   
    > The events of this week, however, have made these contortions impossible. The casual mistreatment of Minister Will Quince and the revelations contained in Lord McDonald's letter highlight just how far your government has fallen from these ideals. I can no longer pirouette around our fractured values. We can and must be better than this.`

- Stuart Andrew also resigned Ministry of Housing. Stuart Andrew’s Letter:
    
    > `Loyalty and unity are traits that I have always endeavoured to provide for our great party. However, I fear I have let these override my judgement recently. There comes a time when you have to look at your own personal integrity and that time is now. Therefore, given recent events I have no other choice than to resign.  
    >   
    > Our party, particularly our members and more importantly our great country, deserve better. Having a marginal seat I have seen the huge sacrifice our members make in volunteering considerable hours to campaign on our behalf and I cannot, in all good conscience, tolerate them having to defend the indefensible.`

Because of the serious erosion in these, I have come to the conclusion that the right thing for our country and for our party is for you to stand down as party leader and Prime Minister. I had hoped you would take this course sooner, of your own volition.

This is seriously damaging public trust and respect for government, democracy and the law, and this great Party’s long tradition as the party of standards, character, conduct, integrity and duty to office and country before partisan self-interest.`

I have backed you throughout these challenges.  
    >   
    > We both know I was particularly upset at the behaviour of the Number Ten team during the Covid restrictions. I backed you in January 2022 because I wanted to see a real change in approach in Number Ten. I have given you ample opportunity to show real change.

    > I am heartbroken that he hasn’t listened and that he is now undermining the incredible achievements of this Government at this late hour.

- On 6 July 2022, The Independent reports that Zahawi had been the subject of an investigation by the NCA, the SFO and HMRC.
    
    > `New chancellor Nadhim Zahawi’s finances were secretly investigated by the National Crime Agency (NCA), The Independent can disclose. A senior serving Whitehall figure has revealed that a number of individuals were formally approached by officials from the NCA about the matter in 2020. The NCA said they were seeking information about multimillionaire Mr Zahawi’s finances, stated the source. The inquiry was codenamed “Operation Catalufa” and is understood to have involved the agency’s International Corruption Unit.` [[chancellornadh]]
    
- On 6 July 2022, The Guardian reports that the Cabinet Office had raised a “red flag” about Zahawi’s tax affairs before his appointment as Chancellor.
    
    > `A “flag” was raised by officials over the financial affairs of the new chancellor, Nadhim Zahawi, before he was promoted, the Observer can reveal. Civil servants in the Cabinet Office’s propriety and ethics team are said to have alerted Boris Johnson to a HM Revenue and Customs “flag” over Zahawi before his appointment. The PM appointed him despite the possible concerns over his tax affairs. “It’s extraordinary that flags were raised ahead of Nadhim’s appointment by the Downing Street proprietary team,” one source said this weekend. “These sorts of concerns would stop someone receiving an MBE or OBE. The idea he could be chancellor or even prime minister is unbelievable”. The revelation comes after a report last week in the Independent that Zahawi was investigated by the National Crime Agency (NCA). The investigation did not lead to any action and there is no suggestion of wrongdoing.` [link](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/09/revealed-officials-raised-flag-over-nadim-zahawis-tax-affairs-before-he-was-appointed-chancellor)
    
- On 10 July 2022, Dan Neidle, Founder of Tax Policy Associates published the estimated calculated tax Zahawi avoided, mostly a gain on YouGov shares which would have been subject to Capital Gains Tax had Zahawi held them, but is tax free in Gibraltar.
    
    > `If Zahawi had held the shares directly, he would have paid about £3.7m of capital gains tax when they were sold in 2017. The trust likely paid no tax. So – unless there is an innocent explanation I am missing – £3.7m of tax was avoided.  
    >   
    > The trust may also avoid UK inheritance tax on assets that ultimately will go to Zahawi’s children. If its assets were just the £24m, that would be almost £10m of inheritance tax avoided. Are there other assets in there? Are the trust assets fully subject to inheritance tax? Again, only Zahawi can clarify this.`

    > `Nadhim Zahawi has said he is "clearly being smeared" after questions were reportedly raised about his personal finances before his appointment as chancellor.

I was being told that the Serious Fraud Office, that the National Crime Agency, that HMRC are looking into me," he said. "I was not aware of this, I have always paid my taxes, I have declared my taxes in the UK." Referring to a possible investigation, Mr Zahawi added: "I will answer any questions that HMRC has of me. "But I will go further: I am going to make a commitment today that if I am prime minister I am going to publish my accounts annually."` [link](https://news.sky.com/story/conservative-leadership-hopeful-nadhim-zahawi-says-he-is-clearly-being-smeared-over-tax-allegations-12649436)
    
- On 13 July 2022, Dan Neidle, Founder of Tax Policy Associates published the reasons as to why Zahawi’s claims don’t line up with the publicly available findings and challenges Zahawi to correct him if he’s gotten it wrong.
    
    > `Zahawi is saying that Balshore got a 45% stake in YouGov because it provided capital to YouGov. There is zero evidence of any capital from Balshore (except, just about possibly, a £91k loan – but that wouldn’t justify a 45% stake). I see only three possibilities:  
    >   
    > 1. I am missing something. What?  
    > 2. Balshore did provide capital, but this was omitted from all of YouGov’s accounts and filings, and not even picked up during the IPO (when financial statements are carefully checked).  
    > 3. Zahawi is lying, and this was tax avoidance.  
    >   
    > I don’t accuse someone of lying frivolously. But Zahawi is making a definitive claim and, right now, there is just no evidence for it. If the answer is indeed that I’ve made a mistake, or the YouGov and Balshore filings are all mistakes, Zahawi should prove it by pointing us towards some actual evidence. Not just making assertions in background briefings to journalists.`

- On 16 July 2022, The Times reported that YouGov themselves denied Zahawi's story, confirming Dan Neidle’s claims.
    
    > `Nadhim Zahawi has been accused of giving a misleading explanation of his tax affairs amid allegations that he may have avoided millions in tax by using an offshore family trust. Before moving into politics, the chancellor made his name in business as one of two co-founders of YouGov, the polling company set up in 2000.` [link](https://archive.ph/AZULP)
    
    > `He said Zahawi’s father had provided £7,000 in start-up capital to YouGov as well as financial support to his son, who had given up his job for the business.  
    >   
    > This explanation now appears to have been undermined YouGov’s company secretary, Tilly Heald, who said that Hareth Zahawi had not advised the business and was merely a shareholder. “To YouGov’s knowledge, YouGov had/has no association with Hareth Zahawi beyond any interests he may have held/holds in Balshore Investments Ltd in its capacity as a YouGov shareholder,” Heald said.  
    >   
    > Employees who worked at YouGov in its early years had no recollection of Zahawi’s father being in the office and were surprised to hear of his alleged involvement with the business.  
    >   
    > According to experts, Zahawi may have avoided tax if he deliberately manoeuvred shares into his father’s offshore company with the intention that he or his family would subsequently benefit through gifts and loans.`

The MPs also quizzed him about Mr Zahawi's tax arrangements. He said he would not comment on specific individuals, but added: "There are no penalties for innocent errors in your tax affairs. So if you take reasonable care, but nevertheless make a mistake, whilst you will be liable for the tax and for interest if it's paid late, you would not be liable for a penalty. "But if your error was as a result of carelessness, then legislation says that a penalty could apply in those circumstances."` [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-64410490)

She recorded her conversation with the then Foreign Secretary, telling him she was “really shaken and upset” about what had happened and that she regretted their relationship had become sexual.

She also copied in someone she thought was Hayes’s wife but was actually an assistant to Andrew Percy, the MP for Brigg and Goole. After taking advice from colleagues, Percy spoke to the chief whip, Wendy Morton, who referred the issue to Case.  
    >   
    > Braverman was later to argue that the document was simply a written ministerial statement, that she had had a blazing row with Truss about immigration numbers (implying that was the real reason for her dismissal) and that she had sent it by mistake at 4am. It was, in fact, sent three or four hours later that morning.`

The review also identified that within the period between 6th September and 19th October, I had sent official documents from my Government email to my personal email address on six occasions (see Appendix). The review confirmed that all of these occasions occurred in circumstances when I was conducting Home Office meetings virtually or related to public lines to take in interviews. Some of these meetings had been hastily arranged in response to urgent operational matters relating to Home Office priorities. The review also confirmed that on no other occasions had my Special Adviser emailed my personal account in relation to official business.  
    >   
    > ...  
    >   
    > I have been transparent about my mistakes relating to the Ministerial Code. As referenced above, at the heart of the Code lies the principle of responsibility on Ministers, ‘for deciding how to act and conduct themselves in light of the Code and for justifying their actions and conduct to Parliament and the public’ (paragraph 1.6). Of course, the Prime Minister is the ultimate judge of standards and the appropriate consequences of a breach of the standards. There is a range of sanctions including a public apology or remedial action.  
    >   
    > Although the level of risk here was low, the document did not relate to national security or law enforcement matters and the breach was swiftly and proactively reported to officials, I nevertheless decided to take full responsibility by tendering my resignation.

    > I am sorry for the errors of judgement set out above and I reiterated my apology to Mr Percy MP yesterday. I hold myself as Home Secretary to the highest possible standards and I am glad to be able to serve again.

I reiterate the importance, for a proper understanding of the subject-matter, of reading the report as a whole. As set out in paragraphs 53 and 57 above, for the purpose of this investigation under the Ministerial Code, conduct would fall within the description of ‘bullying’ if it can be characterised as:

    > (2) In relation to the FCDO Complaint:  
    > (a) The DPM made a legitimate management choice, on the basis of his genuine, adverse view about the work of others (albeit without any grounds for disciplinary action).  
    >   
    > None of the constituent elements of this accepted characterisation of bullying is a legally defined term. All of the words used are capable of a range of interpretations. Where relevant, I have explained the sense in which I have used any of these words.  
    >   
    > (b) In reaching and implementing this management choice he acted in a way which was intimidating, in the sense of unreasonably and persistently aggressive conduct in the context of a work meeting. It also involved an abuse or misuse of power in a way that undermines or humiliates. He introduced an unwarranted punitive element. His conduct was experienced as undermining or humiliating by the affected individual, which was inevitable. It is to be inferred that the DPM was aware that this would be the effect of his conduct; at the very least, he should have been aware.  
    >   
    > (c) On a separate occasion, the DPM referred to the Civil Service Code in a way which could reasonably have been understood as suggesting that those involved had acted in breach. This had a significant adverse effect on a particular individual who took it seriously. The DPM’s conduct was a form of intimidating behaviour, in the sense of conveying a threat of unspecified disciplinary action, and was experienced as such. He did not target any individual, nor intend to threaten anyone with disciplinary action. However, he ought to have realised that his reference to the Civil Service Code could well have been understood as a threat.  
    >   
    > (3) In relation to the MoJ Complaints:  
    >   
    > (a) The significance of the MoJ Group Complaint is that it paved the way for all of the other Complaints. The participants in the MoJ Group Complaint deserve credit for their courage in coming forward. But its composition and content make it unsuitable as a basis for any findings about the DPM’s conduct.  
    >   
    > (b) On a number of occasions at meetings with policy officials, the DPM acted in a manner which was intimidating, in the sense of going further than was necessary or appropriate in delivering critical feedback, and also insulting, in the sense of making unconstructive critical comments about the quality of work done (whether or not as a matter of substance any criticism was justified). By way of example, he complained about the absence of what he referred to as ‘basic information’ or ‘the basics’, about ‘obstructiveness’ on the part of officials whom he perceived to be resistant to his policies, and described some work as ‘utterly useless’ and ‘woeful’.  
    >   
    > (c) The DPM did not intend by the conduct described to upset or humiliate. Nor did he target anyone for a specific type of treatment.  
    >   
    > (d) His interruptive style is not itself behaviour that could be regarded as intimidating or insulting. However, individuals who had previously experienced the DPM express an unconstructive criticism of their work (and understood it as a criticism of them personally) might reasonably have interpreted a series of interruptions as a form of implicit criticism. The combination of unconstructive critical feedback and regular interruption is likely to be experienced as intimidating, in the sense of being unreasonably difficult to deal with, and plainly was so experienced by some individuals.  
    >   
    > (e) The DPM was not aware, nor could he reasonably have been aware, of the impact on individuals in terms of what are said to have been the effects of his behaviour on their health.  
    >   
    > (f) Adopting the language of Dame Sue Owen’s report (while acknowledging that it is not part of the definition accepted in the FDA Case and that both types of conduct may amount to bullying), the DPM’s conduct during the MoJ Period was sometimes ‘abrasive’, in the sense of a personal style which is or feels intimidating or insulting to the individual, but is not intended to be so. His conduct was not, however, ‘abusive’, in the sense of behaviour which is intended and specifically targeted.  
    >   
    > (g) The DPM has been able to regulate this level of ‘abrasiveness’ since the announcement of the investigation. He should have altered his approach earlier.  
    >   
    > (h) Since the investigation was announced, there has not been any valid ground for criticism of the DPM’s conduct.

- On 21 April 2023, Raab resigns as Deputy Prime Minister, Justice Secretary and Lord Chancellor.
    
    > Raab’s Resignation Letter:  
    >   
    > `Dear Prime Minister,  
    >   
    > I am writing to resign from your government, following receipt of the report arising from the inquiry conducted by Adam Tolley KC. I called for the inquiry and undertook to resign, if it made any finding of bullying whatsoever. I believe it is important to keep my word.  
    >   
    > It has been a privilege to serve you as deputy prime minister, justice secretary and lord chancellor. I am grateful to have had the opportunity to work as a minister in a range of roles and departments since 2015, and pay tribute to the many outstanding civil servants with whom I have worked.  
    >   
    > Whilst I feel duty bound to accept the outcome of the inquiry, it dismissed all but two of the claims levelled against me. I also believe that its two adverse findings are flawed and set a dangerous precedent for the conduct of good government. First, ministers must be able to exercise direct oversight with respect to senior officials over critical negotiations conducted on behalf of the British people, otherwise the democratic and constitutional principle of ministerial responsibility will be lost. This was particularly true during my time as foreign secretary, in the context of the Brexit negotiations over Gibraltar, when a senior diplomat breached the mandate agreed by cabinet.  
    >   
    > Second, ministers must be able to give direct critical feedback on briefings and submissions to senior officials, in order to set the standards and drive the reform the public expect of us. Of course, this must be done within reasonable bounds. Mr Tolley concluded that I had not once, in four and a half years, sworn or shouted at anyone, let alone thrown anything or otherwise physically intimidated anyone, nor intentionally sought to belittle anyone. I am genuinely sorry for any unintended stress or offence that any officials felt, as a result of the pace, standards and challenge that I brought to the Ministry of Justice. That is, however, what the public expect of ministers working on their behalf.  
    >   
    > In setting the threshold for bullying so low, this inquiry has set a dangerous precedent. It will encourage spurious complaints against ministers, and have a chilling effect on those driving change on behalf of your government - and ultimately the British people.  
    >   
    > Finally, I raised with you a number of improprieties that came to light during the course of this inquiry. They include the systematic leaking of skewed and fabricated claims to the media in breach of the rules of the inquiry and the Civil Service Code of Conduct, and the coercive removal by a senior official of dedicated private secretaries from my Ministry of Justice private office, in October of last year. I hope these will be independently reviewed.  
    >   
    > I remain as supportive of you and this government, as when I first introduced you at your campaign leadership launch last July. You have proved a great prime minister in very challenging times, and you can count on my support from the backbenches.`  
    > [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-65333734)
    
    > Sunaks’ Response:  
    >   
    > `Dear Dominic,  
    >   
    > Thank you for your letter notifying me of your decision to resign from your position in His Majesty's government as deputy prime minister and lord chancellor and secretary of state for justice. It is with great sadness that I have accepted your resignation.  
    >   
    > When I became prime minister in October last year, I pledged that the government I lead would have integrity, professionalism and accountability at every level. The Ministerial Code requires ministers to uphold the highest standards.  
    >   
    > When formal complaints about your conduct in different ministerial posts were submitted last year, I appointed at your request an independent investigator to conduct a full investigation into the specific facts surrounding these complaints. Adam Tolley KC has now submitted his report and I have carefully considered its findings, as well as consulting the independent adviser on minsters' interests.  
    >   
    > As you say, you had - rightly - undertaken to resign if the report made any finding of bullying whatsoever. You have kept your word. But it is clear that there have been shortcomings in the historic process that have negatively affected everyone involved. We should learn from this how to better handle such matters in future.`

### 2022-23 Andrew Bridgen, Suspended For COVID Misinformation, Joins Reclaim Party
- On 13 December 2022, In the Commons, Andrew Bridgen stated his opinion on the negative effect of mRNA Vaccines on the population citing common conspiracy theories and accusing the British Heart Foundation of covering up said negative effects from the public using NDAs.
    
    > `It has also been brought to my attention by a whistleblower from a very reliable source that one of these institutions is covering up clear data that reveals that the mRNA vaccine increases inflammation of the heart arteries. It is covering this up for fear that it may lose funding from the pharmaceutical industry. The lead of that cardiology research department has a prominent leadership role with the British Heart Foundation, and I am disappointed to say that he has sent out non-disclosure agreements to his research team to ensure that this important data never sees the light of day. That is an absolute disgrace. Systemic failure in an over-medicated population also contributes to huge waste of British taxpayers’ money and increasing strain on the NHS.` [link](https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2022-12-13/debates/EAB2E8A2-A721-47DD-A79C-4EFD10F10C2D/VaccinesPotentialHarms?highlight=brought%20attention%20whistleblower%20from%20very%20reliable%20source%20that%20one%20these%20institutions%20covering%20up%20clear%20data%20that%20reveals%20that%20mrna%20vaccine%20increases%20inflammation%20heart%20arteries\#contribution-1DD3E094-94E8-4AD4-A355-8D664AC095F6)
    
- On 28 December 2022, The British Heart Foundation categorically denied any claims of attempting to cover up the potential harms of mRNA COVID Vaccines.
    
    > `Bridgen’s claims that the British Heart Foundation was involved in a conspiracy to cover up the potential harms of taking the Covid vaccine were dismissed by the charity. A spokesperson told The Times: “The scientific consensus is that the benefits of Covid-19 vaccination, including a reduced risk of severe illness or death, far outweigh the very small risk of rare side effects like myocarditis or pericarditis for the vast majority of people, especially as people get older. “Scientific evidence shows that Covid-19 itself is much more likely to cause myocarditis than the vaccine is, and people who are vaccinated have a much lower risk of getting other serious complications caused by Covid-19.` [link](https://www.thenational.scot/news/23216791.tory-mps-british-heart-foundation-covid-conspiracy-claims-dismissed/)

- On 11 January 2023, Bridgen was then suspended from the Conservative Party for the tweet.
    
    > `Andrew Bridgen has been suspended as a Conservative MP for spreading misinformation about Covid vaccination. It comes after the North West Leicestershire MP posted a tweet that compared vaccines to the Holocaust. Tory chief whip Simon Hart said the comments had "crossed a line" and caused great offence. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak also condemned the remarks, calling the comparison "utterly unacceptable". Mr Hart said Mr Bridgen would lose the party whip - meaning he will sit as an independent - while a formal investigation takes place.

    > `On March 12, 2023, British MP Andrew Bridgen posted a series of tweets concerning COVID-19 and vaccines. Bridgen, who has served as MP for North West Leicestershire since 2010, told his followers, "I can confirm that during my visit to Washington DC last Christmas/ New Year I was informed that the U.S. DoD were responsible for both the virus and the vaccines. Fort Detrick was named. Also a facility in Canada."  
    >   
    > Bridgen followed this statement with a second tweet outlining his belief that those involved in this alleged plot are likely to be apprehended in the near future. It reads, "by the end of the month, I expect to see the start of criminal proceedings against the many politicians and officials who are responsible around the world."  
    >   
    > A few hours after posting his initial tweets, Bridgen followed up on his claims with a screenshot from the Wikipedia page concerning Fort Detrick. The section shown reads, "In August 2019, its deadly germ research operations were shut down following serious safety violations, in particular relating to the disposal of dangerous materials."`

    > `Mr Speaker, today I will make an order under section 35 of the Scotland Act 1998 preventing the Gender Recognition Reform (Scotland) Bill from proceeding to Royal Assent. This Order will mean the Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament will not submit the Bill for Royal Assent. This Government believes however that transgender people deserve our respect, our support and our understanding.

### 2023 Richard Sharp, Chairman of the BBC Appointment By Johnson, Leading to Chairman Resignation
- On 22 January 2023, Labour began calling for an investigation into a loan and then-appointment to the Chairman of the BBC around Richard Sharp.
    
    > `Labour is calling for a parliamentary investigation into claims the chairman of the BBC helped Boris Johnson secure a loan guarantee, weeks before the then-PM recommended him for the role. The Sunday Times says Richard Sharp was involved in arranging a guarantor on a loan of up to £800,000 for Mr Johnson. Mr Sharp said he had "simply connected" people and there was no conflict of interest. Mr Johnson's spokesman said he did not receive financial advice from Mr Sharp. He also dismissed Labour's suggestion Mr Johnson could have breached the code of conduct for MPs "through failing to appropriately declare the arrangement" on his Parliamentary register of interests.` [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-64362640)
    
- On 23 January 2023, An investigation was announced by the watchdog in which oversees the public appointments process.
    
    > `The process of hiring BBC chairman Richard Sharp is to be reviewed by the watchdog that oversees how public appointments are made. It follows claims that shortly before being given the job, Mr Sharp helped the then-prime minister, Boris Johnson, secure a loan guarantee agreement. William Shawcross, the Commissioner for Public Appointments, said the review would ensure the hiring followed rules. Mr Sharp said he "simply connected" people and did not arrange financing.` [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-64377685)

    >   
    > The Cabinet Office document was drawn up after Johnson and Sharp sought advice in early December on accepting a loan of up to £800,000 guaranteed by the prime minister’s distant cousin, Sam Blyth, a Canadian businessman. Blyth and Sharp had discussed how to help Johnson with his finances on two occasions, the first, at a dinner in September and the second, on the telephone. Johnson secured the loan in February 2021, according to his own declaration in the internal register of ministers’ interests, parts of which are not made public.`

    > `Mr Sharp recognised the need to be open and transparent over facilitating an introduction of the then Prime Minister to Mr Blyth regarding the £800,000 loan guarantee and brought this to the attention of the Cabinet Secretary. However, he failed to apply the same standards of openness and candour in his decision not to divulge this information during the interview process or to this committee during the pre-appointment hearing.  
    >   
    > The public appointments process can only work effectively if all those involved are open and transparent. Richard Sharp chose to tell the then Prime Minister both of his application to Chair the BBC and of his involvement in the arrangement of a loan for the Mr Johnson but decided not to tell either the appointment panel or this Committee about his actions. The Prime Minister, the panel and this Committee are all integral to the appointment process for the Chair of the BBC, but only Mr Johnson was fully aware of Mr Sharp’s potential conflict at the time the appointment was made. The Government, and all those involved in the public appointments process must ensure that the future public appointments process is not clouded by partial disclosure.`

She candidly and transparently drew attention to the fact that she served as Chair of her local Conservative Association from March 2016 to July 2020. She provided evidence that the

It would therefore appear that there was no "significant political activity" which might have caused concern and no reason to doubt that Ms Baxendale (or Ms Cluff) were appropriately appointed to this Panel.  
    >   
    > Whilst the "independent" element of this Panel was substantially provided by the SIPM, it is recommended that Appointing Authorities (see paragraph 5, Annex A), especially in relation to high profile appointments, ought to have a process to allow Ministers to conclude "whether there are relationships or circumstances which are likely to affect, or could appear to affect the Panellist's judgement" as well as checks on "significant political activity" as above.

    > Bravermans Letter: ‘I accept that I was speeding and regret doing so. At no point did I try to avoid sanction. My actions were always directed toward finding an appropriate way to participate in the speed awareness course, taking into account my new role as Home Secretary and the necessary security and privacy issues that this raised. My interactions with officials intended to provide appropriate clarification of the options available to me in my role as Home Secretary. Whenever I was informed that a possible option was not available, I accepted that. At no point did I instruct officials to behave contrary to the advice that was provided.’ [link](https://news.sky.com/story/bravermans-letter-to-pm-and-sunaks-response-in-full-12888249)
