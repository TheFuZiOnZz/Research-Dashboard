### 2022-23 Zahawi, Undeclared Tax Affairs Investigation Leading To Removal Of Chairman Position
- On 5 July 2022, Nadhim Zahawi becomes Chancellor of the Exchequer under Boris Johnson. [link](https://news.sky.com/story/nadhim-zahawi-made-chancellor-after-rishi-sunak-resigns-as-steve-barclay-replaces-sajid-javid-as-health-secretary-12646552)
- On 6 July 2022, The Independent reports that Zahawi had been the subject of an investigation by the NCA, the SFO and HMRC.
    
    > `New chancellor Nadhim Zahawi’s finances were secretly investigated by the National Crime Agency (NCA), The Independent can disclose. A senior serving Whitehall figure has revealed that a number of individuals were formally approached by officials from the NCA about the matter in 2020. The NCA said they were seeking information about multimillionaire Mr Zahawi’s finances, stated the source. The inquiry was codenamed “Operation Catalufa” and is understood to have involved the agency’s International Corruption Unit.` [[chancellornadh]]
    
- On 6 July 2022, The Guardian reports that the Cabinet Office had raised a “red flag” about Zahawi’s tax affairs before his appointment as Chancellor.
    
    > `A “flag” was raised by officials over the financial affairs of the new chancellor, Nadhim Zahawi, before he was promoted, the Observer can reveal. Civil servants in the Cabinet Office’s propriety and ethics team are said to have alerted Boris Johnson to a HM Revenue and Customs “flag” over Zahawi before his appointment. The PM appointed him despite the possible concerns over his tax affairs. “It’s extraordinary that flags were raised ahead of Nadhim’s appointment by the Downing Street proprietary team,” one source said this weekend. “These sorts of concerns would stop someone receiving an MBE or OBE. The idea he could be chancellor or even prime minister is unbelievable”. The revelation comes after a report last week in the Independent that Zahawi was investigated by the National Crime Agency (NCA). The investigation did not lead to any action and there is no suggestion of wrongdoing.` [link](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/09/revealed-officials-raised-flag-over-nadim-zahawis-tax-affairs-before-he-was-appointed-chancellor)
    
- On 10 July 2022, Dan Neidle, Founder of Tax Policy Associates published the estimated calculated tax Zahawi avoided, mostly a gain on YouGov shares which would have been subject to Capital Gains Tax had Zahawi held them, but is tax free in Gibraltar.
    
    > `If Zahawi had held the shares directly, he would have paid about £3.7m of capital gains tax when they were sold in 2017. The trust likely paid no tax. So – unless there is an innocent explanation I am missing – £3.7m of tax was avoided.  
    >   
    > The trust may also avoid UK inheritance tax on assets that ultimately will go to Zahawi’s children. If its assets were just the £24m, that would be almost £10m of inheritance tax avoided. Are there other assets in there? Are the trust assets fully subject to inheritance tax? Again, only Zahawi can clarify this.`  
    > [link](https://www.taxpolicy.org.uk/2022/07/10/zahawi/)
    
- On 11 July 2022, Zahawi claims he was unaware of the allegations regarding his taxes and said he was being smeared.
    
    > `Nadhim Zahawi has said he is "clearly being smeared" after questions were reportedly raised about his personal finances before his appointment as chancellor. The former education secretary and vaccines minister, who is vying to take over from Boris Johnson, told Sky News he had "always" paid his taxes and had "declared" them in the UK. Should he become prime minister he will publish his accounts annually, he pledged.` [link](https://news.sky.com/story/conservative-leadership-hopeful-nadhim-zahawi-says-he-is-clearly-being-smeared-over-tax-allegations-12649436)
    
    > `Speaking to Sky News presenter Kay Burley, Mr Zahawi said he had been unaware of the allegations. "So I was clearly being smeared. I was being told that the Serious Fraud Office, that the National Crime Agency, that HMRC are looking into me," he said. "I was not aware of this, I have always paid my taxes, I have declared my taxes in the UK." Referring to a possible investigation, Mr Zahawi added: "I will answer any questions that HMRC has of me. "But I will go further: I am going to make a commitment today that if I am prime minister I am going to publish my accounts annually."` [link](https://news.sky.com/story/conservative-leadership-hopeful-nadhim-zahawi-says-he-is-clearly-being-smeared-over-tax-allegations-12649436)
    
- On 13 July 2022, Dan Neidle, Founder of Tax Policy Associates published the reasons as to why Zahawi’s claims don’t line up with the publicly available findings and challenges Zahawi to correct him if he’s gotten it wrong.
    
    > `Zahawi is saying that Balshore got a 45% stake in YouGov because it provided capital to YouGov. There is zero evidence of any capital from Balshore (except, just about possibly, a £91k loan – but that wouldn’t justify a 45% stake). I see only three possibilities:  
    >   
    > 1. I am missing something. What?  
    > 2. Balshore did provide capital, but this was omitted from all of YouGov’s accounts and filings, and not even picked up during the IPO (when financial statements are carefully checked).  
    > 3. Zahawi is lying, and this was tax avoidance.  
    >   
    > I don’t accuse someone of lying frivolously. But Zahawi is making a definitive claim and, right now, there is just no evidence for it. If the answer is indeed that I’ve made a mistake, or the YouGov and Balshore filings are all mistakes, Zahawi should prove it by pointing us towards some actual evidence. Not just making assertions in background briefings to journalists.`  
    > [link](https://www.taxpolicy.org.uk/2022/07/13/zahawi-capital/)
    
- On 16 July 2022, The Times reported that YouGov themselves denied Zahawi's story, confirming Dan Neidle’s claims.
    
    > `Nadhim Zahawi has been accused of giving a misleading explanation of his tax affairs amid allegations that he may have avoided millions in tax by using an offshore family trust. Before moving into politics, the chancellor made his name in business as one of two co-founders of YouGov, the polling company set up in 2000.` [link](https://archive.ph/AZULP)
    
    > `He said Zahawi’s father had provided £7,000 in start-up capital to YouGov as well as financial support to his son, who had given up his job for the business.  
    >   
    > This explanation now appears to have been undermined YouGov’s company secretary, Tilly Heald, who said that Hareth Zahawi had not advised the business and was merely a shareholder. “To YouGov’s knowledge, YouGov had/has no association with Hareth Zahawi beyond any interests he may have held/holds in Balshore Investments Ltd in its capacity as a YouGov shareholder,” Heald said.  
    >   
    > Employees who worked at YouGov in its early years had no recollection of Zahawi’s father being in the office and were surprised to hear of his alleged involvement with the business.  
    >   
    > According to experts, Zahawi may have avoided tax if he deliberately manoeuvred shares into his father’s offshore company with the intention that he or his family would subsequently benefit through gifts and loans.`

- On 18 January 2023, the story resurfaces with confirmation that Zahawi agreed to pay the owed amount.
    
    > `FORMER Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi has agreed to pay several million in tax after scrutiny of his family’s financial affairs. Sources said his representatives will stump up the seven-figure sum to settle a dispute with HMRC.` [link](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21046397/chancellor-nadhim-zahawi-tax/)
    
- On 18 January 2023, Sunak is asked by a Labour MP whether he was aware of Zahawi’s tax investigation when he was appointed.
    
    > Alex Sobel: `This month, the right hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Nadhim Zahawi) was forced to pay millions to His Majesty’s Revenue and Customs to settle a tax dispute. Was the Prime Minister aware of the investigation when he appointed the right hon. Gentleman to his Cabinet and as chairman of the Conservative party? Will the Prime Minister demand accountability from his Cabinet members over their tax affairs?`  
    >   
    > Rishi Sunak: `My right hon. Friend has already addressed the matter in full and there is nothing more that I can add.`

- On 21 January 2023, Zahawi said his tax error was found to be `careless and not deliberate`
    
    > `Nadhim Zahawi says his tax error was found to be "careless and not deliberate" after Labour called for him to be sacked over his finances. The Tory chairman and cabinet member released a statement saying he wanted to "address some of the confusion" about his finances. He said his father took founder shares in YouGov and that HMRC later "disagreed about the exact allocation", leading him to "settle the matter and pay what they said was due". "They concluded that this was a 'careless and not deliberate' error," he said. "So that I could focus on my life as a public servant, I chose to settle the matter and pay what they said was due, which was the right thing to do." 'I asked my father to help'` [link](https://news.sky.com/story/nadhim-zahawi-says-tax-error-was-careless-and-not-deliberate-12791829)
    
- On 23 January 2023, Sunak orders investigation into Nadhim Zahawi tax affairs by his independent ethics adviser.
    
    > `Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has asked his independent ethics adviser to look into the disclosures made about the tax affairs of Nadhim Zahawi. Mr Sunak said there were "questions that need answering" over the case. Tory party chairman Mr Zahawi is facing calls to resign, after it emerged he paid a penalty to HMRC over previously unpaid tax while he was chancellor, as part of a multi-million pound dispute. He said he was "confident" he had "acted properly throughout". On a visit to a hospital in Northamptonshire, Mr Sunak told reporters: "Integrity and accountability is really important to me and clearly in this case there are questions that need answering.` [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-64373509)
    
- On 26 January 2023, the chief executive of HMRC confirmed that no tax penalty is given for misfiling your taxes accidentally.
    
    > `Mr Harra, the chief executive of HMRC, gave evidence to the Commons Public Accounts Committee about managing tax compliance following the pandemic. The MPs also quizzed him about Mr Zahawi's tax arrangements. He said he would not comment on specific individuals, but added: "There are no penalties for innocent errors in your tax affairs. So if you take reasonable care, but nevertheless make a mistake, whilst you will be liable for the tax and for interest if it's paid late, you would not be liable for a penalty. "But if your error was as a result of carelessness, then legislation says that a penalty could apply in those circumstances."` [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-64410490)
    
- On 29 January 2023, Sir Laurie Magnus, Independent Ethics Adviser, in a letter to Rishi Sunak found that the Zahawi’s settlement amounted to a breach of the ministerial code.
    
    > `I consider that Mr Zahawi, in holding the high privilege of being a Minister of the Crown, has shown insufficient regard for the general principles of the Ministerial Code and the requirements in particular, under the Seven Principles of Public Life, to be honest, open and an exemplary leader through his own behaviour.  
    >   
    > I want to commend Mr Zahawi for his willingness to assist with my inquiry. I also fully appreciate the pressures faced by ministers as they address the complex issues of government and the difficulties they encounter in balancing the demands of their personal lives and their ministerial responsibilities.  
    >   
    > These factors, however, cannot mitigate my overall judgement that Mr Zahawi's conduct as a minister has fallen below the high standards that, as Prime Minister, you rightly expect from those who serve in your government.`  
    > [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-64444315)
    
- On 29 January 2023, Rishi Sunak the sent a letter to Nadhim Zahawi sacking him as Chairman of the Conservative Party.
    
    > `When I became Prime Minister last year, I pledged that the Government I lead would have integrity, professionalism and accountability at every level.  
    >   
    > That is why, following new information which came to light in recent days regarding your personal financial arrangements and declarations, I asked Sir Laurie Magnus, the Independent Adviser on Ministers' Interests, to fully investigate this matter. You agreed and undertook to co-operate fully with the inquiry.  
    >   
    > Following the completion of the Independent Adviser's investigation - the findings of which he has shared with us both - it is clear that there has been a serious breach of the Ministerial Code. As a result, I have informed you of my decision to remove you from your position in His Majesty's Government.`  
    > [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-64444315)
    
- On 29 January 2023, Nadhim Zahawi then replied to Rishi Sunak.
    
    > `Thank you for your kind words. It has been, after being blessed with my loving family, the privilege of my life to serve in successive governments and make what I believe to have been a tangible difference to the country I love.  
    >   
    > ...  
    >   
    > I am concerned, however, about the conduct of some of the fourth estate in recent weeks. In a week when a Member of Parliament was physically assaulted, I fail to see how one headline on this issue 'The Noose Tightens' reflects legitimate scrutiny of public officials. I am sorry to my family for the toll this has taken on them.  
    >   
    > You can be assured of my support form the backbenches in the coming years. Your five priorities are the right priorities, and I will do whatever I can to help you deliver them.`

### 2022 Johnson’s City Hall Job Scandal
- On 9 July 2022, it was reported that Johnson allegedly pushed to attain a job for a young woman who claims he abused his power to have a sexual relationship with her.
    
    > `The ousted prime minister allegedly advocated for a role for the woman in 2008, just weeks after they met, while he was serving as Mayor of London. The Sunday Times said the unnamed woman was interviewed for a City Hall job when Mr Johnson was married. The appointment is said to have been blocked because his colleague, Kit Malthouse, now a minister in the outgoing PM's caretaker Cabinet, said the pair appeared to have an inappropriately close relationship. The newspaper reported that the woman was upset by what happened, confronting Mr Johnson about it several years later. She recorded her conversation with the then Foreign Secretary, telling him she was “really shaken and upset” about what had happened and that she regretted their relationship had become sexual. She continued saying his behaviour was an example of how “anyone who steps into this building is fair game” and were there to be “leered at” by powerful men.` [link](https://www.lbc.co.uk/news/boris-johnson-city-hall-job-abuse-of-power-relationship/)
    
### 2022 Johnson’s `Deep State` Comment in Parliament
- On 18 July 2022, during a debate on whether Parliament had confidence in the current government, Johnson insinuated that the Labour Party is in collaboration with the so-called Deep State.
    
    > `Some people will say, as I leave office, that this is the end of Brexit. Listen to the deathly hush on the Opposition Benches! The Leader of the Opposition and the deep state will prevail in their plot to haul us back into alignment with the EU as a prelude to our eventual return.

### 2022 Truss, U-Turn on Civil Service Pay Plan During Leadership Campaign
- On 1 August 2022, as apart of her Leadership Campaign, Liz Truss announced a policy to cut civil service pay.
    
    > `Conservative leadership contender Liz Truss has opened a new front in her fight with the Whitehall “establishment”, vowing to cut civil service pay and holidays and refusing to rule out breaking up the Treasury.  
    >   
    > The foreign secretary has presented herself as a radical insurgent in her fight to become Britain’s next prime minister, portraying her rival, former chancellor Rishi Sunak, as a defender of a failed economic orthodoxy.  
    >   
    > Truss promised far-reaching reforms to the civil service, claiming she could save almost £11bn a year from Britain’s bureaucracy, with proposals such as lower pay for officials who work in poorer parts of the UK.  
    >   
    > The frontrunner in the Conservative leadership race declared a “war on waste in Whitehall”, vowing to cut civil service holidays and axe 326 diversity officers working across government departments.`  
    > [link](https://archive.ph/oXfTh)
    
- On 2 August 2022, Liz Truss then abandoned the policy to cut civil service pay with her campaign team saying the policy had been “wilfully misrepresented”
    
    > `Liz Truss’s Tory leadership campaign suffered a serious setback on Tuesday when she was forced to abandon her plan to cut the pay of public sector workers living in poorer areas of Britain. The proposal drew ferocious cross-party criticism, including from Tories representing constituencies in the north and midlands, forcing the foreign secretary to ditch the policy only 12 hours after it was launched.` ... `Truss’s team insisted that the policy had been “wilfully misrepresented” — even though it had issued a press release explicitly stating that £8.8bn could be saved if the policy applied to all 5.7mn public sector workers.` [link](https://www.ft.com/content/4d9ed0ea-fd2c-4f84-a187-2dacabbd3943)
    
### 2022 Suella Braverman, Personal Email Account Usage
- On 19 October 2022, Braverman resigned as Home Secretary for a self-described mistake that led to a breach in the ministerial code.
    
    > Braverman Letter: `It is with the greatest regret that I am choosing to tender my resignation.  
    >   
    > Earlier today, I sent an official document from my personal email to a trusted parliamentary colleague as part of policy engagement, and with the aim of garnering support for government policy on migration. This constitutes a technical infringement of the rules. As you know, the document "as a draft Written Ministerial Statement about migration. due for publication imminently. Much of it had already been briefed to MPs. Nevertheless it is right for me to go.  
    >   
    > As soon as I realised my mistake, I rapidly reported this on official channels. and informed the Cabinet Secretary. As Home Secretary I hold myself to the highest standards and my resignation is the right thing to do. The business of government relies upon people accepting responsibility for their mistakes. Pretending we haven't made mistakes, carrying on as if everyone can't see that we have made them. and hoping that things will magically come right is not serious politics. I have made a mistake: I accept responsibility: I resign.`

- On 22 October 2022, The Times reported that the story given by Braverman was inaccurate and the incident was more common than she stated.
    
    > `The wheels began to fall off when Simon Case, the cabinet secretary, alerted Truss that Suella Braverman, the home secretary, had committed two breaches of the ministerial code. She had emailed cabinet papers from her ministerial account to her private gmail account and then on to backbench veteran Sir John Hayes, a fellow right-winger. She also copied in someone she thought was Hayes’s wife but was actually an assistant to Andrew Percy, the MP for Brigg and Goole. After taking advice from colleagues, Percy spoke to the chief whip, Wendy Morton, who referred the issue to Case.  
    >   
    > Braverman was later to argue that the document was simply a written ministerial statement, that she had had a blazing row with Truss about immigration numbers (implying that was the real reason for her dismissal) and that she had sent it by mistake at 4am. It was, in fact, sent three or four hours later that morning.`

- On 25 October 2022, after the leadership election of Sunak, Braverman was reappointed as Home Secretary.

    > `Jake Berry, who sat in the cabinet alongside Braverman at the heart of Liz Truss’s government, said she was responsible for a “really serious breach” after sending confidential information to a private address, sending it to an MP, attempting to send it to the MP’s wife and then accidentally sending it to a member of parliamentary staff.

    > “It was sent from a private email address to another member of parliament,” he told TalkTV’s Kate McCann. “She then sought to copy in that individual’s wife and accidentally sent it to a staffer in parliament. To me, that seems a really serious breach, especially when it was documents relating to cyber security, as I believe. That seems a really serious breach.

- On 31 October 2022, Braverman sent a letter the the Chair of the Home Affair Select Committee explaining the issues surrounding the resignation where Braverman mentioned that she had used her email accounts like this at least six times.
    
    > `Following my referral and subsequent resignation, the Home Office conducted a review of my use of personal email and verified the above sequence of events. The review also identified that within the period between 6th September and 19th October, I had sent official documents from my Government email to my personal email address on six occasions (see Appendix). The review confirmed that all of these occasions occurred in circumstances when I was conducting Home Office meetings virtually or related to public lines to take in interviews. Some of these meetings had been hastily arranged in response to urgent operational matters relating to Home Office priorities. The review also confirmed that on no other occasions had my Special Adviser emailed my personal account in relation to official business.  
    >   
    > ...  
    >   
    > I have been transparent about my mistakes relating to the Ministerial Code. As referenced above, at the heart of the Code lies the principle of responsibility on Ministers, ‘for deciding how to act and conduct themselves in light of the Code and for justifying their actions and conduct to Parliament and the public’ (paragraph 1.6). Of course, the Prime Minister is the ultimate judge of standards and the appropriate consequences of a breach of the standards. There is a range of sanctions including a public apology or remedial action.  
    >   
    > Although the level of risk here was low, the document did not relate to national security or law enforcement matters and the breach was swiftly and proactively reported to officials, I nevertheless decided to take full responsibility by tendering my resignation.  
    >   
    > I am sorry for the errors of judgement set out above and I reiterated my apology to Mr Percy MP yesterday. I hold myself as Home Secretary to the highest possible standards and I am glad to be able to serve again. I am grateful to the Prime Minister for his ongoing confidence following my reappointment.`

### 2022 Andrew Bridgen, Lobbying Breaches
- On 3 November 2022, The House of Commons Committee on Standards found that Bridgen repeatedly breached rules on paid lobbying and declaring interests.
    
    > `It is my view that Mr Bridgen has breached the rules on lobbying when he initiated the approaches summarised in paragraph 98. His approaches sought to confer a financial benefit on Mere Plantations, from whom he had received an outside reward in the form of a funded trip and a donation. The approaches listed above were all made within six months following receipt of those rewards.  
    >   
    > It is my view that Mr Bridgen breached the rules on lobbying when he participated in approaches summarised in paragraph 100. His approaches sought to confer a financial benefit on Mere Plantations, from whom he had received an outside award. The permission in the rule is not triggered as the approaches were initiated by Mr Bridgen and sought to confer a benefit exclusively on Mere Plantations. The approaches listed above were all made within the six months following receipt of those outside rewards.`  
    > [link](https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/31469/documents/176530/default/)
    
- On 26 November 2022, Bridgen appealed against the decision made by the Standards Committee.
    
    > `Tory MP Andrew Bridgen is appealing against his recommended suspension after he was found to have displayed a “very cavalier” attitude to the rules in a series of lobbying breaches. The backbencher was referring the Commons’ Standards Committee’s damning decision to Parliament’s Independent Expert Panel despite previously accepting the findings. At the time the punishment was recommended by the cross-party committee earlier this month, the North West Leicestershire MP said he was “extremely disappointed” with the findings but added “I accept them and will comply with them as required to do so”.` [link](https://www.itv.com/news/central/2022-11-26/tory-mp-andrew-bridgen-appeals-against-lobbying-breach-suspension)
    
- On 20 December 2022, Bridgen appeal= against the decision made by the Standards Committee was rejected.
    
    > `Tory MP Andrew Bridgen has failed in his bid to overturn his recommended five-day suspension for a “very cavalier” series of breaches of lobbying rules. The Independent Expert Panel (IEP) dismissed his appeal “on all grounds” and told the backbencher that he could reasonably have been handed a “more severe” punishment. The North West Leicestershire MP initially accepted the Commons Standards Committee’s findings, before calling for a reversal by Parliament’s appeal panel.` [link](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/andrew-bridgen-commons-mps-b2248585.html)
    
- On 9 January 2023, Bridgen was then suspended for five days from the House of Commons for the breaching paid advocacy rules.
    
    > `The Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen has been suspended from the House of Commons for five days after being found to have breached rules on paid lobbying and declaring interests. The MP for north-west Leicestershire was found to have repeatedly broken the MPs’ code of conduct by a cross-party committee, which endorsed findings from Kathryn Stone, the parliamentary commissioner for standards. He was unsuccessful in an attempt to overturn the recommendation in December and a motion was approved by parliament on Monday. The suspension is due to start on Tuesday 10 January, and will run for five sitting days.` [link](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jan/09/andrew-bridgen-suspended-from-house-of-commons-over-lobbying)
    
- On 23 January 2023, Bridgen apologises for breaching MPs' rules
    
    > `North West Leicestershire MP Andrew Bridgen has apologised to Parliament for breaching the MPs' code of conduct. Mr Bridgen was suspended from the House of Commons for five days, after he was found to have shown a "careless and cavalier" attitude to the rules. Addressing MPs following his suspension, he said: "I should have been more alert to the rules." He also apologised for a letter to the standards commissioner, which he said he now realised was "inappropriate".` [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-64379330)
    
### 2022 Truss’ PM Resignation
- On 20 October 2022, as a reaction to the [[United Kingdom Contents Page]] controvesy, Liz Truss resigns as Leader of the Conservative Party and therefore Prime Minister after just 44 days in office.
    
    > Liz Truss’ Speech: `We delivered on energy bills and on cutting national insurance.  
    >   
    > And we set out a vision for a low tax, high growth economy – that would take advantage of the freedoms of Brexit.  
    >   
    > I recognise though, given the situation, I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected by the Conservative Party.  
    >   
    > I have therefore spoken to His Majesty The King to notify him that I am resigning as Leader of the Conservative Party.  
    >   
    > This morning I met the Chair of the 1922 Committee Sir Graham Brady.  
    >   
    > We have agreed there will be a leadership election to be completed in the next week.

    > This will ensure we remain on a path to deliver our fiscal plans and maintain our country’s economic stability and national security.  
    >   
    > I will remain as Prime Minister until a successor has been chosen.`

### 2022 Suella Braverman, Manston Migrant Centre
- On 31 October 2022, it was reported that Braverman didn’t sign off on living accommodation for channel crossing migrants.
    
    > `The source told me that Suella Braverman failed to sign off accommodation and that decision not to take on extra accommodation is going to be potentially very difficult for the home secretary.  
    >   
    > Two Home Office sources told me that the decision is likely to face a judicial review because the law requires that people are held in these conditions for 24 to 48 hours only, when in reality people are being held there for weeks at a time.  
    >   
    > The question for the home secretary will be whether she ignored official advice and did not sign off on accommodation when she should have done.`

    > `The Home Secretary allegedly refused to sign off on hotel bookings for migrants, which would have eased pressure on the Manston processing centre, because “they were in Tory voting areas”.  
    >   
    > A senior government source told LBC Suella Braverman was presented with options for locations to move asylum seekers from the overcrowded site in Kent, where conditions are said to be “wretched”, but wouldn’t approve those in Conservative seats.  
    >   
    > It’s claimed three hotels were approved last week which are in Labour constituencies, although the source would not confirm where these are.

### 2022 Gavin Williamson, Bullying Claims Leading to Cabinet Resignation
- On 4 November 2022, Tortoise Media reported that that in October 2022, Wendy Morton had made a formal complaint to the Conservative Party about text messages that Gavin Williamson had sent her on 13 September, during her tenure as Chief Whip under the Liz Truss cabinet.

    > ...  
    >   
    > Wendy Morton, the former chief whip under Liz Truss, has passed on details of “vile and threatening messages” she received in the days before the former prime minister resigned, sources say. One MP said the submission included screen grabs of messages sent by Williamson, himself a former chief whip. He said there was “quite a bit of evidence”, and that a number of MPs were willing to back Morton up. Another suggested there was a misogynistic undertone to the content, with messages sent over the course of several weeks.`

    > Sir Gavin, who was brought back into cabinet by the Prime Minister in last week’s reshuffle, has denied the claims.  
    >   
    > Labour said the “revelations raise fresh questions about Rishi Sunak’s woeful judgment.”

- On 7 November 2022, Sunak refused to sack Williamson over abusive texts to Morton.
    
    > `Rishi Sunak has “full confidence” in the Cabinet Office minister Gavin Williamson despite the emergence of bullying claims and abusive text messages he sent to the former Conservative chief whip Wendy Morton.  
    >   
    > The texts were revealed over the weekend to include angry remonstrations about not being invited to the Queen’s funeral and one that said “there is a price for everything”.  
    >   
    > On Monday the prime minister’s spokesperson said Sunak had a zero-tolerance approach to bullying, but had refused to sack Williamson, claiming he had an “important contribution to make to government”. No 10 has been unable to spell out Williamson’s current responsibilities as a Cabinet Office minister.  
    >   
    > Asked if the prime minister had full confidence in Williamson, the spokesperson said: “Yes.” Pressed on why Sunak gave Williamson a job, he added: “Obviously he thinks he has an important contribution to make to government.”  
    >   
    > Sunak is facing mounting criticism over his decision to bring Williamson back into the cabinet with knowledge of Morton’s claims.`

    >

- On 20 April 2023, Sunak receives the report into Raab’s conduct.
    
    > `As I said at the outset, this report is the product of my investigation into the facts surrounding the Complaints. It states, to the extent consistent with upholding the principle of confidentiality, my findings of fact. I reiterate the importance, for a proper understanding of the subject-matter, of reading the report as a whole. As set out in paragraphs 53 and 57 above, for the purpose of this investigation under the Ministerial Code, conduct would fall within the description of ‘bullying’ if it can be characterised as:  
    > (1) Offensive, intimidating, malicious or insulting behaviour; or  
    > (2) Abuse or misuse of power in ways that undermine, humiliate, denigrate or injure the recipient  
    >   
    > In summary, I have found as follows:  
    >   
    > (1) In relation to the DExEU Complaint:  
    > (a) The DPM’s conduct cannot be characterised as offensive, malicious or insulting. It was experienced as intimidating, in the sense of excessively demanding. I could not make a finding as to whether it was in fact intimidating in this sense. There was no evidence to suggest any abuse or misuse of power.  
    > (b) The DPM did not intend any adverse effect on others.  
    > (c) No-one drew to the DPM’s attention that his conduct was in any way problematic.  
    > (d) He did not know and could not reasonably have been aware of what is said to have been the impact of his conduct on certain individuals.  
    > (2) In relation to the FCDO Complaint:  
    > (a) The DPM made a legitimate management choice, on the basis of his genuine, adverse view about the work of others (albeit without any grounds for disciplinary action).  
    >   
    > None of the constituent elements of this accepted characterisation of bullying is a legally defined term. All of the words used are capable of a range of interpretations. Where relevant, I have explained the sense in which I have used any of these words.  
    >   
    > (b) In reaching and implementing this management choice he acted in a way which was intimidating, in the sense of unreasonably and persistently aggressive conduct in the context of a work meeting. It also involved an abuse or misuse of power in a way that undermines or humiliates. He introduced an unwarranted punitive element. His conduct was experienced as undermining or humiliating by the affected individual, which was inevitable. It is to be inferred that the DPM was aware that this would be the effect of his conduct; at the very least, he should have been aware.  
    >   
    > (c) On a separate occasion, the DPM referred to the Civil Service Code in a way which could reasonably have been understood as suggesting that those involved had acted in breach. This had a significant adverse effect on a particular individual who took it seriously. The DPM’s conduct was a form of intimidating behaviour, in the sense of conveying a threat of unspecified disciplinary action, and was experienced as such. He did not target any individual, nor intend to threaten anyone with disciplinary action. However, he ought to have realised that his reference to the Civil Service Code could well have been understood as a threat.  
    >   
    > (3) In relation to the MoJ Complaints:  
    >   
    > (a) The significance of the MoJ Group Complaint is that it paved the way for all of the other Complaints. The participants in the MoJ Group Complaint deserve credit for their courage in coming forward. But its composition and content make it unsuitable as a basis for any findings about the DPM’s conduct.  
    >   
    > (b) On a number of occasions at meetings with policy officials, the DPM acted in a manner which was intimidating, in the sense of going further than was necessary or appropriate in delivering critical feedback, and also insulting, in the sense of making unconstructive critical comments about the quality of work done (whether or not as a matter of substance any criticism was justified). By way of example, he complained about the absence of what he referred to as ‘basic information’ or ‘the basics’, about ‘obstructiveness’ on the part of officials whom he perceived to be resistant to his policies, and described some work as ‘utterly useless’ and ‘woeful’.  
    >   
    > (c) The DPM did not intend by the conduct described to upset or humiliate. Nor did he target anyone for a specific type of treatment.  
    >   
    > (d) His interruptive style is not itself behaviour that could be regarded as intimidating or insulting. However, individuals who had previously experienced the DPM express an unconstructive criticism of their work (and understood it as a criticism of them personally) might reasonably have interpreted a series of interruptions as a form of implicit criticism. The combination of unconstructive critical feedback and regular interruption is likely to be experienced as intimidating, in the sense of being unreasonably difficult to deal with, and plainly was so experienced by some individuals.  
    >   
    > (e) The DPM was not aware, nor could he reasonably have been aware, of the impact on individuals in terms of what are said to have been the effects of his behaviour on their health.  
    >   
    > (f) Adopting the language of Dame Sue Owen’s report (while acknowledging that it is not part of the definition accepted in the FDA Case and that both types of conduct may amount to bullying), the DPM’s conduct during the MoJ Period was sometimes ‘abrasive’, in the sense of a personal style which is or feels intimidating or insulting to the individual, but is not intended to be so. His conduct was not, however, ‘abusive’, in the sense of behaviour which is intended and specifically targeted.  
    >   
    > (g) The DPM has been able to regulate this level of ‘abrasiveness’ since the announcement of the investigation. He should have altered his approach earlier.  
    >   
    > (h) Since the investigation was announced, there has not been any valid ground for criticism of the DPM’s conduct.  
    >   
    > In view of the findings of fact, and in light of the Terms of Reference, questions in relation to the Ministerial Code are a matter for the Prime Minister.`

- On 21 April 2023, Raab resigns as Deputy Prime Minister, Justice Secretary and Lord Chancellor.
    
    > Raab’s Resignation Letter:  
    >   
    > `Dear Prime Minister,  
    >   
    > I am writing to resign from your government, following receipt of the report arising from the inquiry conducted by Adam Tolley KC. I called for the inquiry and undertook to resign, if it made any finding of bullying whatsoever. I believe it is important to keep my word.  
    >   
    > It has been a privilege to serve you as deputy prime minister, justice secretary and lord chancellor. I am grateful to have had the opportunity to work as a minister in a range of roles and departments since 2015, and pay tribute to the many outstanding civil servants with whom I have worked.  
    >   
    > Whilst I feel duty bound to accept the outcome of the inquiry, it dismissed all but two of the claims levelled against me. I also believe that its two adverse findings are flawed and set a dangerous precedent for the conduct of good government. First, ministers must be able to exercise direct oversight with respect to senior officials over critical negotiations conducted on behalf of the British people, otherwise the democratic and constitutional principle of ministerial responsibility will be lost. This was particularly true during my time as foreign secretary, in the context of the Brexit negotiations over Gibraltar, when a senior diplomat breached the mandate agreed by cabinet.  
    >   
    > Second, ministers must be able to give direct critical feedback on briefings and submissions to senior officials, in order to set the standards and drive the reform the public expect of us. Of course, this must be done within reasonable bounds. Mr Tolley concluded that I had not once, in four and a half years, sworn or shouted at anyone, let alone thrown anything or otherwise physically intimidated anyone, nor intentionally sought to belittle anyone. I am genuinely sorry for any unintended stress or offence that any officials felt, as a result of the pace, standards and challenge that I brought to the Ministry of Justice. That is, however, what the public expect of ministers working on their behalf.  
    >   
    > In setting the threshold for bullying so low, this inquiry has set a dangerous precedent. It will encourage spurious complaints against ministers, and have a chilling effect on those driving change on behalf of your government - and ultimately the British people.  
    >   
    > Finally, I raised with you a number of improprieties that came to light during the course of this inquiry. They include the systematic leaking of skewed and fabricated claims to the media in breach of the rules of the inquiry and the Civil Service Code of Conduct, and the coercive removal by a senior official of dedicated private secretaries from my Ministry of Justice private office, in October of last year. I hope these will be independently reviewed.  
    >   
    > I remain as supportive of you and this government, as when I first introduced you at your campaign leadership launch last July. You have proved a great prime minister in very challenging times, and you can count on my support from the backbenches.`  
    > [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-65333734)
    
    > Sunaks’ Response:  
    >   
    > `Dear Dominic,  
    >   
    > Thank you for your letter notifying me of your decision to resign from your position in His Majesty's government as deputy prime minister and lord chancellor and secretary of state for justice. It is with great sadness that I have accepted your resignation.  
    >   
    > When I became prime minister in October last year, I pledged that the government I lead would have integrity, professionalism and accountability at every level. The Ministerial Code requires ministers to uphold the highest standards.  
    >   
    > When formal complaints about your conduct in different ministerial posts were submitted last year, I appointed at your request an independent investigator to conduct a full investigation into the specific facts surrounding these complaints. Adam Tolley KC has now submitted his report and I have carefully considered its findings, as well as consulting the independent adviser on minsters' interests.  
    >   
    > As you say, you had - rightly - undertaken to resign if the report made any finding of bullying whatsoever. You have kept your word. But it is clear that there have been shortcomings in the historic process that have negatively affected everyone involved. We should learn from this how to better handle such matters in future.`

### 2022-23 Andrew Bridgen, Suspended For COVID Misinformation, Joins Reclaim Party
- On 13 December 2022, In the Commons, Andrew Bridgen stated his opinion on the negative effect of mRNA Vaccines on the population citing common conspiracy theories and accusing the British Heart Foundation of covering up said negative effects from the public using NDAs.
    
    > `It has also been brought to my attention by a whistleblower from a very reliable source that one of these institutions is covering up clear data that reveals that the mRNA vaccine increases inflammation of the heart arteries. It is covering this up for fear that it may lose funding from the pharmaceutical industry. The lead of that cardiology research department has a prominent leadership role with the British Heart Foundation, and I am disappointed to say that he has sent out non-disclosure agreements to his research team to ensure that this important data never sees the light of day. That is an absolute disgrace. Systemic failure in an over-medicated population also contributes to huge waste of British taxpayers’ money and increasing strain on the NHS.` [link](https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2022-12-13/debates/EAB2E8A2-A721-47DD-A79C-4EFD10F10C2D/VaccinesPotentialHarms?highlight=brought%20attention%20whistleblower%20from%20very%20reliable%20source%20that%20one%20these%20institutions%20covering%20up%20clear%20data%20that%20reveals%20that%20mrna%20vaccine%20increases%20inflammation%20heart%20arteries\#contribution-1DD3E094-94E8-4AD4-A355-8D664AC095F6)
    
- On 28 December 2022, The British Heart Foundation categorically denied any claims of attempting to cover up the potential harms of mRNA COVID Vaccines.
    
    > `Bridgen’s claims that the British Heart Foundation was involved in a conspiracy to cover up the potential harms of taking the Covid vaccine were dismissed by the charity. A spokesperson told The Times: “The scientific consensus is that the benefits of Covid-19 vaccination, including a reduced risk of severe illness or death, far outweigh the very small risk of rare side effects like myocarditis or pericarditis for the vast majority of people, especially as people get older. “Scientific evidence shows that Covid-19 itself is much more likely to cause myocarditis than the vaccine is, and people who are vaccinated have a much lower risk of getting other serious complications caused by Covid-19.` [link](https://www.thenational.scot/news/23216791.tory-mps-british-heart-foundation-covid-conspiracy-claims-dismissed/)

The Prime Minister, the panel and this Committee are all integral to the appointment process for the Chair of the BBC, but only Mr Johnson was fully aware of Mr Sharp’s potential conflict at the time the appointment was made. The Government, and all those involved in the public appointments process must ensure that the future public appointments process is not clouded by partial disclosure.`

She candidly and transparently drew attention to the fact that she served as Chair of her local Conservative Association from March 2016 to July 2020. She provided evidence that the
