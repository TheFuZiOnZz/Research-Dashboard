### 2020-21 Priti Patel, Bullying Report Leading To Alex Allan, Johnson’s 1st Ethics Adviser’s Resignation
- On 20 February 2020, Patel came under scrutiny for trying to "force out" Sir Philip Rutnam, the most senior civil servant in her department.
    
    > `Priti Patel has attempted to oust her most senior civil servant after a toxic clash at the top of the Home Office. Multiple sources inside the department have accused the home secretary of bullying, belittling officials in meetings, making unreasonable demands and creating an “atmosphere of fear”. Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, has been dragged into the row after Ms Patel demanded the removal of her permanent secretary, Sir Philip Rutnam. Sir Philip is understood to have raised concerns about Ms Patel’s behaviour within the Cabinet Office. A senior Whitehall source said that the situation had become “completely unsustainable and was going to blow up”. [link](https://archive.ph/mped2)
    
- On 29 February 2020, Sir Philip Rutnam resigned saying he would sue the government for constructive dismissal and that he did not believe Patel's assertion that she had been uninvolved in an alleged campaign briefing against him.

Sir Philip Rutnam said there had been a "vicious and orchestrated" campaign against him in Home Secretary Priti Patel's office.` [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51687287)
    
- On 20 November 2020, a Cabinet Office inquiry by Sir Alex Allan found evidence that Patel had breached the ministerial code following allegations of bullying in the three government departments in which she had served.
    
    > `My advice is that the Home Secretary has not consistently met the high standards required by the Ministerial Code of treating her civil servants with consideration and respect. Her approach on occasions has amounted to behaviour that can be described as bullying in terms of the impact felt by individuals. To that extent her behaviour has been in breach of the Ministerial Code, even if unintentionally. This conclusion needs to be seen in context. There is no evidence that she was aware of the impact of her behaviour, and no feedback was given to her at the time. The high pressure and demands of the role, in the Home Office, coupled with the need for more supportive leadership from top of the department has clearly been a contributory factor. In particular, I note the finding of different and more positive behaviour since these issues were raised with her.` [link](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/937010/Findings_of_the_Independent_Adviser.pdf)

- On 20 November 2020, Sir Alex Allan then announced that he had resigned as the Prime Minister's chief advisor on the ministerial code after Johnson rejected the findings of the inquiry and stated that he had "full confidence" in Patel.
    
    > `I recognise that it is for the Prime Minister to make a judgement on whether actions by a Minister amount to a breach of the Ministerial Code. But I feel that it is right that I should now resign from my position as the Prime Minister’s independent adviser on the Code.` [link](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/statement-from-sir-alex-allan)
    
- On 20 November 2020, Patel said that she had never set out to upset anyone and that she was absolutely sorry for anyone that I have upset.
    
    > `I work with thousands of brilliant civil servants every single day and we work together day in day out to deliver on the agenda of this Government and I'm absolutely sorry for anyone that I have upset` [link](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/11/20/boris-johnson-news-priti-patel-defence-lockdown-brexit-election/)
    
- In March 2021, the British Government and Rutnam reached a settlement. Rutnam received payment of £340,000 with a further £30,000 in costs. This arrangement meant that Patel would no longer be called to give evidence before a public tribunal which was due to be held in September 2021.
