- On February to March 1998,
- On 28 February 1998 to 11 June 1999, Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority had been pushing for independence from Serbia since 1989, when Mr. Milosevic, the then President of Serbia, stripped the province of its broad autonomy, saying he needed to protect its Serb minority.
### 1998 UNSC Resolution 1160
- On 31 March 1998, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1160.
    - `1. Calls upon the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia immediately to take the further necessary steps to achieve a political solution to the issue of Kosovo through dialogue and to implement the actions indicated in the Contact Group statements of 9 and 25 March 1998;  
          
        2. Calls also upon the Kosovar Albanian leadership to condemn all terrorist action, and emphasizes that all elements in the Kosovar Albanian community should pursue their goals by peaceful means only;  
          
        3. Underlines that the way to defeat violence and terrorism in Kosovo is for the authorities in Belgrade to offer the Kosovar Albanian community a genuine political process;  
          
        4. Calls upon the authorities in Belgrade and the leadership of the Kosovar Albanian community urgently to enter without preconditions into a meaningful dialogue on political status issues, and notes the readiness of the Contact Group to facilitate such a dialogue;  
          
        5. Agrees, without prejudging the outcome of that dialogue, with the proposal in the Contact Group statements of 9 and 25 March 1998 that the principles for a solution of the Kosovo problem should be based on the territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and should be in accordance with OSCE standards, including those set out in the Helsinki Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe of 1975, and the Charter of the United Nations, and that such a solution must also take into account the rights of the Kosovar Albanians and all who live in Kosovo, and expresses its support for an enhanced status for Kosovo which would include a substantially greater degree of autonomy and meaningful self-administration;`

- On 15 May 1998, U.S. diplomacy meeting (Milosevic-Rugova meeting) in Belgrave, EU ditches proposal to stop new investment in Serbia, In the same week: Belgrade launches a major offensive along the border with Albania (against international law)
    - `Pressed by the Americans, Mr. Milosevic met Mr. Rugova on May 15 with the United States Ambassador to Macedonia, Christopher Hill. In return for Mr. Milosevic's compliance, Washington pressed the Europeans to suspend the introduction of tough economic sanctions against Mr. Milosevic, including a ban on foreign investment in Serbia.` [[clintonmeets]]
    - `The government offensive, which continued unabated despite the deployment of KDOM, was an apparent attempt to crush civilian support for the rebels. Government forces attacked civilians, systematically destroyed towns, and forced thousands of people to flee their homes. The police were repeatedly seen looting homes, destroying already abandoned villages, burning crops, and killing farm animals, as well as committing summary executions, all violations of the rules of war. The majority of those killed and injured were civilians. At least 250,000 people were displaced between May and September 1998, according to UNHCR, many of them women and children. The border region with Albania was particularly hard hit, but so were other areas of KLA activity, such as Drenica and the area around Orahovac.` [[link]](https://www.refworld.org/pdfid/3c2b204a0.pdf)

        authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Kosovo Albanian leadership and reduce the risks of a humanitarian catastrophe;  
          
        2. Demands also that the authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Kosovo Albanian leadership take immediate steps to improve the humanitarian situation and to avert the impending humanitarian catastrophe;  
          
        3. Calls upon the authorities in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Kosovo Albanian leadership to enter immediately into a meaningful dialogue without preconditions and with international involvement, and to a clear timetable, leading to an end of the crisis and to a negotiated political solution to the issue of Kosovo, and welcomes the current efforts aimed at facilitating such a dialogue;`

### 1999 Rambouillet Agreement
- [[link]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rambouillet_Agreement)
- The Rambouillet Agreement, formally the Interim Agreement for Peace and Self-Government in Kosovo, was a proposed peace agreement between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and a delegation representing the ethnic Albanian majority population of Kosovo.
- On 18 March 1999, the Albanian, American and British delegation signed the Rambouillet Accords while the Serbian and Russian delegations refused.
    - `1. All citizens in Kosovo shall enjoy, without discrimination, the equal rights and freedoms set forth in this Agreement.  
        2. National communities and their members shall have additional rights specified in Chapter 1. Kosovo, Federal, and Republic authorities shall not interfere with the exercise of these additional rights. The national communities shall be legally equal as specified herein, and shall not use their additional rights to endanger the rights of other national communities or the rights of citizens, the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, or the functioning of representative democratic government in Kosovo.  
        3. All authorities in Kosovo shall fully respect human rights, democracy, and the equality of citizens and national communities.  
        4. Citizens in Kosovo shall have the right to democratic self-government through legislative, executive, judicial, and other institutions established in accordance with this Agreement. They shall have the opportunity to be represented in all institutions in Kosovo. The right to democratic self-government shall include the right to participate in free and fair elections.  
        5. Every person in Kosovo may have access to international institutions for the protection of their rights in accordance with the procedures of such institutions.  
        6. The Parties accept that they will act only within their powers and responsibilities in Kosovo as specified by this Agreement. Acts outside those powers and responsibilities shall be null and void. Kosovo shall have all rights and powers set forth herein, including in particular as specified in the Constitution at Chapter 1. This Agreement shall prevail over any other legal provisions of the Parties and shall be directly applicable. The Parties shall harmonize their governing practices and documents with this Agreement.  
        7. The Parties agree to cooperate fully with all international organizations working in Kosovo on the implementation of this Agreement.`  
        [[link]](https://1997-2001.state.gov/regions/eur/)
- `According to the FCO, the Rambouillet negotiations "would define the terms of an agreement which would provide for a cease-fire, a peace settlement and the deployment of an international peacekeeping force within Kosovo to uphold that settlement." As we discussed above, both parties attended Rambouillet under NATO's threat of "whatever measures were necessary to avert a humanitarian catastrophe." The threat was nominally addressed to both sides. In practice, given the international sympathy for the Kosovo Albanian population, who were suffering greater atrocities than the Serb population (and KLA attacks were mostly focussed on Serb policemen, while Serb action often focussed on unarmed civilians) the Rambouillet package was always likely, overall, to be more favourable to the Albanians than the Serbs. The Serbs could be threatened, while on the whole, the Kosovo Albanians could only be bribed.` [[link]](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199900/cmselect/cmfaff/28/2809.htm\#n112)
### 1999 UNSC Resolution 1244

        - Comprehensive approach to the economic development and stabilization of the crisis region.  
          
        Annex 2

        5. Establishment of an interim administration for Kosovo as a part of the international civil presence under which the people of Kosovo can enjoy substantial autonomy within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, to be decided by the Security Council of the United Nations. The interim administration to provide transitional administration while establishing and overseeing the development of provisional democratic self-governing institutions to ensure conditions for a peaceful and normal life for all inhabitants in Kosovo.  
        6. After withdrawal, an agreed number of Yugoslav and Serbian personnel will be permitted to return to perform the following functions:

Negotiations between the parties for a settlement should not delay or disrupt the establishment of democratic self-governing institutions.  
        9. A comprehensive approach to the economic development and stabilization of the crisis region. This will include the implementation of a stability pact for South-Eastern Europe with broad international participation in order to further promotion of democracy, economic prosperity, stability and regional cooperation.  
        10. Suspension of military activity will require acceptance of the principles set forth above in addition to agreement to other, previously identified, required elements, which are specified in the footnote below. A military-technical agreement will then be rapidly concluded that would, among other things, specify additional modalities, including the roles and functions of Yugoslav/Serb personnel in Kosovo:  
          
        Withdrawal  
          
        - Procedures for withdrawals, including the phased, detailed schedule and delineation of a buffer area in Serbia beyond which forces will be withdrawn;

        - Suspension of military activity will occur after the beginning of verifiable withdrawals;  
        - The discussion and achievement of a military-technical agreement shall not extend the previously determined time for completion of withdrawals.`
