### 1915-18 Sinai and Palestine Campaign
- On 28 January 1915 - 30 October 1918, The Sinai and Palestine campaign was part of the Middle Eastern theatre of World War I. The British Empire, the French Third Republic, and the Kingdom of Italy fought alongside the [[Israel-Palestine Contents Page]] in opposition to the Ottoman Empire, the German Empire, and the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
### 1915 Raid on the Suez Canal
- On 28 January 1915 - 4 February 1915, The Raid on the Suez Canal, took place when a German-led Ottoman Army force advanced from Southern Palestine to attack the British Empire-protected Suez Canal, marking the beginning of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of World War 1.
- On 28 January 1915, Turkish forces were spotted not far from the stationed British forces along the Suez Canal.
    
    > `On 28 January, British aircraft located a Turkish force of up to 4,000 men some eight miles east of Deversoir (in the central sector), which confirmed the British view that the main Turkish attack would fall in the centre, probably in the area between Serapeum (four miles south of Lake Timsah) and El Ferdan (seven miles north of Ismailia). This warning gave the British time to reinforce the trenches on the key sections of the west bank, drawing on reserves which had been assembled close to the canal. British and French warships entered the canal and took up their stations.` [[link]](https://archive.org/details/lastcrusadepales0000bruc/mode/2up?view=theater) - The Last Crusade: The Palestine Campaign in the First World War, Anthony Bruce
    
- On 1 February 1915, the first shots were fired from the British to the Turkish forces.
    
    > `On 1 February, HMS Clio opened fire on enemy units in the desert east of El Ferdan.  
    >   
    > By the beginning of February, some 15,000 Turkish troops had passed along the central Sinai route and arrived in the Ismailia area. They had been served well by their Bedouin guides and not a single Turkish soldier (or animal) lost his life. As elsewhere on the canal, the great majority of the British defending force was entrenched on the west bank, but defensive positions had also been built on the east side. In the central sector, there were five such posts, each manned by two companies of Indian infantry. On the west bank, between Lake Timsah and the Great Bitter Lake, there were twelve posts, each manned by two platoons. Each platoon was responsible for the defence of about 600 yards of canal frontage. These defensive arrangements were supported by a reserve of three companies, based at Serapeum, and two gun batteries.`

- On 3 February 1915, the raid on the Suez Canal begins.
    
    > `The sandstorm continued into the night and only in the early hours of 3 February could the Turkish assault on the canal begin. British troops at an observation post at Tussum provided the first evidence of the final preparations for an enemy attack. At 3.25 a.m., members of the Turkish 25th Division, an Arab unit, passed southeast of the post in the direction of the canal, apparently in relatively good order at this point. Not long after Turkish troops had been observed at Tussum, the British saw the enemy making its first attempt to cross the canal. In the words of the official historian, ‘dark masses were discerned moving slowly down the gullies on the east bank towards the water. Presently these masses were discovered to be pontoons and rafts carried by squads of men.’` [[link]](https://archive.org/details/lastcrusadepales0000bruc/mode/2up?view=theater) - The Last Crusade: The Palestine Campaign in the First World War, Anthony Bruce
    
- The Ottoman Suez Expeditionary Force suffered the loss of some 1,500 men including 716 prisoners and the British had a low casualty rate due to the Turkish attempts of surprising the British failing by being spotted early by HMS Clio.
    
    > `British inaction gave the Turks time to consider their next move. Although they had suffered the loss of some 1,500 men, including 716 taken prisoner, their 10th Division remained unscathed. However, morale had undoubtedly been damaged by the failure of their first operation to make any impact either on the canal or its defences. Nor was there any sign of a popular response to the invasion within Egypt itself, and it was evident that no assistance from that direction could be expected in the future. Without such popular support, the wider objectives of the invasion could not be achieved, given the marked imbalance in strength of the opposing forces. In his account of the Sinai campaign, Kress claimed that  
    >   
    > 'Djemal Pasha had expected that his appearance on the canal would be followed by a rising of the Egyptian nationalists. In this hope he was deceived. There remained, however, an attainable goal, to force his way suddenly astride the canal, hold the crossing for a few days, and in that time close the canal permanently.'  
    >   
    > However, without the element of surprise, even this more limited objective remained beyond the Turkish army’s grasp.`  
    > [[link]](https://archive.org/details/lastcrusadepales0000bruc/mode/2up?view=theater) - The Last Crusade: The Palestine Campaign in the First World War, Anthony Bruce
    
- On 3 February 1915, The Commander-In-Chief of the Ottoman-Turkish Forces in the Syria and Palestine regions orders a retreat of the forces to prevent further casualties.
    
    > `Djemal Pasha, commander-in-chief in Syria and Palestine, had accompanied the invasion force to the canal and it was he who, on 3 February, decided that an orderly withdrawal was all that could now be achieved. Although he had little talent as a soldier, he was realistic enough to recognize that renewing the attack could result in the complete destruction of the Turkish force and a further heavy blow to Turkish prestige. The only consolation for the Turks was the fact that the invasion force had been able to disengage without difficulty and return to its forward base without any interference by the British.` [[link]](https://archive.org/details/lastcrusadepales0000bruc/mode/2up?view=theater) - The Last Crusade: The Palestine Campaign in the First World War, Anthony Bruce
    
- Attempts to minimize the loss of the raid were attempted by the Turks and Germans by trying to redefine the purpose for the raid on the Suez Canal.
    
    > `Later the Turks and their German allies would try to minimize the stated purpose of the expedition, claiming that it was no more than a reconnaissance or an attempt to destroy part of the fabric of the canal. Even if such rationalizations are accepted, the methods employed were hardly equal to the task. For reasons that are not clear they used their weaker division in the attack and kept the stronger 10th Division in reserve. (This latter division was used at no time during the invasion.) Moreover their diversionary actions to the north and south were weak and unconvincing, and failed to draw British troops away from the main expected area of attack. The Turks were thus obliged to face the full strength of the defending forces when they attacked the British centre. The results, according to Yigal Sheffy, a specialist in the history of military intelligence, were fatal to the Turkish cause:  
    >   
    > ”Had Cemal [Djemal Pasha] implemented the principle of force optimization by bringing in the sizeable force available in the rear, invested his better trained troops in the first wave, and pressed the defenders on the flanks, he would have had a much better prospect for securing the east bank opposite Serapeum and establishing a beachhead on the west bank.”  
    >   
    > Given that the capture of the canal was possibly the most valuable contribution it could have made to the cause of its allies, it seems likely that the Turkish army’s half-hearted attack with insignificant numbers had a wider political explanation.`

### 1917 Tel Aviv & Jaffa Deportation
- In March - April 1917, The Tel Aviv and Jaffa deportation was the evacuation of 10,000 people from Jaffa, including Tel Aviv, by the authorities of the Ottoman Empire in Palestine. This was a reaction to the [[Israel-Palestine Contents Page]] & [[Israel-Palestine Contents Page]] Gaza Battles and the Jewish inhabitants possibly assisting the British forces.
- The Commander-In-Chief of the Ottoman-Turkish Forces in the Syria and Palestine regions was possibly concerned about Jewish inhabitants assisting the British forces. The Yishuv organised a crisis committee to help reduce the possible catastrophe with the deportation and has been attributed to reducing the human toll.
    
    > `At the end of March 1917, on the threshold of the Pesach festival, the Jewish community of Tel Aviv and Jaffa was ordered to evacuate their homes. Fully one-fifth of the evacuees perished, owing to the difficult conditions of the transfer. Djemal Pasha justified the order by the threat of British naval attacks on the community. Since no similar orders were issued to Haifa or Beirut, it is probable that he was concerned with the assistance the Jews would offer the already advancing British troops. The vicious and ruthless manner in which the order was carried out exemplify Djemal Pasha’s attitude towards his subjects.  
    >   
    > When the extent of the economic depression and political oppression was realized, a “‘crisis-relief committee’ was formed in Jaffa headed by Meir Dizengoff, the mayor of Tel Aviv. Various emergency measures were taken to relieve the widespread suffering and hunger. Public kitchens were established, all available land was sown for additional food, and the communities of the Galilee and Samaria — which were relatively mildly affected — were asked to share their produce with their less fortunate brethren.  
    >   
    > The committee was also active in minimizing the anguish of the banished foreign nationals. Often family members became separated at the point of departure, and not even the committee’s good offices, contacts, and bribes could influence sadistic officials to permit their reunion. The evacuation of Jaffa and Tel Aviv would have been even more costly in terms of human lives, were it not for the efforts of Dizengoff and his committee who organized the evacuation in an orderly manner.`

- New Historian Tom Segev wrote a piece for Haaretz in 2009 on the deportation.
    
    > `In the spring of 1917, roads in the south of the country overflowed with tens of thousands of refugees. The Turks who then ruled the land had expelled them from Gaza. It happened after the British had twice failed in their attempts to conquer Gaza. Moshe Smilansky, a farmer and writer who wandered a good deal among the Arabs, saw the waves of refugees and described them in his journal: "All of them bear the mark of hunger, fear and disaster." The disaster was not theirs alone, he wrote: "A terrible panic befell not only the residents of Gaza, but the entire land." Because, he maintained, the authorities intended to resettle some of the Arab refugees in communities belonging to the Jews: "We were very fearful about these guests, because of the overcrowding, lack of cleanliness, and disruption of the usual order. But still we took comfort in this - better that they expel the Arabs to us than that they should expel us to them," Smilansky observed. Little did he know.  
    >   
    > A few weeks later, the residents of Jaffa and Tel Aviv were also forced to leave their homes; some of them found shelter among Arabs.  
    >   
    > Around 50,000 people lived in Jaffa at that time, including some 10,000 Jews; nearly 2,000 Jews lived in the adjacent garden suburb, Tel Aviv. The authorities claimed they had to vacate Jaffa for their own protection. The military governor of the country was Cemal Pasha, one of the leaders of the Young Turk movement, who is also known as the mastermind behind the Armenian genocide. As with the expulsion of the civilian population from Gaza, the authorities claimed that Jaffa's evacuation was necessary to protect the residents, ahead of the British invasion. "You cannot fight for a city to the sound of women screaming and children crying," Cemal Pasha explained.  
    >   
    > A foreign diplomat stationed in Jerusalem at the time offered the view that the authorities were hostile to the Jews of Jaffa and Tel Aviv, and would take advantage of the evacuation to harm the Zionists. He was right: Only a few Jewish youths were given permission to remain in the city to safeguard the houses. All the rest were forced to get out.  
    >   
    > A deathly silence  
    >   
    > The evacuation took about two weeks. It began in an orderly fashion, but rapidly descended into chaos. A local reporter described a confused mob of people, horses and mules, and piles and piles of belongings. Men, women and children were stretched out over their bundles, waiting outside day and night for their turn, until a cart would arrive to collect them. Wagon after wagon departed, numbering in the hundreds: wagons laden with household wares and carpets, heavy furniture and even pianos; wagons full of Torah scrolls from the synagogues; and wagons carrying wheat and other foodstuffs. They left behind them a long trail of animal excrement. Moshe Smilansky saw a baby carriage hitched to a donkey and driven by two children.`

### 1918 Armistice of Mudros
- On 30 October 1918, the Armistice of Mudros ended hostilities in the Middle Eastern theatre between the Ottoman Empire and the Allies of World War I. It was signed by the Ottoman Minister of Marine Affairs Rauf Bey and British Admiral Somerset Arthur Gough-Calthorpe, on board HMS Agamemnon in Mudros harbour on the Greek island of Lemnos.
- The armistice was followed by the occupation of Constantinople (now Istanbul) and the subsequent partitioning of the Ottoman Empire. The Treaty of Sèvres (10 August 1920), which was signed in the aftermath of World War I, imposed harsh terms on the Ottoman Empire, but it was never ratified by the Ottoman Parliament in Istanbul.

- > `From the beginning of the war, the Turks had feared a revolt and fifthcolumn activities by Arab nationalists in Damascus and Beirut. At first they tried to conquer Egypt; failing in this, they tried to ward off British counterthrusts toward Palestine and Syria. In 1915-16 Jamal Pasha, commander of the Ottoman Fourth Army and military governor of the Greater Syria region, instituted a reign of terror in which dozens of Arab nationalists were publicly hanged in Damascus and Beirut and hundreds were arrested. Thousands more Palestinian Arabs (as well as Jews) were deported inland, away from the centers of subversion and from likely axes of Allied invasion (and all this even before any concrete anti-Ottoman subversion had taken place). Additional thousands died of disease and starvation, in part as a result of the Ottoman military requisitioning of crops. These events naturally served to intensify Arab nationalist and separatist aspirations.

- The Mandate for Palestine was a League of Nations mandate for British administration of the territories of Palestine and Transjordan, both of which had been conceded by the Ottoman Empire following the end of World War I in 1918.
### 1920 San Remo Resolution
- On 25 April 1920, The Mandate for Palestine was assigned to Britain by the San Remo conference, after France's concession in the [[Israel-Palestine Contents Page]] of the previously-agreed "international administration" of Palestine under the [[Israel-Palestine Contents Page]].
- The San Remo Resolution determined the allocation of Class A League of Nations mandates for the administration of three then-undefined Ottoman territories in the Middle East: Palestine, Syria and Mesopotamia (modern day Iraq). The boundaries of the three territories were "to be determined [at a later date] by the Principal Allied Powers”

### 1921 Cairo Conference
- On 12-30 March 1921, The Cairo Conference was a series of meetings by British officials for examining and discussing Middle Eastern problems resolving the conflicting policies defined in the [[Israel-Palestine Contents Page]], the [[Israel-Palestine Contents Page]] and the [[Israel-Palestine Contents Page]], and to frame a common policy. The secret conference of British experts created the blueprint for British control in both Iraq and Transjordan. The Sherifian Solution was offering nominal leadership of those two regions to the sons of the Sharif of the Mecca, Colonial Secretary Winston Churchill felt that the spirit if not the actual letter of Britain's wartime promises to the Arabs were fulfilled.
- The conference was heralded as a success in regards of setting up the UKs policy in the Middle East with Arab leaders leading the new Arab world.
    
    > `given the accumulated grievances over past and present details of Great Britain's policy, or lack of policy, toward the Arab world, the speech by Churchill was regarded as a triumph for his fresh initiative. He had succeeded in gaining Cabinet endorsement, in placating Parliament, and in marshaling public support for his effort in the Middle East — this at a time when Great Britain was straining under the threat of labor strikes and the Irish rebellion and with the London Conference on Turkey having ended in disappointment Yet whatever the reaction at home, the Cairo Conference could succeed or fail only to the extent that its decisions were properly implemented in Iraq, Palestine, and Transjordan.` [[link]](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/bafykbzacec7x2rcnzqsydbnnllvr72xvmmr7jbgyb46tq2c3mvq4haanmxbs6?filename=Aaron%20Klieman%20-%20Foundations%20Of%20British%20Policy%20In%20The%20Arab%20World_%20The%20Cairo%20Conference%20Of%201921-Johns%20Hopkins%20University%20Press%20%281970%29.pdf) - Foundations of British Policy in the Arab World: The Cairo Conference of 1921, Aaron Klieman
    
### 1922 League of Nations Approves the Mandate for Palestine
- On 24 July 1922, The Palestine mandate was approved at a private meeting of the Council of the League of Nations at St. James Palace in London giving the British formal international recognition of the position they had held de facto in the region since the end of 1917 in Palestine and since 1920–21 in Transjordan.
    
    > `On 24 July 1922, in a session held at St. James Palace in London, the Council of the League of Nations finally gave its approval to the British Mandate in Palestine. This decision climaxed a long, arduous struggle on the part of the British to gain formal international recognition of their suzerainty in the Holy Land, which had existed de facto since December 1917. The document which was approved, however, the draft mandate, had itself been the product of difficult negotiations, this time between the British Foreign Office and the Zionist Organization. These negotiations were highly significant, for they determined the ground rules which were to govern the relationship between future British administrations and the Zionists: the mandate outlined the Zionist role in the government, in the allotment of land, and in the economic development of the country. Yet for some reason, this entire issue has been largely overlooked in studies of the mandate. Hopefully, this article will demonstrate that these negotiations have not merited such inattention.` [[link]](https://moscow.sci-hub.se/4912/6901217a67ed103efffc0c79dbb9e38a/10.2307@4467095.pdf\#navpanes=0&view=FitH)

## 1964-67 War Over Water (Jordan River)
- [[link]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_over_Water_(Jordan_River))
- Water sharing from the Jordan-Yarmuk system turned out to be a major problem between Israel, Syria and Jordan.
    - The Yarmuk River is where the borders of Israel, Jordan and Syria converge.
- Israel began construction of an intake for its National Water Carrier at the Daughters of Jacob Bridge in the demilitarized zone north of the Sea of Galilee in July 1953.
- Syria protested to the UN, then artillery fired upon the construction site.
- UN Security Council voted to allow Israel to resume work, but it was vetoed by the Soviet Union.
- In 1955, the US brokered a deal, the Jordan Valley Unified Water Plan (Johnston Plan), and was accepted by technical committees of Israel and the Arab League.
- In January 1964 an [Arab League summit meeting convened in Cairo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1964_Arab_League_summit_(Cairo)) and decided:
    
    > “The establishment of Israel is the basic threat that the Arab nation in its entirety has agreed to forestall. And since the existence of Israel is a danger that threatens the Arab nation, the diversion of the Jordan waters by it multiplies the dangers to Arab existence. Accordingly, the Arab states have to prepare the plans necessary for dealing with the political, economic, and social aspects, so that if the necessary results are not achieved, collective Arab military preparations, when they are completed, will constitute the ultimate practical means for the final liquidation of Israel.”
    
- When the Arab states realized they couldn’t win militarily, they attempted to divert the Jordan River headwaters to the Yarmouk River. Israel declared it was an infringement on its sovereign rights.
## 1970-71 Black September
- [[link]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_September)
- On 6 September 1970
Background
- Jordan's population right now consisted 2/3rds of Palestinians, and only 1/3rd of Jordanians. Nasser's political support also strengthened the Palestinians position.
- Palestinian fedayeen enclaves in Jordan began to set up "independent republics" where they attempted to set up checkpoints and tax citizens.
- In September of 1970, members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine hijacked four airliners bound for New York City and one for London. Explosives were used to destroy the empty planes for the press.
- King Hussein saw this as the last straw, and threat to his rule, and decided to take action against the PLO presence in Jordan.
- Jordan allowed the fedayeen to relocate to Lebanon via Syria, where four years later they would become involved in the Lebanese Civil War.
- The Palestinian Black September Organization was founded afterwards to punish Jordan for its expulsion, resulting in the assassination of Jordanian prime minister Wasfi Tal in 1971 due to his command of the military during operations against the fedayeen.
    - This organization also carried out a terrorist attack during the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, West Germany, with 8 members killing 11 Israeli coaches and athletes, as well as 1 West German police officer.
- By 1970, different factions within the PLO called for the overthrow of Jordan's king, Hussein.
- Hussein attempted to appease the fedayeen with an edict, and with the support of Nasser, though this failed and the fedayeen continued to grow in opposition. Libya, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait openly supported the fedayeen.
- Israel guaranteed Jordan that they would not push territorial boundaries if Jordan withdraw troops from the border for a PLO confrontation.
- On the 7th of June, Hussein's motorcade came under heavy fire by fedayeen soldiers while attempting to visit the _mukhabarat_ headquarters.
- A ceasefire was attempted to be called after retaliation, though the PFLP did not abide by it and instead held 68 foreign nationals hostage in two Amman hotels, threatening to blow them up if Jordan did not dismiss their Special Forces and some military leaders.
- By August, Arafat seemed to have wanted to stage a revolution in Jordan.
- The PFLP began hijacking planes to bring attention to the Palestinian problem.
- In September, Hussein begins to capture his capital and attempts to push the fedayeen out of Jordanian cities and refugee camps.
    - Syrian forces, 10,000 strong, with PLA markings marched towards Irbid to support the fedayeen.
    - 17,000 Iraqi troops remained in Jordan after the 6-day war, causing concern that they may intervene.
- The US stationed a navy fleet to be positioned off the coast of Israel, near Jordan.
- Israel mobilized troops to begin to support Jordan, readying its air force to discourage Syrian troops with sonic booms.
- Arafat and Hussein signed a peace deal on the 27th of September, brokered by Nasser.
- Iranian leftist guerilla organizations sided with the PLO during the conflict, bombing the Jordanian embassy in Tehran during King Hussein's state visit in revenge of the events of Black September.
- Casualties: Palestinians between 2,000-3,4000, Syrians with 600 casualties, and Jordanian Armed Forces with 537 dead.
- In 1972, the 3 surviving PLO terrorists from the Munich massacre were traded in exchange of the hostages taken on the hijacking of Lufthansa Flight 615.
