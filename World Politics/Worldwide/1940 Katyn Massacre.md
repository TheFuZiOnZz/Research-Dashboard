#### 1940 Katyn Massacre
- [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katyn_massacre)
- The Katyn massacre was a series of mass executions of 22,000 Polish military officers and intelligentsia prisoners of war carried out by the Soviet Union, specifically the NKVD ("People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs", the Soviet secret police) in April and May 1940 as a part of the secret sections of the [[1939 Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]].
    - `In March 1959 the KGB chief A.Shelepin wrote to Khrushchev requesting permission to dispose of the files concerning the 21 857 Poles who were shot as a result of this Politburo resolution. See Materski (ed.), pp. 26-28. Shelepin indicates that of the 21,857 Poles executed, 4,421 were executed near Katyn Forest in Smolensk oblast', 3,820 in Starobelsk in Kharkhov oblast', 6,311 in Ostashkov in Kalinin oblast' and 7,305 elsewhere. Since the Germans claim to have discovered 10,000 bodies in Katyn, it remains unclear who the other 5,500 victims in Katyn were.` - [The scale and nature of German and Soviet repression and mass killings, 1930–45, Steven Wheatcroft, 1996](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1080%2F09668139608412415)
- The Nazi Government were the first to report the discovered burial grounds in Katyn Forest.
    - `In mid-April 1943 the German government announced the discovery of the remains of several thousand Polish officers from Kozelsk camp buried in Katyn Forest, near Smolensk.` - Katyn: a crime without punishment, Anna M. Cienciala & Wojciech Materski, 2007
- The Soviets broke off talks in 1943 after the Polish government had demanded an independent examination of the discovered Katyn burial pits by the International Red Cross.
    - `Joseph Stalin broke off relations with the Polish government after it rejected his demand to blame the Germans and requested the International Red Cross to investigate the massacre. In spring–summer 1943, German, Polish, and other forensic experts examined the exhumed bodies and concluded that the crime had been committed on the orders of the Soviet authorities who now accused the Germans.` - Katyn: a crime without punishment, Anna M.

    - `Copy of the Soviet Note of April 25, 1943, severing unilaterally Soviet-Polish diplomatic relations. Note served verbally to the Polish Ambassador in Moscow, Tadeusz Romer in response to the Polish Government’s request of April 17, 1943 that the mass burial site of murdered Polish officers, discovered by the Germans in Katyn, be examined by an independent and impartial body - the International Red Cross.` - Katyn: a crime without punishment, Anna M. Cienciala & Wojciech Materski, 2007
    - `Both, the Polish Government and the Hitlerite government drew into the "investigation" the International Red Cross, compelled to participate in this farce of investigation in which Hitler appears to be the stage manager, in conditions of a terroristic regime with its gallows and mass extermination of the peaceful population. Understandably, such an "investigation", conducted behind the back of the Soviet Government, can not command confidence of people, possessing any degree of honesty.` - Katyn: a crime without punishment, Anna M. Cienciala & Wojciech Materski, 2007
- In 1990, Gorbachev recognised around 20% of the murders committed by the Red Army.
    - `The Soviet government officially accepts blame for the Katyn Massacre of World War II, when nearly 5,000 Polish military officers were murdered and buried in mass graves in the Katyn Forest. The admission was part of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev’s promise to be more forthcoming and candid concerning Soviet history.` - [Soviets admit to Katyn Massacre of World War II, History](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/soviets-admit-to-katyn-massacre)
- In 2010, the Russian State Duma then recognised the full amount of the murders committed by the Red Army.
    - `In November 2010, the Russian State Duma took a big step toward healing a decades-old rift with Poland by officially accepting Soviet responsibility for the Katyn massacre -- the mass killing of some 22,000 Polish military officers, religious figures, and intelligentsia in 1940. "Published documents, kept in classified archives for many years, not only revealed the scale of this horrific tragedy, but also showed that the Katyn crime was carried out on direct orders of Stalin and other Soviet officials," the declaration read,` - [After 80 Years, The 'Katyn Lie' Lives On In Russia, RadioFreeEurope RadioLiberty, 2020](https://www.rferl.org/a/after-80-years-the-katyn-lie-lives-on-in-russia/30470317.html)
