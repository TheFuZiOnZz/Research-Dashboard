#### 1941 Sikorski–Mayski Agreement
- On 30 July 1941, The Sikorski–Mayski agreement was a treaty between the Soviet Union and Poland that was signed in London. Its name is taken from its two most notable signatories: the prime minister of Poland, Władysław Sikorski, and the Soviet ambassador to the United Kingdom, Ivan Mayski.
- Stalin agreed to declare all previous pacts that he had with Nazi Germany null and void, to invalidate the September 1939 partition of Poland and to release tens of thousands of Polish prisoners-of-war held in Soviet camps. Pursuant to an agreement between the Polish government-in-exile and Stalin, the Soviets granted "amnesty" to many Polish citizens on 12 August 1941.
    - `1. The Government of the U.S.S.R. recognizes the Soviet-German treaties of 1939 as to territorial changes in Poland as having lost their validity. The Polish Government declares Poland is not bound by any agreement with any third power which is directed against the U.S.S.R.`
      
      `2. Diplomatic relations will be restored between the two governments upon the signing of this agreement, and an immediate exchange of Ambassadors will be arranged. The two governments mutually agree to render one to another aid and support of all kinds in the present war against Hitlerite Germany.`
      
      `3. The Government of the U.S.S.R. expresses its consent to the formation on territory of the U.S.S.R. of a Polish Army under a commander appointed by the Polish Government in agreement with the Soviet Government, the Polish Army on territory of the U.S.S.R. being subordinated in an operational sense to the Supreme Command of the U.S.S.R., in which the Polish Army will be represented. All details as to command, organization and employment of this force will be settled in a subsequent agreement.`
      
      `4. This agreement will come into force immediately upon signature and without ratification. The present agreement is drawn up in two copies, in the Russian and Polish languages. Both texts have equal force.`
      
      `The Soviet Government grants amnesty to all Polish citizens now detained on Soviet territory either as prisoners of war or on other sufficient grounds, as from the resumption of diplomatic relations.` - [link](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/bafykbzacedk4o3mawvpupcurbvzmdnxqcrs4jybzzc4rnxtj6w77pf7x6pkga?filename=J%C3%B3zef%20Garli%C5%84ski%20%28auth.%29%20-%20Poland%20in%20the%20Second%20World%20War-Palgrave%20Macmillan%20UK%20%281985%29.pdf)
    
- The Soviets broke off talks again in 1943 after the Polish government had demanded an independent examination of the recently discovered [Katyn burial pits](https://www.notion.so/Geo-Politics-8ab38a7f4fb84ec09ae3895794c0539c?pvs=21) by the International Red Cross.
    
    - `Copy of the Soviet Note of April 25, 1943, severing unilaterally Soviet-Polish diplomatic relations. Note served verbally to the Polish Ambassador in Moscow, Tadeusz Romer in response to the Polish Government’s request of April 17, 1943 that the mass burial site of murdered Polish officers, discovered by the Germans in Katyn, be examined by an independent and impartial body - the International Red Cross.` ... `Both, the Polish Government and the Hitlerite government drew into the "investigation" the International Red Cross, compelled to participate in this farce of investigation in which Hitler appears to be the stage manager, in conditions of a terroristic regime with its gallows and mass extermination of the peaceful population. Understandably, such an "investigation", conducted behind the back of the Soviet Government, can not command confidence of people, possessing any degree of honesty.` - [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20050909042329/http://www.electronicmuseum.ca/Poland-WW2/katyn_memorial_wall/kmw_note.html)

### Notes

- While many of the historic crimes were committed during Soviet era, there is a overlap of Stalin apologists in Marxist-Leninist circles and “oppose the west, support the rest” anti-USA far-right reactionaries thus contemporary sources about Tatar persecution under both Ukraine and Russian Federation as continuum from Imperial Russia and USSR is needed
- Some collaborated with fascist Germany but most did not.
- Many were glad at first from the Red Army liberating Crimea from germany
- 20,000 troops sent to punish the entire group for the crimes of a small group
- The NKVD struck all villages at once, quickly forced them out of their homes and deported even those who fought in the front and won awards etc. A third died in the process. People were shocked and didn’t believe that stalin would do this
- Stalin did the same thing to Chechens and kelmiks almost a million people
- Roma (Gypsy) communities that were integrated with Tatars were also deported by the Soviets: “On 18 May 1944 the Soviet authorities, on returning to the Crimea, also composed the trains of the Tatars to be deported based on the German lists, thus including the Gypsies listed as Tatars.”
- “In 1944 Crimean Tatar speaking Gypsies were also deported...They were perceived as Gypsies, which is why they were predetermined for annihilation from the Nazis during World War II but, according to Soviet statistics, they were defined as Tatars and so they were deported by the Soviet authorities, alongside the Crimean Tatars..." from “Gypsies in Central Asia and the Caucasus” by Elena Marushiakova and Vesselin Popov
- By adopting the new language law, Ukraine has implicitly abandoned the idea of returning Crimea
