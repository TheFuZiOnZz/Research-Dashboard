## 1940 Tripartite Pact
- The Tripartite Pact, also known as the Berlin Pact, was an agreement between Germany, Italy, and Japan signed in Berlin on 27 September 1940 by, respectively, Joachim von Ribbentrop, Galeazzo Ciano and Saburō Kurusu. It was a defensive military alliance that was eventually joined by Hungary (20 November 1940), Romania (23 November 1940), Bulgaria (1 March 1941) and Yugoslavia (25 March 1941) as well as by the German client state of Slovakia (24 November 1940).
- The pact included mention of that its formation that the pact wouldn’t effect Soviet Russia

## 1941 Invasion of the Soviet Union, Operation Barbarossa
- Operation Barbarossa was the invasion of the Soviet Union by Nazi Germany and most of the Axis leaders, starting on 22 June 1941 which made the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact then unofficially terminated and then officially terminated on 30 July 1941 in the Sikorski–Mayski Agreement.
- Stalin was caught off but this invasion by the Nazis and thought reports from Soviet agents warning him of a potential invasion were the Nazi’s hard-balling for more economic concessions.
    
    > `For all its multinational trimmings, therefore, ‘Operation Barbarossa’ was thus in essence to be a German operation. As the winter snows of East-Central Europe melted and the ground thawed, the German armed forces began moving vast masses of men and equipment up to the Soviet border. Throughout May and early June 1941, Zygmunt Klukowski recorded endless columns of German troops and vehicles passing through his region of Poland, noting the passage of between 500 and 600 vehicles on 14 June alone, for example. Stalin hurriedly launched a futile policy of trying to appease the Germans by stepping up Soviet deliveries of Asian rubber and other supplies under the trade agreement signed in January 1941. As a dogmatic Marxist-Leninist, Stalin was convinced that Hitler’s regime was the tool of German monopoly capitalism, so that if he made available everything German business wanted, there would be no immediate reason to invade. Already, under trade provisions agreed under the Nazi-Soviet Pact early the previous year, the Soviet Union was supplying nearly threequarters of Germany’s requirement of phosphates, over two-thirds of its imported asbestos, only a little less of its chrome ore, over half its manganese, over a third of its imported nickel, and, even more crucially, more than a third of its imported oil. Stalin personally vetoed proposals to disrupt the German military build-up by attacking across the Polish demarcation line. Reports from Soviet agents and even from members of the German embassy in Moscow that an invasion was imminent only convinced him that the Germans were playing hard-ball in their drive to extract economic concessions from him.` [link] - The Third Reich at war, Richard Evans
    
- Stalin’s trust in Soviet intelligence agents was low because of the relaying of correct Nazi planned dates that were delayed, and Stalin interpreting that as people pushing him towards preemptive war with Germany and when informed by a deserted Nazi soldier of the what became the true date of the invasion, Stalin had him shot for spreading disinformation.
    
    > `At the same time, Stalin realized that, as he told graduating military cadets in Moscow on 5 May 1941, ‘War with Germany is inevitable.’ Molotov might be able to postpone it for two or three months, but in the meantime it was vital to ‘re-teach our army and our commanders. Educate them in the spirit of attack.’ Delivered to young officers as a rhetorical message for the future, this was not a statement of intent. Stalin did not believe that the Red Army would be ready to deal with the Germans until 1942 or perhaps even 1943. Not only had the General Staff not drawn up any plans for an attack on the German forces, it had no plans for a defence against them either. Although the Germans mounted a large and sophisticated deception plan to conceal the true nature of their intentions, Soviet intelligence began to send in accurate reports that the invasion was planned for around 22 June 1941. But Stalin would not listen. Earlier reports that the invasion plans were to become operational on 15 May 1941, though correct at the time, proved wrong when the Germans delayed Barbarossa in order to mount the invasion of Greece and Yugoslavia. Hitler later blamed Mussolini for the consequences, but in fact the weather in East-Central Europe in these weeks would have made an invasion of the Soviet Union inadvisable even had the German Leader not been obliged to step in to rescue his Italian ally from the imbroglio in Southern Europe. The Soviet agents who had made the prediction lost all credibility as a result. The capitalist forces in Britain, including the exiled Polish government, seemed to Stalin’s narrow and suspicious mind to be feeding false information to him about German intentions in order to lure him into a battle. Surely in any case the German Leader would not invade while the conflict with Britain was still unresolved. When an ex-Communist soldier deserted the German forces on 21 June 1941 and swam across a river to tell the Russians on the other side that his unit had been given orders to invade the following morning, Stalin had him shot for spreading ‘disinformation’.` [link] - The Third Reich at war, Richard Evans
    
- The Red Army had little time to correct its numerous deficiencies before Nazi Germany and other Axis countries allied with it swept across the newly relocated Soviet border on June 22, 1941, in the opening stages of Operation Barbarossa.
    
    > `The twenty-second of June 1941 is one of the most significant days in the history of Europe. The German invasion of the Soviet Union that began that day under the cryptonym Operation Barbarossa was much more than a surprise attack, a shift of alliances, or a new stage in a war. It was the beginning of a calamity that defies description. The engagement of the Wehrmacht (and its allies) with the Red Army killed more than ten million soldiers, not to speak of the comparable number of civilians who died in flight, under bombs, or of hunger and disease as a result of the war on the eastern front` [link](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafykbzaceccblw5ub3z5dqoqr5pbwybapejk3bv2ppkfsemkk7ooi7lhrjfcm?filename=Timothy+Snyder+-+Bloodlands_+Europe+between+Hitler+and+Stalin-Basic+Books+%282010%29.pdf) - Bloodlands: Europe between Hitler and Stalin, Timothy Snyder
    
- Hitler thought Stalin was the safer option to side with compared to the Polish.
    
    > `Hitler himself later explained his failure to conclude a new nonaggression pact with Poland by his lack of confidence in the Poles. They were within striking distance of vital industrial areas in eastern Germany and Bohemia, and he believed they would take the first possible opportunity to stab Germany in the back. Stalin, who in Hitlers opinion could not risk a war under any circumstances, was in that respect a safer treaty partner, as well as being several hundred kilometers farther removed from the German border. Once Hitler had convinced himself he could not rely on Poland, he evidently decided Poland would have to eliminated before he took action against the West. Just when he made the decision to attack Poland, however, is difficult to determine.` [link](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/bafykbzacebi7fvuwrky3v3ggchh6zwcupwfb6on22zaennjlbo3loolhsl5yy?filename=%28Hitler%27s%20War%20Aims%29%20Norman%20Rich%20-%20Hitler%27s%20War%20Aims_%20Ideology%2C%20the%20Nazi%20State%2C%20and%20the%20Course%20of%20Expansion-W.%20W.%20Norton%20%20Company%20%281992%29.pdf) - Hitler's war aims, Norman Rich
    
- Hitler expected the Operation to not take as much time as it did.
    
    > `Operation Barbarossa was supposed to be quick and decisive, bringing a “lightning victory” within three months at the latest. Yet while the Red Army fell back, it did not collapse.` [link](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/bafykbzaceccblw5ub3z5dqoqr5pbwybapejk3bv2ppkfsemkk7ooi7lhrjfcm?filename=Timothy%20Snyder%20-%20Bloodlands_%20Europe%20between%20Hitler%20and%20Stalin-Basic%20Books%20%282010%29.pdf) - Bloodlands: Europe between Hitler and Stalin, Timothy Snyder
    
- During the initial stages of the war, Soviet forces were often ordered to stand their ground despite limited defensive capabilities, resulting in numerous encirclements and correspondingly high numbers of casualties.
    
    > `The organization of the camps in the east revealed a contempt for life, the life of Slavs and Asians and Jews anyway, that made such mass starvation thinkable. In German prisoner-of-war camps for Red Army soldiers, the death rate over the course of the war was 57.5 percent. In the first eight months after Operation Barbarossa, it must have been far higher. In German prisoner-of-war camps for soldiers of the western Allies, the death rate was less than five percent.` [link](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafykbzaceccblw5ub3z5dqoqr5pbwybapejk3bv2ppkfsemkk7ooi7lhrjfcm?filename=Timothy+Snyder+-+Bloodlands_+Europe+between+Hitler+and+Stalin-Basic+Books+%282010%29.pdf) - Bloodlands: Europe between Hitler and Stalin, Timothy Snyder

- On 20 May – 1 June 1941 The Battle of Crete , codenamed Operation Mercury, was a major Axis airborne and amphibious operation to capture the island of Crete.
- It began on the morning of 20 May 1941, with multiple German airborne landings on Crete. Greek and other Allied forces, along with Cretan civilians, defended the island.
## 1941 Sikorski–Mayski Agreement
- On 30 July 1941, The Sikorski–Mayski agreement was a treaty between the Soviet Union and Poland that was signed in London. Its name is taken from its two most notable signatories: the prime minister of Poland, Władysław Sikorski, and the Soviet ambassador to the United Kingdom, Ivan Mayski.
- Stalin agreed to declare all previous pacts that he had with Nazi Germany null and void, to invalidate the September 1939 partition of Poland and to release tens of thousands of Polish prisoners-of-war held in Soviet camps. Pursuant to an agreement between the Polish government-in-exile and Stalin, the Soviets granted "amnesty" to many Polish citizens on 12 August 1941.
    - `1. The Government of the U.S.S.R. recognizes the Soviet-German treaties of 1939 as to territorial changes in Poland as having lost their validity. The Polish Government declares Poland is not bound by any agreement with any third power which is directed against the U.S.S.R.  
          
        2. Diplomatic relations will be restored between the two governments upon the signing of this agreement, and an immediate exchange of Ambassadors will be arranged. The two governments mutually agree to render one to another aid and support of all kinds in the present war against Hitlerite Germany.  
          
        3. The Government of the U.S.S.R. expresses its consent to the formation on territory of the U.S.S.R. of a Polish Army under a commander appointed by the Polish Government in agreement with the Soviet Government, the Polish Army on territory of the U.S.S.R. being subordinated in an operational sense to the Supreme Command of the U.S.S.R., in which the Polish Army will be represented. All details as to command, organization and employment of this force will be settled in a subsequent agreement.  
          
        4. This agreement will come into force immediately upon signature and without ratification. The present agreement is drawn up in two copies, in the Russian and Polish languages. Both texts have equal force.  
          
        The Soviet Government grants amnesty to all Polish citizens now detained on Soviet territory either as prisoners of war or on other sufficient grounds, as from the resumption of diplomatic relations.`

- The Soviets broke off talks again in 1943 after the Polish government had demanded an independent examination of the recently discovered [Katyn burial pits](https://www.notion.so/Geo-Politics-8ab38a7f4fb84ec09ae3895794c0539c?pvs=21) by the International Red Cross.
    - `Copy of the Soviet Note of April 25, 1943, severing unilaterally Soviet-Polish diplomatic relations. Note served verbally to the Polish Ambassador in Moscow, Tadeusz Romer in response to the Polish Government’s request of April 17, 1943 that the mass burial site of murdered Polish officers, discovered by the Germans in Katyn, be examined by an independent and impartial body - the International Red Cross.` ... `Both, the Polish Government and the Hitlerite government drew into the "investigation" the International Red Cross, compelled to participate in this farce of investigation in which Hitler appears to be the stage manager, in conditions of a terroristic regime with its gallows and mass extermination of the peaceful population. Understandably, such an "investigation", conducted behind the back of the Soviet Government, can not command confidence of people, possessing any degree of honesty.` [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20050909042329/http://www.electronicmuseum.ca/Poland-WW2/katyn_memorial_wall/kmw_note.html)

- Scholarship since the fall of the Soviet Union, combined with eyewitness accounts, has questioned Soviet motives and suggested their lack of support for the Warsaw Uprising represented their ambitions in Eastern Europe. The Red Army did not reinforce resistance fighters or provide air support. Declassified documents indicate that Joseph Stalin had tactically halted his forces from advancing on Warsaw in order to exhaust the Polish Home Army and to aid his political desires of turning Poland into a Soviet-aligned state. Scholars note the two month period of the Warsaw Uprising marked the start of the Cold War.

### Notes
- While many of the historic crimes were committed during Soviet era, there is a overlap of Stalin apologists in Marxist-Leninist circles and “oppose the west, support the rest” anti-USA far-right reactionaries thus contemporary sources about Tatar persecution under both Ukraine and Russian Federation as continuum from Imperial Russia and USSR is needed
- Some collaborated with fascist Germany but most did not.
- Many were glad at first from the Red Army liberating Crimea from germany
- 20,000 troops sent to punish the entire group for the crimes of a small group
- The NKVD struck all villages at once, quickly forced them out of their homes and deported even those who fought in the front and won awards etc. A third died in the process. People were shocked and didn’t believe that stalin would do this
- Stalin did the same thing to Chechens and kelmiks almost a million people
- Roma (Gypsy) communities that were integrated with Tatars were also deported by the Soviets: “On 18 May 1944 the Soviet authorities, on returning to the Crimea, also composed the trains of the Tatars to be deported based on the German lists, thus including the Gypsies listed as Tatars.”
- “In 1944 Crimean Tatar speaking Gypsies were also deported...They were perceived as Gypsies, which is why they were predetermined for annihilation from the Nazis during World War II but, according to Soviet statistics, they were defined as Tatars and so they were deported by the Soviet authorities, alongside the Crimean Tatars..." from “Gypsies in Central Asia and the Caucasus” by Elena Marushiakova and Vesselin Popov
- By adopting the new language law, Ukraine has implicitly abandoned the idea of returning Crimea
