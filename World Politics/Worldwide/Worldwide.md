## 1944 Warsaw Uprising
- [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_Uprising)
- On 1 August – 2 October 1944,
- Scholarship since the fall of the Soviet Union, combined with eyewitness accounts, has questioned Soviet motives and suggested their lack of support for the Warsaw Uprising represented their ambitions in Eastern Europe. The Red Army did not reinforce resistance fighters or provide air support. Declassified documents indicate that Joseph Stalin had tactically halted his forces from advancing on Warsaw in order to exhaust the Polish Home Army and to aid his political desires of turning Poland into a Soviet-aligned state. Scholars note the two month period of the Warsaw Uprising marked the start of the Cold War.

### Notes
- While many of the historic crimes were committed during Soviet era, there is a overlap of Stalin apologists in Marxist-Leninist circles and “oppose the west, support the rest” anti-USA far-right reactionaries thus contemporary sources about Tatar persecution under both Ukraine and Russian Federation as continuum from Imperial Russia and USSR is needed
- Some collaborated with fascist Germany but most did not.
- Many were glad at first from the Red Army liberating Crimea from germany
- 20,000 troops sent to punish the entire group for the crimes of a small group
- The NKVD struck all villages at once, quickly forced them out of their homes and deported even those who fought in the front and won awards etc. A third died in the process. People were shocked and didn’t believe that stalin would do this
- Stalin did the same thing to Chechens and kelmiks almost a million people
- Roma (Gypsy) communities that were integrated with Tatars were also deported by the Soviets: “On 18 May 1944 the Soviet authorities, on returning to the Crimea, also composed the trains of the Tatars to be deported based on the German lists, thus including the Gypsies listed as Tatars.”
- “In 1944 Crimean Tatar speaking Gypsies were also deported...They were perceived as Gypsies, which is why they were predetermined for annihilation from the Nazis during World War II but, according to Soviet statistics, they were defined as Tatars and so they were deported by the Soviet authorities, alongside the Crimean Tatars..." from “Gypsies in Central Asia and the Caucasus” by Elena Marushiakova and Vesselin Popov
- By adopting the new language law, Ukraine has implicitly abandoned the idea of returning Crimea
