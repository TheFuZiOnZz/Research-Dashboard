- On 28 January 1915 - 30 October 1918, The Sinai and Palestine campaign was part of the Middle Eastern theatre of World War I. The British Empire, the French Third Republic, and the Kingdom of Italy fought alongside the [[Israel-Palestine Contents Page]] in opposition to the Ottoman Empire, the German Empire, and the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
### 1915 Raid on the Suez Canal
- On 28 January 1915 - 4 February 1915, The Raid on the Suez Canal, took place when a German-led Ottoman Army force advanced from Southern Palestine to attack the British Empire-protected Suez Canal, marking the beginning of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of World War 1.
- On 28 January 1915, Turkish forces were spotted not far from the stationed British forces along the Suez Canal.
    
    > `On 28 January, British aircraft located a Turkish force of up to 4,000 men some eight miles east of Deversoir (in the central sector), which confirmed the British view that the main Turkish attack would fall in the centre, probably in the area between Serapeum (four miles south of Lake Timsah) and El Ferdan (seven miles north of Ismailia). This warning gave the British time to reinforce the trenches on the key sections of the west bank, drawing on reserves which had been assembled close to the canal. British and French warships entered the canal and took up their stations.` [[link]](https://archive.org/details/lastcrusadepales0000bruc/mode/2up?view=theater) - The Last Crusade: The Palestine Campaign in the First World War, Anthony Bruce
    
- On 1 February 1915, the first shots were fired from the British to the Turkish forces.
    
    > `On 1 February, HMS Clio opened fire on enemy units in the desert east of El Ferdan.  
    >   
    > By the beginning of February, some 15,000 Turkish troops had passed along the central Sinai route and arrived in the Ismailia area. They had been served well by their Bedouin guides and not a single Turkish soldier (or animal) lost his life. As elsewhere on the canal, the great majority of the British defending force was entrenched on the west bank, but defensive positions had also been built on the east side. In the central sector, there were five such posts, each manned by two companies of Indian infantry. On the west bank, between Lake Timsah and the Great Bitter Lake, there were twelve posts, each manned by two platoons. Each platoon was responsible for the defence of about 600 yards of canal frontage. These defensive arrangements were supported by a reserve of three companies, based at Serapeum, and two gun batteries.`

- On 3 February 1915, the raid on the Suez Canal begins.
    
    > `The sandstorm continued into the night and only in the early hours of 3 February could the Turkish assault on the canal begin. British troops at an observation post at Tussum provided the first evidence of the final preparations for an enemy attack. At 3.25 a.m., members of the Turkish 25th Division, an Arab unit, passed southeast of the post in the direction of the canal, apparently in relatively good order at this point. Not long after Turkish troops had been observed at Tussum, the British saw the enemy making its first attempt to cross the canal. In the words of the official historian, ‘dark masses were discerned moving slowly down the gullies on the east bank towards the water. Presently these masses were discovered to be pontoons and rafts carried by squads of men.’` [[link]](https://archive.org/details/lastcrusadepales0000bruc/mode/2up?view=theater) - The Last Crusade: The Palestine Campaign in the First World War, Anthony Bruce
    
- The Ottoman Suez Expeditionary Force suffered the loss of some 1,500 men including 716 prisoners and the British had a low casualty rate due to the Turkish attempts of surprising the British failing by being spotted early by HMS Clio.
    
    > `British inaction gave the Turks time to consider their next move. Although they had suffered the loss of some 1,500 men, including 716 taken prisoner, their 10th Division remained unscathed. However, morale had undoubtedly been damaged by the failure of their first operation to make any impact either on the canal or its defences. Nor was there any sign of a popular response to the invasion within Egypt itself, and it was evident that no assistance from that direction could be expected in the future. Without such popular support, the wider objectives of the invasion could not be achieved, given the marked imbalance in strength of the opposing forces. In his account of the Sinai campaign, Kress claimed that  
    >   
    > 'Djemal Pasha had expected that his appearance on the canal would be followed by a rising of the Egyptian nationalists. In this hope he was deceived. There remained, however, an attainable goal, to force his way suddenly astride the canal, hold the crossing for a few days, and in that time close the canal permanently.'  
    >   
    > However, without the element of surprise, even this more limited objective remained beyond the Turkish army’s grasp.`  
    > [[link]](https://archive.org/details/lastcrusadepales0000bruc/mode/2up?view=theater) - The Last Crusade: The Palestine Campaign in the First World War, Anthony Bruce
    
- On 3 February 1915, The Commander-In-Chief of the Ottoman-Turkish Forces in the Syria and Palestine regions orders a retreat of the forces to prevent further casualties.
    
    > `Djemal Pasha, commander-in-chief in Syria and Palestine, had accompanied the invasion force to the canal and it was he who, on 3 February, decided that an orderly withdrawal was all that could now be achieved. Although he had little talent as a soldier, he was realistic enough to recognize that renewing the attack could result in the complete destruction of the Turkish force and a further heavy blow to Turkish prestige. The only consolation for the Turks was the fact that the invasion force had been able to disengage without difficulty and return to its forward base without any interference by the British.` [[link]](https://archive.org/details/lastcrusadepales0000bruc/mode/2up?view=theater) - The Last Crusade: The Palestine Campaign in the First World War, Anthony Bruce
    
- Attempts to minimize the loss of the raid were attempted by the Turks and Germans by trying to redefine the purpose for the raid on the Suez Canal.
    
    > `Later the Turks and their German allies would try to minimize the stated purpose of the expedition, claiming that it was no more than a reconnaissance or an attempt to destroy part of the fabric of the canal. Even if such rationalizations are accepted, the methods employed were hardly equal to the task. For reasons that are not clear they used their weaker division in the attack and kept the stronger 10th Division in reserve. (This latter division was used at no time during the invasion.) Moreover their diversionary actions to the north and south were weak and unconvincing, and failed to draw British troops away from the main expected area of attack. The Turks were thus obliged to face the full strength of the defending forces when they attacked the British centre. The results, according to Yigal Sheffy, a specialist in the history of military intelligence, were fatal to the Turkish cause:  
    >   
    > ”Had Cemal [Djemal Pasha] implemented the principle of force optimization by bringing in the sizeable force available in the rear, invested his better trained troops in the first wave, and pressed the defenders on the flanks, he would have had a much better prospect for securing the east bank opposite Serapeum and establishing a beachhead on the west bank.”  
    >   
    > Given that the capture of the canal was possibly the most valuable contribution it could have made to the cause of its allies, it seems likely that the Turkish army’s half-hearted attack with insignificant numbers had a wider political explanation.`

### 1917 Tel Aviv & Jaffa Deportation
- In March - April 1917, The Tel Aviv and Jaffa deportation was the evacuation of 10,000 people from Jaffa, including Tel Aviv, by the authorities of the Ottoman Empire in Palestine. This was a reaction to the [[Israel-Palestine Contents Page]] & [[Israel-Palestine Contents Page]] Gaza Battles and the Jewish inhabitants possibly assisting the British forces.
- The Commander-In-Chief of the Ottoman-Turkish Forces in the Syria and Palestine regions was possibly concerned about Jewish inhabitants assisting the British forces. The Yishuv organised a crisis committee to help reduce the possible catastrophe with the deportation and has been attributed to reducing the human toll.
    
    > `At the end of March 1917, on the threshold of the Pesach festival, the Jewish community of Tel Aviv and Jaffa was ordered to evacuate their homes. Fully one-fifth of the evacuees perished, owing to the difficult conditions of the transfer. Djemal Pasha justified the order by the threat of British naval attacks on the community. Since no similar orders were issued to Haifa or Beirut, it is probable that he was concerned with the assistance the Jews would offer the already advancing British troops. The vicious and ruthless manner in which the order was carried out exemplify Djemal Pasha’s attitude towards his subjects.  
    >   
    > When the extent of the economic depression and political oppression was realized, a “‘crisis-relief committee’ was formed in Jaffa headed by Meir Dizengoff, the mayor of Tel Aviv. Various emergency measures were taken to relieve the widespread suffering and hunger. Public kitchens were established, all available land was sown for additional food, and the communities of the Galilee and Samaria — which were relatively mildly affected — were asked to share their produce with their less fortunate brethren.  
    >   
    > The committee was also active in minimizing the anguish of the banished foreign nationals. Often family members became separated at the point of departure, and not even the committee’s good offices, contacts, and bribes could influence sadistic officials to permit their reunion. The evacuation of Jaffa and Tel Aviv would have been even more costly in terms of human lives, were it not for the efforts of Dizengoff and his committee who organized the evacuation in an orderly manner.`  
    > [[link]](https://archive.org/details/inshadowofstrugg0000birn/mode/1up?view=theater) - In the shadow of the struggle, Ervin Birnbaum
    
- New Historian Tom Segev wrote a piece for Haaretz in 2009 on the deportation.
    
    > `In the spring of 1917, roads in the south of the country overflowed with tens of thousands of refugees. The Turks who then ruled the land had expelled them from Gaza. It happened after the British had twice failed in their attempts to conquer Gaza. Moshe Smilansky, a farmer and writer who wandered a good deal among the Arabs, saw the waves of refugees and described them in his journal: "All of them bear the mark of hunger, fear and disaster." The disaster was not theirs alone, he wrote: "A terrible panic befell not only the residents of Gaza, but the entire land." Because, he maintained, the authorities intended to resettle some of the Arab refugees in communities belonging to the Jews: "We were very fearful about these guests, because of the overcrowding, lack of cleanliness, and disruption of the usual order. But still we took comfort in this - better that they expel the Arabs to us than that they should expel us to them," Smilansky observed. Little did he know.  
    >   
    > A few weeks later, the residents of Jaffa and Tel Aviv were also forced to leave their homes; some of them found shelter among Arabs.  
    >   
    > Around 50,000 people lived in Jaffa at that time, including some 10,000 Jews; nearly 2,000 Jews lived in the adjacent garden suburb, Tel Aviv. The authorities claimed they had to vacate Jaffa for their own protection. The military governor of the country was Cemal Pasha, one of the leaders of the Young Turk movement, who is also known as the mastermind behind the Armenian genocide. As with the expulsion of the civilian population from Gaza, the authorities claimed that Jaffa's evacuation was necessary to protect the residents, ahead of the British invasion. "You cannot fight for a city to the sound of women screaming and children crying," Cemal Pasha explained.  
    >   
    > A foreign diplomat stationed in Jerusalem at the time offered the view that the authorities were hostile to the Jews of Jaffa and Tel Aviv, and would take advantage of the evacuation to harm the Zionists. He was right: Only a few Jewish youths were given permission to remain in the city to safeguard the houses. All the rest were forced to get out.  
    >   
    > A deathly silence  
    >   
    > The evacuation took about two weeks. It began in an orderly fashion, but rapidly descended into chaos. A local reporter described a confused mob of people, horses and mules, and piles and piles of belongings. Men, women and children were stretched out over their bundles, waiting outside day and night for their turn, until a cart would arrive to collect them. Wagon after wagon departed, numbering in the hundreds: wagons laden with household wares and carpets, heavy furniture and even pianos; wagons full of Torah scrolls from the synagogues; and wagons carrying wheat and other foodstuffs. They left behind them a long trail of animal excrement. Moshe Smilansky saw a baby carriage hitched to a donkey and driven by two children.`

### 1918 Armistice of Mudros
- On 30 October 1918, the Armistice of Mudros ended hostilities in the Middle Eastern theatre between the Ottoman Empire and the Allies of World War I. It was signed by the Ottoman Minister of Marine Affairs Rauf Bey and British Admiral Somerset Arthur Gough-Calthorpe, on board HMS Agamemnon in Mudros harbour on the Greek island of Lemnos.
- The armistice was followed by the occupation of Constantinople (now Istanbul) and the subsequent partitioning of the Ottoman Empire. The Treaty of Sèvres (10 August 1920), which was signed in the aftermath of World War I, imposed harsh terms on the Ottoman Empire, but it was never ratified by the Ottoman Parliament in Istanbul.

### 1917 February Revolution
- Between 8–16 March 1917 (23 February Old Style), The February Revolution was the first of two revolutions which took place in Russia in 1917.
- The main events of the revolution took place in and near Petrograd (present-day Saint Petersburg), the then-capital of Russia, where long-standing discontent with the monarchy erupted into mass protests against food rationing.
    - `The day after Nicholas's departure, disorders broke out in Petrograd. They began with a demonstration on International Woman's Day (February 2 3). The event proceeded peacefully,` ... `On February 24, the situation in the capital deteriorated when up to 200,000 idle workers, either on strike or locked out, filled the streets. On the city's main thoroughfare, Nevsky Prospekt, crowds shouted "Down with the autocracy!" and "Down with the war!" Here and there, mobs sacked food stores. The following day the crowds, emboldened by the lack of a vigorous response, grew still more aggressive. Apparently under the influence of radical intellectuals, the demonstrations now assumed a distinctly political character, with red banners making their appearance bearing evolutionary slogans, some of which read "Down with the German Woman!" In several city quarters, gendarmes came under attack.` [[link]](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/bafykbzacebnsk5n32pgusyhvt6mce5ocih3yxmlhp62d7o5gslwc7sfyrbym2?filename=Richard%20Pipes%20-%20A%20Concise%20History%20of%20the%20Russian%20Revolution-Knopf%20%281995%29.pdf)
- On 15 March (2 March Old Style), Nicholas II agreed Abdicated the throne of the Russian Empire on behalf of himself and his son, Tsarevich Alexei Nikolaevich, in favor of his brother Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich. This led to the establishment of a Democratic `Dual Power` structure of Russia for a brief period between the Provisional Government made from the original official State Duma and the Petrograd Soviet made up of workers councils.
    - `A provisional government under Prince L’vov was nominated by the Duma’s leaders acting as a provisional committee on 14 March. It forced the Tsar to abdicate on behalf of himself and his son in favour of Grand Duke Michael on 15 March (2 March).` [[link]](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafykbzacedoxuu33g44lvbtaigktbw2brodlix4rbnbwmqbyjvl5gp67d2w2o?filename=%28Modern%20Wars%20in%20Perspective%29%20Ian%20F.W.%20Beckett%20-%20The%20Great%20War_%201914-1918-Routledge%20%282007%29.pdf)
- On 16 March (3 March Old Style) the Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich refused to accept the imperial authority, stating that he would accept it only if that was the consensus of democratic action by the Russian Constituent Assembly, which shall define the form of government for Russia.
    - `A heavy burden has been laid upon Me by the will of My Brother, Who has given over to Me the Imperial Throne of All the Russias at a time of unprecedented warfare and popular disturbances. Inspired by the thought, which is shared by all the people, that the good of our native land is above everything else, I have taken a firm decision to assume the Supreme Power only in the event that such is the will of our great people, upon whom it devolves by a general vote, through their representatives in the Constituent Assembly, to determine the form of government and the new fundamental laws of the Russian State.` [[link]](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafykbzacearzlmowbqphrwjchdgmdlm2m7pw2kw46j7rmlvbtmtrbjjiibcgy?filename=Robert%20P.%20Browder_%20Aleksandr%20Fyodorovich%20Kerensky%20-%20The%20Russian%20Provisional%20Government%2C%201917_%20Documents%2C%20Volumes%20I-III-Stanford%20University%20Press%20%281961%29.pdf) [p116]
- The Provisional Government wanted Russia to continue to be involved in World War I, much to the dismay of the Petrograd Soviets.
    - `The February Revolution produced a surge of patriotism and a renewed determination across a wide swathe of society to defend the Revolution against German militarism. This mood was reflected in the Petrograd Soviet’s policy on bringing an end to the war, a policy crafted by the Georgian Menshevik I. Tsereteli, and published as a proclamation ‘To the Peoples of the World’ on 14 March. Although it called for the army to defend the Revolution, its ‘revolutionary defencism’ was more radical than that of the Workers’ Group of the War Industries Committees insofar as its accent was very much on internationalism and on the achievement of a peace without territorial annexations or the imposition of indemnities.` [[link]](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafykbzacecbfl3ivuiasuerahxct4h6qsid2nw6xaaamwpgism4imx7wfbe46?filename=Smith%2C%20Stephen%20Anthony%20-%20Russia%20in%20revolution%20_%20an%20Empire%20in%20crisis%2C%201890%20to%201928-Oxford%20University%20Press%20%282017%29.pdf)
- The Bolsheviks, lead by Lenin, took advantage of the commitment to the war to fuel a future second revolution and recognised the agreement between the the Provisional Government and the Petrograd Soviet.
    - `It should be clear from this why our comrades, too, make so many mistakes when putting the question “simply”: Should the Provisional Government be overthrown immediately? My answer is: (1) it should be overthrown, for it is an oligarchic, bourgeois, and not a people’s government, and is unable to provide peace, bread, or full freedom; (2) It cannot be overthrown just now, for it is being kept in power by a direct and indirect, a formal and actual agreement with the Soviets of Workers’ Deputies, and primarily with the chief Soviet, the Petrograd Soviet; (3) generally, it can not be “overthrown” in the ordinary way, for it rests on the “support” given to the bourgeoisie by the second government—the Soviet of Workers’ Deputies, and that government is the only possible revolutionary government, which directly expresses the mind and will of the majority of the workers and peasants. Humanity has not yet evolved and we do not as yet know a type of government superior to and better than the Soviets of Workers’, Agricultural Labourers’, Peasants’, and Soldiers’ Deputies.` - Lenin [[link]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/apr/09.htm)
### 1917 October Revolution
- On 7 November 1917 (25 October Old Style), The October Revolution was a revolution in Russia led by the Bolshevik Party of Vladimir Lenin. It was the second revolutionary change of government in Russia in 1917. It took place through an armed insurrection in Petrograd (now Saint Petersburg). It was the precipitating event of the Russian Civil War.
- The October Revolution followed and capitalized on the February Revolution earlier that year.
    - `The Bolshevik coup went through two phases. In the first, during which Lenin assumed direct command, the strategy was to replicate the events of February and bring the government down by street demonstrations.` [[link]](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/bafykbzacebnsk5n32pgusyhvt6mce5ocih3yxmlhp62d7o5gslwc7sfyrbym2?filename=Richard%20Pipes%20-%20A%20Concise%20History%20of%20the%20Russian%20Revolution-Knopf%20%281995%29.pdf)
- The left-wing Bolsheviks were deeply unhappy with the government, and began spreading calls for a military uprising. On 23 October 1917 (10 October Old Style), the Petrograd Soviet, led by Trotsky, voted to back a military uprising.
    - `Although Lenin wanted immediate action, he had to yield to the majority of his associates, who preferred that the coup be carried out in the name of the soviets. Since a genuinely elected national congress of soviets was almost certain to yield a Bolshevik minority, Trotsky and his lieutenants proceeded to convene a congress composed mostly of those soviets in which they had assured majorities. Ignoring the protests of the Ispolkom that it alone had the right to convene congresses of soviets, they created a spurious "Northern Regional Committee" composed of eleven Bolsheviks and six Left SRs (a splinter from the SR Party, temporarily affiliated with them). This committee, arrogating itself the authority of the Ispolkom, invited soviets and military committees to send delegates to the forthcoming Congress.` [[link]](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/bafykbzacebnsk5n32pgusyhvt6mce5ocih3yxmlhp62d7o5gslwc7sfyrbym2?filename=Richard%20Pipes%20-%20A%20Concise%20History%20of%20the%20Russian%20Revolution-Knopf%20%281995%29.pdf)
- On 6 November 1917 (24 October Old Style), the government shut down numerous newspapers and closed the city of Petrograd in an attempt to forestall the revolution; minor armed skirmishes broke out.
    - `Although signed by Lenin, it was actually drafted by Anatolii Lunacharskii, the Commissar of Enlightenment. It called for the shutting down of the "counterrevolutionary" press, by which were meant all newspapers that refused to acknowledge the legitimacy of the October coup-in effect, the entire press except for the organs of the Bolsheviks and Left SRs` [[link]](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/bafykbzacebnsk5n32pgusyhvt6mce5ocih3yxmlhp62d7o5gslwc7sfyrbym2?filename=Richard%20Pipes%20-%20A%20Concise%20History%20of%20the%20Russian%20Revolution-Knopf%20%281995%29.pdf)
- The next day a full scale uprising erupted as a fleet of Bolshevik sailors entered the harbor and tens of thousands of soldiers rose up in support of the Bolsheviks. Bolshevik Red Guards forces under the Military-Revolutionary Committee began the occupation of government buildings on 25 October (O.S.; 7 November, N.S.), 1917. The following day, the Winter Palace (the seat of the Provisional government located in Petrograd, then capital of Russia) was captured.
    - `That night (October 24-25), Bolshevik units methodically took control of the key points in the city by the simple procedure of posting pickets. Junker guards, told to retire, either withdrew voluntarily or were disarmed. Thus, under cover of darkness, the Milrevkom occupied, one by one, railroad stations, postal, telephone and telegraph offices, banks, and bridges. No resistance was encountered, no shots exchanged.` [[link]](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/bafykbzacebnsk5n32pgusyhvt6mce5ocih3yxmlhp62d7o5gslwc7sfyrbym2?filename=Richard%20Pipes%20-%20A%20Concise%20History%20of%20the%20Russian%20Revolution-Knopf%20%281995%29.pdf)
    - `The cabinet that Lenin had declared deposed sat in the Malachite Room of the Winter Palace awaiting help.

- As the Revolution was not universally recognized, the country descended into the Russian Civil War, which would last until 1923 and ultimately lead to the [creation of the Soviet Union](https://www.notion.so/27b787c817dd4ec6b105f068c07e9c03?pvs=21) in late 1922.
### 1918 Treaty of Brest-Litovsk
- On 3 March 1918, The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk [[link]](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/bl34.asp\#treatytext) (also known as the Treaty of Brest in Russia) was a separate peace treaty signed between the new Bolshevik government of Russia, headed my Lenin, and the Central Powers (German Empire, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, and the Ottoman Empire), that ended Russia's participation in World War I.
- The treaty also signed over areas of the former Russian Empire
    - `The terms of the Brest-Litovsk Treaty, which the Russians signed on March 3, were extremely burdensome. They give an idea of what the Allies would have faced had they lost the war. Russia had to make major territorial concessions which deprived her of the conquests made in the west since the middle of the seventeenth century. She had to give lip Poland, Finland, and the Ukraine, as well as Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and Transcaucasia.` [[link]](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/bafykbzacebnsk5n32pgusyhvt6mce5ocih3yxmlhp62d7o5gslwc7sfyrbym2?filename=Richard%20Pipes%20-%20A%20Concise%20History%20of%20the%20Russian%20Revolution-Knopf%20%281995%29.pdf)
    - `Lenin has been widely credited with prophetic vision in accepting a humiliating treaty which gave him the time he needed to organize his government, and which collapsed of its own weight once Germany surrendered to the Allies on November 11, 1918. When the Bolsheviks renounced the Brest-Litovsk Treaty two days later, Lenin's stock in Bolshevik ranks rose to unprecedented heights. Nothing he had done contributed more to his reputation for infallibility; he never again had to threaten resignation to have his way.` [[link]](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/bafykbzacebnsk5n32pgusyhvt6mce5ocih3yxmlhp62d7o5gslwc7sfyrbym2?filename=Richard%20Pipes%20-%20A%20Concise%20History%20of%20the%20Russian%20Revolution-Knopf%20%281995%29.pdf)
- The motivations of this treaty has been renounced to be what the future actions the Soviet Union’s Foreign Policy would be.
    - `The circumstances surrounding the Brest-Litovsk Treaty furnish the classic model of what was to become Soviet foreign policy for the next seventy years. Its principles may be summarized as follows:  
          
        I. The highest priority at all times is to be assigned to the retention of political power-that is, sovereign authority and control of the state apparatus over some part-no matter how small-of one's national territory. This is the irreducible minimum. No price is too high to secure it; for its sake anything and everything can be sacrificed: human lives, land and resources, national honor. The premise behind this principle is that time works for communism, for which reason whatever is given up today will be regained tomorrow.  
          
        2. Ever since Russia underwent the October Revolution, which turned her into the focal point of world socialism, her security and interests have taken precedence over the security and interests of any other country, cause, or party, including those of the "international proletariat."  
          
        3. To purchase temporary advantages, it is permissible to make peace with "imperialist" countries, but such peace must be treated as an armed truce, to be broken when the situation changes in one's favor. History teaches, Lenin said in arguing for the ratification of the Brest-Litovsk Treaty, that peace is nothing but "a breathing spell for war." As long as capitalism exists, he declared in May I9I8, international agreements are but "scraps of paper." Even in periods of nominal peace, hostilities  
        should be pursued by covert means to undermine governments with which one has signed peace agreements.  
          
        4· Politics being warfare, foreign policy must always be conducted unemotionally, with the closest attention being paid to the correlation of forces. In Lenin's words:  
        We have great revolutionary experience, and from that experience we have learned that it is necessary to follow the tactics of relentless advance whenever objective conditions allow it ... But we have to adopt the tactic of procrastination, the slow gathering of forces when the objective conditions do not offer the possibility of making an appeal to the general relentless advance.  
          
        Yet another fundamental principle of Bolshevik foreign policy was to be revealed after the signing of the Brest-Litovsk Treaty: the principle that Bolshevik interests abroad (as at home) had to be promoted by the application of the "divide and rule" principle: the most circumspect, careful, cautious, skillful exploitation of-every, even the smallest "crack" among one's enemies, of every conflict of interest among the bourgeoisie of the various countries, among the various groupings or species of the bourgeoisie within individual countries`

### 1918 Execution of the Russian Monarchy
- On 16-17 July 1918,The Russian Imperial Romanov family were shot and bayoneted to death by Bolshevik revolutionaries under Yakov Yurovsky on the orders of the Ural Regional Soviet in Yekaterinburg. Also murdered that night were members of the imperial entourage who had accompanied them: court physician Eugene Botkin; lady-in-waiting Anna Demidova; footman Alexei Trupp; and head cook Ivan Kharitonov. The bodies were taken to the Koptyaki forest, where they were stripped, buried, and mutilated to prevent identification.
    - `The Imperial family spent July 16 in their customary manner. Judging by the last entry in Alexandra's diary, written at 11 p.m. as the. family retired for the night, they had no premonition of what was about to happen. They were awakened at 1:30 a.m. and told that in view of the unrest in the city and occasional random shooting, they would be removed to the basement. At 2 a.m. under heavy guard, the seven Romanovs, their physician, lady-in-waiting, and two servants descended to the lower floor. A short time later, the commandant of the house, a Chekist by the name of Iakov Iurovskii, entered the crowded room accompanied by a squad of armed guards. From his recently discovered recollections of the event, this is what ensued:  
          
        When the party entered, [I] told the Romanovs that in view of the fact that their relatives continued their offensive against Soviet Russia, the Executive Committee of the Ural Soviet had decided to shoot them. Nicholas turned his back to the detachment and faced his family. Then, as if collecting himself, he turned around, asking "What? What?" [I] rapidly repeated what I had said and ordered the detachment to get ready. Its members had been previously instructed whom to shoot and to aim directly at the heart to avoid much blood and finish more quickly. Nicholas said nothing more. He turned again toward his family. The others shouted some incoherent exclamations. All this lasted a few seconds. Then commenced the shooting which lasted for two or three minutes. [I] killed Nicholas on the spot.  
          
        The young Alexis, who lay on the floor in a pool of blood but still breathing, was dispatched by Iurovskii with two shots in the head. The whole "procedure," as Iurovskii calls it, took twenty minutes. The bodies were carried to a truck and taken out of town to a place previously chosen for the purpose. There they were stripped. It was discovered that three of the girls had sewn into their corsets large quantities of diamonds; Iurovskii had considerable difficulty preventing the executioners from stealing them. The bodies were soaked with sulfuric acid and kerosene, and then burned. The remains were buried in a shallow grave that was not discovered until 1989.`

Located on Kotlin Island in the Gulf of Finland, Kronstadt defended the former capital city, Petrograd (now Saint Petersburg), as the base of the Baltic Fleet. For sixteen days in March 1921, rebels in Kronstadt's naval fortress rose in opposition to the Soviet government they had helped to consolidate. Led by Stepan Petrichenko, it was the last major revolt against Bolshevik rule on Russian territory during the Russian Civil War.

- - `` [link]
### 1922 Creation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics
- On 29 December 1922, The Declaration and Treaty on the Formation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics officially created the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), commonly known as the Soviet Union. It de jure legalised a political union of several Soviet republics that had existed since 1919 and created a new federal government whose key functions were centralised in Moscow.
- Its legislative branch consisted of the Congress of Soviets of the Soviet Union and the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union (TsIK), while the Council of People's Commissars composed the executive.
- The Treaty, along with the Declaration of the Creation of the USSR was approved on 30 December 1922 by a conference of delegations from the Russian SFSR, the Transcaucasian SFSR, the Ukrainian SSR and the Byelorussian SSR.
- Following the declaration, is the treaty itself consisting of a preface and 26 articles. In the preface it is fixed that the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, the Ukrainian Socialist Soviet Republic, the Byelorussian Socialist Soviet Republic and the Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic (containing Georgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia) acting in free will, agree to form a single Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, that is governed on articles listed in the treaty.
    - Article 1 lists the competency of the responsibilities that the Union's authorities would contain. These include all foreign affairs; international treaties; change in external borders; expansion of the Union by accepting new republics; declaring war and agreeing to peace; foreign and domestic trade; authority over economic development; creating unified postal and transport services; the armed forces; internal migration; creation of single judiciary, education and healthcare services as well as unifying all units of measurement. All of the above would be thus explicitly controlled directly by the Union's authority. Moreover, the final clause explicitly listed, that the Union's authorities could now overturn acts of all Republics' authorities (be it Congresses of Soviets, Soviets of People's Commissars or Central Executive Committees) that were deemed in violation with regard to this Treaty.
    - Articles 2–10 determined the structure of supreme authorities of the Union. The legislative authority, according to the treaty, was the Congress of Soviets of the Soviet Union and between the congresses, this was to be carried out by the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union (TsIK)
    - (2). The delegates to the Congress are to be elected by local Soviets represented by one elected representative from 25,000 voters in urban areas and one per 125,000 voters in rural areas
    - (3). The Congress delegates would be elected by local Guberniya Soviets, rather than Republican ones
    - (4). The congresses would be held annually or may be summoned by requests of at least two Republics' or the Union's TsIK
    - (5). The TsIK would be the main body to carry out executive functions between the congresses. This TsiK was a 371-person body, whose members were proportionally represented to the population of the Union, and elected by the Congress
    - (6). The Union TsIK would meet four times per annum on a regular basis, whilst irregular sessions can be summoned on demand by the Union government (the Council of People's Commissars) or by one of the constituent Republics
    - (7). The Congress and the TsIK would be held in the capitals of the Union Republics in the order that would be decided by TsIK's Presidium
    - (8). The latter was to be appointed by TsIK, that would be the supreme power organ between its sessions
    - (9). This Presidium would consist of nineteen members, with four chairmen, each representing the four republics
    - (10). The Presidium also had the authority to summon an irregular session of TsIK.
    - Article 11 appointed the executive authority, the Council of People's Commissars (SNK). The council's members were appointed by TsIK, and included ten portfolios (commissariats) as well as a chairmen and his deputies.
    - Article 12 specified the functions of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union (under control of TsIK) and the secret police, the OGPU (under control of the SNK, and the OGPU chairman was to be a participant of the SNK with advisory vote). The creation of these two bodies was justified as measures to overcome criminal and counter-revolutionary elements in that very article.
    - Articles 13–17 specified the framework on the legal proceedings between the Union's supreme bodies (the TsIK and the SNK) and those of each republic. All of the decrees by Union's SNK were effective in every republic (13). Also confirmed, was the multilingual aspect of the Union, specifying that all of the Union's decrees are to printed in the official language of each constituent republic (Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, Georgian, Armenian and Turkic (i.e. Azerbaijani)) (14). It was specified that the Union's SNK resolution may only be overruled by the Union's TsIK or its Presidium (16), and if a republican TsIK chooses to protest the resolution or a decree of the Union's TsIK, the protest itself does not halt the implementation of the document (15). The latter is only possible if there are obvious violations with existing laws, and in such cases, the republic must immediately notify the Union's SNK and the relevant commissariat (17).
    - Article 18 listed the authorities that would be retained by the Republics[example needed] and specified their respective Councils of People's Commissars, each to have a chairman, his deputies, eleven portfolios and representatives with advisory votes of several Union-level commissariats, in particular foreign affairs, defence, foreign trade, transport and logistics.
    - At the same time article 19 specified that republican-level organs, the Supreme Soviet of the National Economy (whose chairman was to also have a full seat in the relevant republican SNK), the commissariats for food supply, finance and labour, as well as the Soviet inspection (the Rabkrin) though subjugated to the Republican authorities, their activities were to be regulated by the Union's TsIK.
    - Article 20 discussed that the budgets of the Republics would form the Union's budget and that all expenses and spendings by the Republics would be determined by the Union's TsIK. Moreover, the latter would also determine the share of profits, if any, that each Republic would receive.
    - Articles 21–23 created a single Soviet citizenship (21), state symbolism (flag, national anthem and a coat of arms – 22), and specified the Union's capital in Moscow (23).
    - Article 24 demanded that the republics amended their constitutions with regard to the treaty.
    - Article 25 specified that any amendments, additions or changes to the treaty may be done only by the Union's Congress of Soviets.
    - Article 26 affirmed the clause in the declaration where each republic has the right to leave the Union.

- [[link]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%E2%80%93Crane_Commission)
- The King–Crane Commission, officially called the 1919 Inter-Allied Commission on Mandates in Turkey, was a commission of inquiry concerning the disposition of areas within the former Ottoman Empire. The Commission began as an outgrowth of the 1919 Paris Peace Conference. The Commission visited areas of Palestine, Syria, Lebanon, and Anatolia, surveyed local public opinion, and assessed its view on the best course of action for the region.
- Originally meant to be led by French, British, Italian and American representatives, it ended as an investigation conducted solely by the United States government after the other countries withdrew to avoid the risk of being "confronted by recommendations from their own appointed delegates which might conflict with their policies". With the withdrawal of other allied nations, the commission lost any real credibility.

    > `On the occasion of the signature of the Nonaggression Pact between the German Reich and the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics the undersigned plenipotentiaries of each of the two parties discussed in strictly confidential conversations the question of the boundary of their respective spheres of influence in Eastern Europe. These conversations led to the following conclusions:  
    >   
    > 1. In the event of a territorial and political rearrangement in the areas belonging to the Baltic States (Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania), the northern boundary of Lithuania shall represent the boundary of the spheres of influence of Germany and the U.S.S.R. In this connection the interest of Lithuania in the Vilna area is recognized by each party.

- Stalin was aware months before the Pact was signed of Hitler’s intentions with Poland.
    
    > `Stalin was in a difficult position in 1939. Over the previous few years he had carried out violent purges of his top generals, munitions factory managers and senior army officers. There were few left in the higher echelons of the regime with any direct experience of warfare. Competent technical experts had been arrested and killed in their thousands. Soviet military preparedness was lamentable. Stalin was aware from June 1939 onwards of Hitler's intention to invade Poland in late August or early September. More than anything else, he needed to ensure that the invasion went no further. He needed time to regroup and rebuild the Red Army, refashion his arms and equipment production, and get ready for the assault he was sure would follow some time after the German conquest of Poland. To some extent, he left open the option of forging an alliance with the Western powers; but they were hesitant, regarding him as unreliable, and Ribbentrop and the German Foreign Office were eager, despite Hitler's own personal reservations. As the hints from Moscow grew stronger, Ribbentrop saw an opportunity to shock the British, whom he still hated intensely after the humiliations of his time as ambassador in London, and deliver a coup that would win Hitler's undying gratitude and approval.` [link] - The Third Reich in Power, 1933-1939: How the Nazis Won Over the Hearts and Minds of a Nation, Richard Evans
    
- On 28 September 1939, after the Nazi & Soviet Invasion of Poland, The `German–Soviet Boundary and Friendship Treaty` [[link]](http://www.ibiblio.org/pha/nsr/nsr-03.html\#32) was a second supplementary protocol of the Pact that was modified giving the Nazi’s a bigger part of Poland, while giving most of Lithuania to the Soviets.
    
    > `Eleven days later, the arrangement under the secret protocols was modified. Germany was allotted a larger part of Poland, while most of Lithuania was added to Moscow's "sphere of influence." Leaving all of central Poland to the Germans, Stalin gave credence to his claim that he simply wanted to recuperate previous territory up to the "Curzon line", which was alleged to be Russia's "ethnic frontier."` [[link]](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafykbzaced4ims4h6i4i4ghuont2geechnvrmxxuhgekzpo34ph45njuzb7t4?filename=%28Harvard%20Cold%20War%20Studies%29%20Gerhard%20Wettig%20-%20Stalin%20and%20the%20Cold%20War%20in%20Europe_%20The%20Emergence%20and%20Development%20of%20East-West%20Conflict%2C%201939-1953-Rowman%20%26%20Littlefield%20Publishers%20%282007%29.pdf)

- [[link]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_invasion_of_Poland)
- On September 1st 1939, Nazi Germany invades Poland, inciting Poland’s allies Britain and France to declare war on Germany.
- On September 17th 1939, under the auspices of the [Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact](https://www.notion.so/27b787c817dd4ec6b105f068c07e9c03?pvs=21), Soviet leader Joseph Stalin orders the invasion of Poland, securing a share of Polish territory.
- The campaign ended on 6 October with Germany and the Soviet Union dividing and annexing the whole of Poland under the terms of the supplementary protocol of the [Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact](https://www.notion.so/27b787c817dd4ec6b105f068c07e9c03?pvs=21) called the `German–Soviet Boundary and Friendship Treaty`.
- Polish losses included 3,000–7,000 killed or missing with up to 20,000 wounded. Soviet losses included 1,475–3,000 killed or missing with 2,383–10,000 wounded.
    
    > `Molotov admitted to the Supreme Soviet on 31 October that the 'liberation' of eastern Poland had cost the Red Army 737 killed and 1862 wounded. Polish specialists claim up to 3000 killed and 8000-10000 wounded as well as the destruction of 100 Soviet tanks and armoured cars. Polish military deaths are variously estimated at between 3000 and 7000, with 20000 wounded. An additional thousand to 2500 were executed or murdered in immediate reprisals by both Soviet and harassing Ukrainian nationalist forces.` [[link]](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafykbzaceb246lkh7efv5wypd3qojdxndtxluifuuhlnbohko74y76k2exsv6?filename=George%20Sanford%20-%20Katyn%20and%20the%20Soviet%20Massacre%20of%201940_%20Truth%2C%20Justice%20and%20Memory%20%28BASEES%20Routledge%20Series%20on%20Russian%20and%20East%20European%20Studies%29%20%20-Routledge%20%282005%29.pdf)

- In November 30 1939, under the auspices of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, the Soviet Union invaded Finland.
- The Finnish defensive effort defied Soviet expectations, and after stiff losses, as well as the unsuccessful attempt to install a puppet government in Helsinki, Stalin settled for an interim peace granting the Soviet Union parts of Karelia and Salla (9% of Finnish territory).
    - `` [link]
- Soviet official casualty counts in the war exceeded 200,000, while Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev later claimed the casualties may have been one million.

- On December 14 1939, The Soviet Union is expelled from the League of Nations in response to the Soviet invasion of Finland.
    - `The lawless character of the achievement was perceived in nearly every foreign quarter. Russia's contempt for its numerous and well-defined treaty obligations towards its victim, as well as towards the League of Nations, was duly appraised and speedily condemned at Geneva.` ... `2. See Report of the Assembly, provided for in Art. 15, paragraphs 4 and 10, of the Covenant, submitted by the Special Committee of the Assembly, Dec. 13, 1939, League of Nations Official Journal, November-December, 1939, p. 531; also resolution adopted by the Council, Dec. 14, 1939, finding that by its act the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics had "placed itself outside the League of Nations," and declaring that it followed that that country was "no longer a member of the League."

## 1940-44 Soviet, Then Nazi, Then Soviet Occupation of the Baltic States
- On 15 & 16 June 1940, under the auspices of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, The Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were extorted with having military bases on their territories, then later invaded and occupied by the Soviet Union.
    
    > `The independent functioning of the Baltic States was interrupted in June 1940 when, after the conclusion of the Treaty of Non-Aggression between Germany and the USSR of 23 August 1939 (Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact) and its Secret Additional Protocols, Soviet troops occupied the territories of the Baltic States.` [[link]](https://sci-hub.ee/10.1163/221158903x00072)
    
    > `The experience of the first year of Soviet occupation saw Russians replace Baltic Germans and Poles as the most feared and disliked minority in the region. The pattern of takeover was similar in all three states. The first Soviet occupation followed the 23 August 1939 signing of the secret protocols of the Molotov–Ribbentrop pact, which sliced Eastern Europe into two spheres of influence. Estonia, Latvia and eventually Lithuania fell into the Soviet sphere. The Soviet Union then claimed to be threatened by the Baltic states, demanded that ‘mutual assistance agreements’ be signed, and then moved troops and political advisors into the three states (25,000 each in Estonia and Latvia). This was followed in 1940 by Soviet claims that the terms of the treaties had been broken, leading to more troops crossing the borders, to the forced dismissal of the acting cabinets and to new, hand-picked Soviet governments. As Soviet officials took hold of the region, each Baltic state held visibly falsified elections, followed by the coming to power of Soviet-friendly puppet governments. In August 1940 the newly elected Baltic legislatures sent delegates to Moscow to successfully apply for membership in the Soviet Union.` [[link]](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/bafykbzaceay4daq6ol2nc5jsm52fmjzxyptudoad3thqdqcd3rbmqc6k43bya?filename=Daunis%20Auers%20-%20Comparative%20Politics%20and%20Government%20of%20the%20Baltic%20States_%20Estonia%2C%20Latvia%20and%20Lithuania%20in%20the%2021st%20Century-Palgrave%20Macmillan%20UK%20%282015%29.pdf)
    
- On 3-6 August 1940, after planning an installation of a pro-soviet puppet government in the Baltic States and ultimatums from the Soviets to the Baltic States, The three countries were then annexed into the Soviet Union as constituent republics.
    
    > `More sinister intentions are, however, suggested by evidence from the archives of the former government of Latvia which have recently been opened to Latvian scholars. It now appears that as early as December 1939 the Soviets were hoping to be able to take control of Latvia by exploiting left-wing and bourgeois elements in a pretence of a popular front government. The model was the puppet government set up at Terijoki under the Finnish communist Otto Kuusinen on 30 November 1939, the day that the Red Army invaded Finland.` [[link]](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafykbzacedbyqrfvngivgnrqouegkxo2y7uct5shvoev2nda4agooeuiyw2lg?filename=Hiden%20John_%20Salmon%20Patrick%20-%20The%20Baltic%20nations%20and%20Europe_%20Estonia%2C%20Latvia%20and%20Lithuania%20in%20the%20twentieth%20century-Longman%20%281994%29.pdf)
    
    > `On 18 July ‘demonstrators’ in the major cities of the Baltic states called for their incorporation in the Soviet Union: three days later all three parliaments declared their countries Soviet republics and applied for membership. The formal incorporation of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia followed between 3 and 6 August 1940.` [[link]](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafykbzacedbyqrfvngivgnrqouegkxo2y7uct5shvoev2nda4agooeuiyw2lg?filename=Hiden%20John_%20Salmon%20Patrick%20-%20The%20Baltic%20nations%20and%20Europe_%20Estonia%2C%20Latvia%20and%20Lithuania%20in%20the%20twentieth%20century-Longman%20%281994%29.pdf)
    
- On 22 June 1941, following Operation Barbarossa, the Nazi Germany attacked the Soviet Union and within weeks occupied the Baltic territories and by July 1941, the Third Reich occupied the Baltic territory.
    
    > `In such circumstances it is not surprising that many members of the majority populations of the Baltic countries welcomed the German armed forces when they crossed the frontiers of Lithuania on 22 June 1941 and pressed on into Latvia and Estonia. Since signing the Nazi—Soviet pact the Third Reich had displayed a conspicuous lack of concern for the fate of the three republics. In the autumn of 1939 it initiated the evacuation of the Baltic German populations of Estonia and Latvia, thus bringing to an end 700 years of Baltic German history.` [[link]](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafykbzacedbyqrfvngivgnrqouegkxo2y7uct5shvoev2nda4agooeuiyw2lg?filename=Hiden%20John_%20Salmon%20Patrick%20-%20The%20Baltic%20nations%20and%20Europe_%20Estonia%2C%20Latvia%20and%20Lithuania%20in%20the%20twentieth%20century-Longman%20%281994%29.pdf)
    
- On 5 August 1944, the Soviet Union recaptured most of the Baltic states and they, again, were reorganized into constituent republics of the USSR.

    > Latvia - `The annexation of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania is fundamentally illegal: it is based on intervention and occupation. That is why the annexation did not elicit juridical consequences. There was no change of sovereign power: the annexed state retained its sovereignty which the annexing state did not acquire. The status of the Baltic States as subjects of international law did not disappear. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania continued to exist de jure and their existence was recognized by 50 countries throughout the world. The non-recognition of the annexation was very important for the Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian nations. It served as the basis for their unceasing demand for the restoration of the independence of their countries.` [[link]](https://web.archive.org/web/20071123015238/http://www.am.gov.lv/en/latvia/history/occupation-aspects/)
    
    > Estonia - `On 22 September 1944, units of the Red Army captured Tallinn. Although it was a milestone on the road to Allied victory in Europe, the recapture of Tallinn by Soviet forces was far from being a "liberation" for the Estonian people. It merely marked a change in foreign regimes and the beginning of a nightmarishly repressive occupation that would last for nearly 50 more years. The occupation was never recognized by most Western countries. For Estonia, World War II only ended, de facto, on 31 August 1994, with the final withdrawal of former Soviet troops from Estonian soil.` [[link]](https://web.archive.org/web/20080723194014/http://www.estemb.org/estonia/history/aid-775)
    
    > United States - `From Sumner Wells' declaration of July 23, 1940, that we would not recognize the occupation. We housed the exiled Baltic diplomatic delegations. We accredited their diplomats. We flew their flags in the State Department's Hall of Flags.

    > European Parliament - `In the Spring of 1990, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia declared their independence. By the end of the year, all the Republics of the Soviet Union had followed their example. Although the Member States of the Community, along with the majority of Western states, have always refused to recognize the annexation of the Baltic states, they reacted with great caution to the heightening of tension with the central authorities. In the first phase, the Twelve limited themselves to inviting the Soviet authorities to refrain from any act of intimidation, inconformity with Soviet commitments under the Helsinki Final Act and the Charter of Paris. They were also urged to open negotiations with elected representatives of the Baltic Republics ‘in order to meet, through a peaceful solution, the legitimate aspirations of the Baltic peoples’. A similar invitation was made in a letter from the President of the Council, Luxembourg Foreign Minister Poos, to Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze to condemn the use of force by Soviet troops in Vilnius.` [[link]](https://sci-hub.ee/10.1093/oxfordjournals.ejil.a035821)
    
    > European Court of Human Rights - `The Court notes, first, that Estonia lost its independence as a result of the Treaty of Non-Aggression between Germany and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (also known as "Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact"), concluded on 23 August 1939, and the secret additional protocols to it. Following an ultimatum to set up Soviet military bases in Estonia in 1939, a large-scale entry of the Soviet army into Estonia took place in June 1940. The lawful government of the country was overthrown and Soviet rule was imposed by force. The totalitarian communist regime of the Soviet Union conducted large-scale and systematic actions against the Estonian population, including, for example, the deportation of about 10,000 persons on 14 June 1941 and of more than 20,000 on 25 March 1949. After the Second World War, tens of thousands of persons went into hiding in the forests to avoid repression by the Soviet authorities; part of those in hiding actively resisted the occupation regime. According to the data of the security organs, about 1,500 persons were killed and almost 10,000 arrested in the course of the resistance movement of 1944–1953. Interrupted by the German occupation in 1941–1944, Estonia remained occupied by the Soviet Union until its restoration of independence in 1991. Accordingly, Estonia as a state was temporarily prevented from fulfilling its international commitments.` [[link]](https://www.stradalex.com/fr/sl_src_publ_jur_int/document/echr_23052-04_001-72404)

"Published documents, kept in classified archives for many years, not only revealed the scale of this horrific tragedy, but also showed that the Katyn crime was carried out on direct orders of Stalin and other Soviet officials," the declaration read,` [[link]](https://www.rferl.org/a/after-80-years-the-katyn-lie-lives-on-in-russia/30470317.html)

- The Tripartite Pact, also known as the Berlin Pact, was an agreement between Germany, Italy, and Japan signed in Berlin on 27 September 1940 by, respectively, Joachim von Ribbentrop, Galeazzo Ciano and Saburō Kurusu. It was a defensive military alliance that was eventually joined by Hungary (20 November 1940), Romania (23 November 1940), Bulgaria (1 March 1941) and Yugoslavia (25 March 1941) as well as by the German client state of Slovakia (24 November 1940).

## 1941 Invasion of the Soviet Union, Operation Barbarossa
- Operation Barbarossa was the invasion of the Soviet Union by Nazi Germany and most of the Axis leaders, starting on 22 June 1941 which made the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact then unofficially terminated and then officially terminated on 30 July 1941 in the Sikorski–Mayski Agreement.
- Stalin was caught off but this invasion by the Nazis and thought reports from Soviet agents warning him of a potential invasion were the Nazi’s hard-balling for more economic concessions.
    
    > `For all its multinational trimmings, therefore, ‘Operation Barbarossa’ was thus in essence to be a German operation. As the winter snows of East-Central Europe melted and the ground thawed, the German armed forces began moving vast masses of men and equipment up to the Soviet border. Throughout May and early June 1941, Zygmunt Klukowski recorded endless columns of German troops and vehicles passing through his region of Poland, noting the passage of between 500 and 600 vehicles on 14 June alone, for example. Stalin hurriedly launched a futile policy of trying to appease the Germans by stepping up Soviet deliveries of Asian rubber and other supplies under the trade agreement signed in January 1941. As a dogmatic Marxist-Leninist, Stalin was convinced that Hitler’s regime was the tool of German monopoly capitalism, so that if he made available everything German business wanted, there would be no immediate reason to invade. Already, under trade provisions agreed under the Nazi-Soviet Pact early the previous year, the Soviet Union was supplying nearly threequarters of Germany’s requirement of phosphates, over two-thirds of its imported asbestos, only a little less of its chrome ore, over half its manganese, over a third of its imported nickel, and, even more crucially, more than a third of its imported oil. Stalin personally vetoed proposals to disrupt the German military build-up by attacking across the Polish demarcation line. Reports from Soviet agents and even from members of the German embassy in Moscow that an invasion was imminent only convinced him that the Germans were playing hard-ball in their drive to extract economic concessions from him.` [link] - The Third Reich at war, Richard Evans
    
- Stalin’s trust in Soviet intelligence agents was low because of the relaying of correct Nazi planned dates that were delayed, and Stalin interpreting that as people pushing him towards preemptive war with Germany and when informed by a deserted Nazi soldier of the what became the true date of the invasion, Stalin had him shot for spreading disinformation.
    
    > `At the same time, Stalin realized that, as he told graduating military cadets in Moscow on 5 May 1941, ‘War with Germany is inevitable.’ Molotov might be able to postpone it for two or three months, but in the meantime it was vital to ‘re-teach our army and our commanders. Educate them in the spirit of attack.’ Delivered to young officers as a rhetorical message for the future, this was not a statement of intent. Stalin did not believe that the Red Army would be ready to deal with the Germans until 1942 or perhaps even 1943. Not only had the General Staff not drawn up any plans for an attack on the German forces, it had no plans for a defence against them either. Although the Germans mounted a large and sophisticated deception plan to conceal the true nature of their intentions, Soviet intelligence began to send in accurate reports that the invasion was planned for around 22 June 1941. But Stalin would not listen. Earlier reports that the invasion plans were to become operational on 15 May 1941, though correct at the time, proved wrong when the Germans delayed Barbarossa in order to mount the invasion of Greece and Yugoslavia. Hitler later blamed Mussolini for the consequences, but in fact the weather in East-Central Europe in these weeks would have made an invasion of the Soviet Union inadvisable even had the German Leader not been obliged to step in to rescue his Italian ally from the imbroglio in Southern Europe. The Soviet agents who had made the prediction lost all credibility as a result. The capitalist forces in Britain, including the exiled Polish government, seemed to Stalin’s narrow and suspicious mind to be feeding false information to him about German intentions in order to lure him into a battle. Surely in any case the German Leader would not invade while the conflict with Britain was still unresolved. When an ex-Communist soldier deserted the German forces on 21 June 1941 and swam across a river to tell the Russians on the other side that his unit had been given orders to invade the following morning, Stalin had him shot for spreading ‘disinformation’.` [link] - The Third Reich at war, Richard Evans
    
- The Red Army had little time to correct its numerous deficiencies before Nazi Germany and other Axis countries allied with it swept across the newly relocated Soviet border on June 22, 1941, in the opening stages of Operation Barbarossa.
    
    > `The twenty-second of June 1941 is one of the most significant days in the history of Europe. The German invasion of the Soviet Union that began that day under the cryptonym Operation Barbarossa was much more than a surprise attack, a shift of alliances, or a new stage in a war. It was the beginning of a calamity that defies description. The engagement of the Wehrmacht (and its allies) with the Red Army killed more than ten million soldiers, not to speak of the comparable number of civilians who died in flight, under bombs, or of hunger and disease as a result of the war on the eastern front` [[link]](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafykbzaceccblw5ub3z5dqoqr5pbwybapejk3bv2ppkfsemkk7ooi7lhrjfcm?filename=Timothy+Snyder+-+Bloodlands_+Europe+between+Hitler+and+Stalin-Basic+Books+%282010%29.pdf) - Bloodlands: Europe between Hitler and Stalin, Timothy Snyder
    
- Hitler thought Stalin was the safer option to side with compared to the Polish.
    
    > `Hitler himself later explained his failure to conclude a new nonaggression pact with Poland by his lack of confidence in the Poles. They were within striking distance of vital industrial areas in eastern Germany and Bohemia, and he believed they would take the first possible opportunity to stab Germany in the back. Stalin, who in Hitlers opinion could not risk a war under any circumstances, was in that respect a safer treaty partner, as well as being several hundred kilometers farther removed from the German border. Once Hitler had convinced himself he could not rely on Poland, he evidently decided Poland would have to eliminated before he took action against the West. Just when he made the decision to attack Poland, however, is difficult to determine.` [[link]](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/bafykbzacebi7fvuwrky3v3ggchh6zwcupwfb6on22zaennjlbo3loolhsl5yy?filename=%28Hitler%27s%20War%20Aims%29%20Norman%20Rich%20-%20Hitler%27s%20War%20Aims_%20Ideology%2C%20the%20Nazi%20State%2C%20and%20the%20Course%20of%20Expansion-W.%20W.%20Norton%20%20Company%20%281992%29.pdf) - Hitler's war aims, Norman Rich
    
- Hitler expected the Operation to not take as much time as it did.

Yet while the Red Army fell back, it did not collapse.` [[link]](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/bafykbzaceccblw5ub3z5dqoqr5pbwybapejk3bv2ppkfsemkk7ooi7lhrjfcm?filename=Timothy%20Snyder%20-%20Bloodlands_%20Europe%20between%20Hitler%20and%20Stalin-Basic%20Books%20%282010%29.pdf) - Bloodlands: Europe between Hitler and Stalin, Timothy Snyder
    
- During the initial stages of the war, Soviet forces were often ordered to stand their ground despite limited defensive capabilities, resulting in numerous encirclements and correspondingly high numbers of casualties.
    
    > `The organization of the camps in the east revealed a contempt for life, the life of Slavs and Asians and Jews anyway, that made such mass starvation thinkable. In German prisoner-of-war camps for Red Army soldiers, the death rate over the course of the war was 57.5 percent. In the first eight months after Operation Barbarossa, it must have been far higher. In German prisoner-of-war camps for soldiers of the western Allies, the death rate was less than five percent.` [[link]](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafykbzaceccblw5ub3z5dqoqr5pbwybapejk3bv2ppkfsemkk7ooi7lhrjfcm?filename=Timothy+Snyder+-+Bloodlands_+Europe+between+Hitler+and+Stalin-Basic+Books+%282010%29.pdf) - Bloodlands: Europe between Hitler and Stalin, Timothy Snyder

## 1941 Sikorski–Mayski Agreement
- On 30 July 1941, The Sikorski–Mayski agreement was a treaty between the Soviet Union and Poland that was signed in London. Its name is taken from its two most notable signatories: the prime minister of Poland, Władysław Sikorski, and the Soviet ambassador to the United Kingdom, Ivan Mayski.
- Stalin agreed to declare all previous pacts that he had with Nazi Germany null and void, to invalidate the September 1939 partition of Poland and to release tens of thousands of Polish prisoners-of-war held in Soviet camps. Pursuant to an agreement between the Polish government-in-exile and Stalin, the Soviets granted "amnesty" to many Polish citizens on 12 August 1941.
    - `1. The Government of the U.S.S.R. recognizes the Soviet-German treaties of 1939 as to territorial changes in Poland as having lost their validity. The Polish Government declares Poland is not bound by any agreement with any third power which is directed against the U.S.S.R.  
          
        2. Diplomatic relations will be restored between the two governments upon the signing of this agreement, and an immediate exchange of Ambassadors will be arranged. The two governments mutually agree to render one to another aid and support of all kinds in the present war against Hitlerite Germany.  
          
        3. The Government of the U.S.S.R. expresses its consent to the formation on territory of the U.S.S.R. of a Polish Army under a commander appointed by the Polish Government in agreement with the Soviet Government, the Polish Army on territory of the U.S.S.R. being subordinated in an operational sense to the Supreme Command of the U.S.S.R., in which the Polish Army will be represented. All details as to command, organization and employment of this force will be settled in a subsequent agreement.  
          
        4. This agreement will come into force immediately upon signature and without ratification. The present agreement is drawn up in two copies, in the Russian and Polish languages. Both texts have equal force.  
          
        The Soviet Government grants amnesty to all Polish citizens now detained on Soviet territory either as prisoners of war or on other sufficient grounds, as from the resumption of diplomatic relations.`

### Notes
- While many of the historic crimes were committed during Soviet era, there is a overlap of Stalin apologists in Marxist-Leninist circles and “oppose the west, support the rest” anti-USA far-right reactionaries thus contemporary sources about Tatar persecution under both Ukraine and Russian Federation as continuum from Imperial Russia and USSR is needed
- Some collaborated with fascist Germany but most did not.
- Many were glad at first from the Red Army liberating Crimea from germany
- 20,000 troops sent to punish the entire group for the crimes of a small group
- The NKVD struck all villages at once, quickly forced them out of their homes and deported even those who fought in the front and won awards etc. A third died in the process. People were shocked and didn’t believe that stalin would do this
- Stalin did the same thing to Chechens and kelmiks almost a million people
- Roma (Gypsy) communities that were integrated with Tatars were also deported by the Soviets: “On 18 May 1944 the Soviet authorities, on returning to the Crimea, also composed the trains of the Tatars to be deported based on the German lists, thus including the Gypsies listed as Tatars.”
- “In 1944 Crimean Tatar speaking Gypsies were also deported...They were perceived as Gypsies, which is why they were predetermined for annihilation from the Nazis during World War II but, according to Soviet statistics, they were defined as Tatars and so they were deported by the Soviet authorities, alongside the Crimean Tatars..." from “Gypsies in Central Asia and the Caucasus” by Elena Marushiakova and Vesselin Popov
- By adopting the new language law, Ukraine has implicitly abandoned the idea of returning Crimea
