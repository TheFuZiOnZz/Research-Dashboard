## 1936 Remilitarisation of the Rhineland
- [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remilitarisation_of_the_Rhineland)
- On 7 March 1936, using the Franco-Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance as a pretext, Hitler ordered the Wehrmacht to march 20,000 German troops into the Rhineland, which directly contravened the Treaty of Versailles and the Locarno Treaties, which caused joyous celebrations across Germany. The French and the British governments, unwilling to risk war, decided against enforcing the treaties.
