    - `The nuclear deal prohibits Iran from possessing any uranium that’s more than 3.67 percent U-235, and prohibits it from having more than 660 pounds of enriched uranium (about 97 percent less than it had prior to the deal). Iran is fully complying with these restrictions.`
      
      `Prior to the deal, Iran had close to 20,000 centrifuges at its uranium enrichment facilities, Natanz and Fordow. Under the deal’s terms, Iran can only enrich at Natanz, and can only operate a maximum of 5,060 older-model centrifuges (rather than newer, more efficient ones). Iran is fully complying with these restrictions.`
      
      `Iran has such a reactor in Arak; the deal requires Iran not to operate the facility and to redesign it such that it will not produce fissile material if operated. Iran is fully complying with these restrictions.`  
- The International Atomic Energy Agency said Iran has already increased production of enriched uranium.
    - `The head of the global nuclear watchdog has confirmed Iran is increasing its production of enriched uranium. But International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief Yukiya Amano said it was not clear when they will reach a limit set under a 2015 international deal. Iran announced last month that it would suspend some commitments in retaliation for sanctions reinstated by the US.` [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-48587347)
