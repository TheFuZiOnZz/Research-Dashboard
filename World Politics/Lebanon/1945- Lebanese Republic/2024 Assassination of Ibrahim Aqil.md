- On 20 September 2024, Israel launched an air attack that leveled an apartment building in the Dahieh suburb of Beirut, Lebanon. The attack killed at least 45 people, including 16 Hezbollah militants, two of whom were commanders, identified as Ibrahim Aqil and Ahmed Wehbe.
- Ibrahim Aqil was a Lebanese militant and senior official in Hezbollah. He was a member of the Jihad Council, which oversees the military and security operations of the organization. Aqil served as the head of operations and was considered by some as the de facto Chief of Staff of Hezbollah. He was also believed to be the head of the Redwan Force, an elite Hezbollah branch.
	- `Over the weekend, KAN News identified the man responsible for Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force – Ibrahim Aqil, a Hezbollah terrorist who has been sanctioned in the past by the US.`
	  
	  `The report noted that the Radwan Force includes many of Hezbollah’s elite fighters, and has suffered casualties in the last 60 days of tension with Israel in the North. More than 100 Hezbollah fighters have been wounded or killed since October 7, when the Lebanese-based terrorist group began to launch rockets, drones, and mortars at the Jewish state to support Hamas.`
	  
	  `The report said that Aqil is “also the one who is largely responsible over the last two years for the movement of Radwan personnel toward Israel’s northern border.” The report noted that under Aqil’s leadership, the elite force has seen several operational failures.`
	  
	  `“Dozens of failed launches of anti-tank missiles have led to casualties and damages to property on the Lebanese side,” it said, adding that “following the [pause in fighting on November 24], the presence of the Radwan Force in the border area has decreased, compared to the period before October 8, when Hezbollah joined the fighting… Since the firing was renewed yesterday in the North, Aqil continues to conduct his war effort, despite the many failures and deaths in the first round.”` - [Israel identifies Hezbollah’s Ibrahim Aqil as head of deadly Radwan unit, The Jerusalem Post, 2023](https://www.jpost.com/arab-israeli-conflict/article-776304)
- On 21 July 2015, the U.S. Department of the Treasury designated Ibrahim Aqil pursuant to Executive Order 13582 for acting for or on behalf of Hizballah. On 10 September 2019, the U.S. Department of State designated him as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist. On 18 April 2023, the Rewards for Justice program offered a reward of up to $7 million for information about Ibrahim Aqil.

	  `Ibrahim Aqil, also known as Tahsin, serves on Hizballah’s highest military body, the Jihad Council.`
	  
	  `During the 1980s, Aqil was a principal member of Islamic Jihad Organization—Hizballah’s terrorist cell—that claimed the bombings of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut in April 1983, which killed 63 people, and the U.S. Marine barracks in October 1983, which killed 241 U.S. personnel.`
	  
	  `In the 1980s, Aqil directed the taking of American and German hostages in Lebanon and held them there.`
	  
	  `On July 21, 2015, the U.S. Department of the Treasury designated Aqil pursuant to Executive Order 13582 for acting for or on behalf of Hizballah. Subsequently, on September 10, 2019, the U.S. Department of State designated Aqil as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist pursuant to Executive Order 13224, as amended.` - [Ibrahim Aqil – Rewards For Justice, U.S. Department of State, 2023](https://rewardsforjustice.net/rewards/ibrahim-aqil/)
- Ibrahim Aqil was reportedly involved in planning a Hezbollah operation in northern Israel, which was believed to be similar to the [October 7 Hamas-led attacks](../../Israel-Palestine/1948-%20Israeli-Palestinian%20Period/2023-%20Israel-Hamas%20War,%20Operation%20Al-Aqsa%20Flood,%20Operation%20Iron%20Swords).
	- `Elijah Magnier, a Brussels-based military and counterterrorism analyst with knowledge of the group, said he was one of the group’s old guard.`
	  
	  `“He started at the beginning of Hezbollah’s creation, and he moved to different responsibilities. To be a member of the Jihadi Council, this is the highest (post), and to be the leader of the Radwan Forces is also very privileged,” Magnier said.` - [Hezbollah commander killed in Israeli airstrike was top military official on US wanted list, AP News, 2024](https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-hezbollah-israel-mideast-tensions-attack-8ec89de2b117b52e2c09b19155e35d13)
	  `“The Israelis were right and wrong. They are right by saying they killed the one who was planning to conduct an operation similar to Oct. 7,” said Magnier, the analyst.`
	  
	  `In case of an Israeli ground invasion of Lebanon or a Hezbollah cross-border operation, Akil would have been the one leading the Radwan Forces. But he didn’t head the entire military operation against Israel, Magnier said.` - [Hezbollah commander killed in Israeli airstrike was top military official on US wanted list, AP News, 2024](https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-hezbollah-israel-mideast-tensions-attack-8ec89de2b117b52e2c09b19155e35d13)
