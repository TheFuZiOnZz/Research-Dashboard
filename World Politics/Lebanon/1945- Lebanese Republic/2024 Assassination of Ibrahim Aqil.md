- On 20 September 2024, Israel launched an air attack that leveled an apartment building in the Dahieh suburb of Beirut, Lebanon. The attack killed at least 45 people, including 16 Hezbollah militants, two of whom were commanders, identified as Ibrahim Aqil and Ahmed Wehbe.
- Ibrahim Aqil was a Lebanese militant and senior official in Hezbollah. He was a member of the Jihad Council, which oversees the military and security operations of the organization. Aqil served as the head of operations and was considered by some as the de facto Chief of Staff of Hezbollah. He was also believed to be the head of the Redwan Force, an elite Hezbollah branch.
	- `Over the weekend, KAN News identified the man responsible for Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force – Ibrahim Aqil, a Hezbollah terrorist who has been sanctioned in the past by the US.`
	  
	  `The report noted that the Radwan Force includes many of Hezbollah’s elite fighters, and has suffered casualties in the last 60 days of tension with Israel in the North. More than 100 Hezbollah fighters have been wounded or killed since October 7, when the Lebanese-based terrorist group began to launch rockets, drones, and mortars at the Jewish state to support Hamas.`
	  
	  `The report said that Aqil is “also the one who is largely responsible over the last two years for the movement of Radwan personnel toward Israel’s northern border.” The report noted that under Aqil’s leadership, the elite force has seen several operational failures.`
	  
	  `“Dozens of failed launches of anti-tank missiles have led to casualties and damages to property on the Lebanese side,” it said, adding that “following the [pause in fighting on November 24], the presence of the Radwan Force in the border area has decreased, compared to the period before October 8, when Hezbollah joined the fighting… Since the firing was renewed yesterday in the North, Aqil continues to conduct his war effort, despite the many failures and deaths in the first round.”` - [Israel identifies Hezbollah’s Ibrahim Aqil as head of deadly Radwan unit, The Jerusalem Post, 2023](https://www.jpost.com/arab-israeli-conflict/article-776304)
- On July 21, 2015, the U.S. Department of the Treasury designated Aqil pursuant to Executive Order 13582 for acting for or on behalf of Hizballah.
