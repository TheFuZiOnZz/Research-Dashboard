- In February 2024, Hezbollah's secretary-general at the time, Hassan Nasrallah, instructed the group's members to use pagers instead of cell phones, claiming Israel had infiltrated their cell phone network. Hezbollah then purchased Gold Apollo AR924 pagers about five months before the explosions. The Israeli intelligence agency (Mossad) had secretly manufactured the devices, integrated the explosive PETN into the devices, and sold them to Hezbollah through a shell company. International officials and scholars of the law of war have debated the legality of the attacks, with critics suggesting they might constitute war crimes or acts of terrorism.
