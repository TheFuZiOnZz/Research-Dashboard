- On 27 September 2024, Hassan Nasrallah, the secretary-general of Hezbollah, was assassinated in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut. The strike took place while Hezbollah leaders were meeting at a headquarters located underground beneath residential buildings in Haret Hreik in the Dahieh suburb to the south of Beirut. Conducted by the Israeli Air Force using F-15I fighters, the operation involved dropping more than 80 bombs, including US-made 2,000-pound bunker buster bombs, destroying the underground headquarters as well as nearby buildings.
- On 28 September 2024, the IDF announced the death of Hassan Nasrallah.
	- `Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of the terrorist army Hezbollah, was killed by the Israel Defense Forces in a precise strike in Beirut last night, while he was in Hezbollah’s Central Headquarters commanding more imminent attacks against the people of Israel.`
	  
	  `For decades, Hezbollah, under the command of Hassan Nasrallah, orchestrated countless attacks against innocent people. Hassan Nasrallah had the blood of thousands of men, women and children on his hands. Israelis. Jews across the world. Lebanese. Americans. British. French. Syrians and other countless victims across the Middle East and beyond.`
	  
	  `Hezbollah, under the command of Hassan Nasrallah, joined Hamas in attacking Israel on October 8th...just one day after Hamas‘s massacre on October 7th.` - [Press Briefing by IDF Spokesperson RAdm. Daniel Hagari- September 28, 2024, Israel Defence Force, 2024](https://www.idf.il/en/mini-sites/israel-at-war/briefings-by-idf-spokesperson-rear-admiral-daniel-hagari/september-24-press-briefings/press-conference-by-idf-spokesperson-radm-daniel-hagari-september-28-2024/)
- On 29 September 2024, Nasrallah's body was found in the rubble of the strike.
	- `The body of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has been recovered from the site of an Israeli air attack on Beirut's southern suburbs and is intact, a medical source and a security source told Reuters on Sunday.`
	  
	  `While Hezbollah's statement on Saturday confirming Nasrallah's death did not say how exactly he was killed nor when his funeral would be, the two sources said his body had no direct wounds and that it appeared the cause of death was blunt trauma from the force of the blast.` - [Nasrallah's body recovered from rubble two days after assassination, Ynet, 2024](https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1wspnlra)
- The attack resulted in at least 300 fatalities, including civilians. Ali Karaki, the Commander of Hezbollah's Southern Front, was also killed in the attack, along with other senior commanders. 
	- `The Lebanese Health Ministry said six people were killed and 91 injured in the strikes Friday that leveled six apartment buildings. Ali Karki, the commander of Hezbollah’s Southern Front, and other commanders were also killed, the Israeli military said.` - [Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah killed in Israeli strike, AP News, 2024](https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-hezbollah-airstrikes-28-september-2024-c4751957433ff944c4eb06027885a973)
- Iran’s U.N. Ambassador Amir Saeid said that Abbas Nilforoushan, deputy commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and commander of the Quds Force in Lebanon, was also killed.
	- `Iran’s U.N. Ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani wrote a letter to the heads of the United Nations and the Security Council on Saturday calling for an emergency council meeting over the attack that killed Nasrallah.`
	  
	  `“Using U.S.-supplied thousand-pound bunker busters,” he wrote, Israel killed Nasrallah and Iranian Gen, Abbas Nilforushan, among others.`
	  
	  `He warned Israel not to attack any of its diplomatic or consular premises, or its representatives. “Iran will not hesitate to exercise its inherent rights under international law to take every measure in defense of its vital national and security interests,” Iravani wrote.` - [Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah killed in Israeli strike, AP News, 2024](https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-hezbollah-airstrikes-28-september-2024-c4751957433ff944c4eb06027885a973)

- The strike was unannounced due to an historical analogue of an attempt to strike Nasrallah previously in the [2006 Lebanon War](2006%20Lebanon%20War,%20Israel-Hezbollah%20War) on 14 July 2006, in which the area planned to be struck was given 24 hour notice of the strike taking place giving Nasrallah and other Hezbollah officials time to be positioned in a more protective condition.
	- `Four members of the forum voted in favor of bombing Dahia (Shimon Peres, who was not present, telephoned his support). Two ministers, Dichter and Livni, were opposed. The military benefits of the bombing were marginal. Nasrallah, ensconced in a bunker beneath his residence, was protected by enough layers of cement to avoid injury. But Dahia was a symbol, and Israel’s ministers and officers wanted a move that would deliver a painful surgical blow to Hezbollah’s strength and honor. Although this was not specifically stated at the meeting, some participants realized that an attack on Dahia presaged all-out war against Hezbollah. The idea of “bang and it’s over” increasingly receded.` - 34 days: Israel, Hezbollah, and the war in Lebanon, Amos Harel & Avi Isacharoff, 2008
