### 1957-59 Mao's Anti-Rightist Campaign
- The Anti-Rightist Campaign in the People's Republic of China, which lasted from 1957 to roughly 1959, was a political campaign to purge alleged "Rightists", meaning capitalists, within the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the country as a whole.
- Mao used the Hundred Flowers Campaign to expose dissenters within Chinese society.
    - `Mao soon realized the magnitude of the menace he had provoked. On May 15, he sent out an internal circular to high-ranking party cadres instructing them to allow criticism to continue. The Chairman wanted the “rightists” to expose themselves in full; he was not content in getting only the small fry because he wanted “to catch the big fish, [and] ... dig ... out the poisonous weed” once and for all. In early June, Mao decided that the party would “counterattack.” The Chairman boasted that he had set up a trap by breaking the whole campaign “into many small ‘Hungarian incidents’ ... [to be] dealt with individually.` [link](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafykbzaced4sn3i7kz7dz5ye7tlwvaj2zlb5xuiooyj47rxobfcxtahuci2vy?filename=%28Princeton%20Studies%20in%20International%20History%20and%20Politics%29%20Lorenz%20M.%20L%C3%BCthi%20-%20The%20Sino-Soviet%20Split_%20Cold%20War%20in%20the%20Communist%20World-Princeton%20University%20Press%20%282008%29.pdf)
- Administering several provinces in the southwest, Deng Xiaoping proved so zealous in liquidating alleged counter-revolutionaries that even the Chairman felt obliged to write to him. Mao urged Deng Xiaoping to slow down the campaign's body count.
    - `The wave of public executions that engulfed Deng’s region was so large that the Chairman himself felt compelled to intervene. “We should not kill too many people,” he wrote to Deng on April 30, 1951. “If we kill too many, we will forfeit public sympathy and a shortage of labor power will arise.” He issued a new order: in the countryside execute no more than one in a thousand, and in the cities even less.` [link](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafykbzaceajwfdkecnp6cq3rzod3brl32j2oc4elrbjjpelyxzlob3r5qudki?filename=Alexander%20V.%20Pantsov%2C%20Steven%20I.%20Levine%20-%20Deng%20Xiaoping_%20A%20Revolutionary%20Life-Oxford%20University%20Press%20%282015%29.pdf)
  
- In 1960, Khrushchev slammed Mao in public while addressing a congress of the Romanian communist party.
    - `The most vitriolic disagreement was perhaps the one that took place at the congress of the Romanian Communist Party in 1960 between Khrushchev, who denounced Mao as a “nationalist, adventurist, and deviationist”` [link](http://jirfp.com/journals/jirfp/Vol_7_No_1_June_2019/4.pdf)
- The 1962 Sino-Indian war, instead of Moscow supporting its fellow communist nation in the month-long border clash it took the opportunity to strengthen its relationship with New Delhi offering arms and technology to be used against the Chinese. Beijing in extreme protest broke off its diplomatic relations with the soviet union making the split now official.
    - `On the Indian side political considerations were important. Relations with the Soviet Union had improved, and some visible form of military cooperation appeared likely to act as a restraint on China.` [link](https://sci-hub.ee/https://www.jstor.org/stable/2643691)
