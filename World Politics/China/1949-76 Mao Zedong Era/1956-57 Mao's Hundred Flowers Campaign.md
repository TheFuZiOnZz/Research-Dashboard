### 1956-57 Mao's Hundred Flowers Campaign
- The Hundred Flowers Campaign, was a period from 1956 to 1957 in the People's Republic of China during which the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) encouraged citizens to openly express their opinions of the Communist Party. However, the campaign proved too successful when blunt criticism of Mao was voiced.
    - `Since its inception in early 1956, the Hundred Flowers Campaign had hardly generated any echo outside the party. Although dissent in the PRC was rife, fear of potential repressions kept many mouths shut. Starting in mid-March 1957, the Chairman tried to reassure skeptics that the campaign would not lead to any repercussions. It was kicked off on May 1 with a public call to carry it out “as gently as a breeze or a mild rain.” In controlled meetings, those invited to speak tested the limits of the still unpublished Contradictions Speech. A significant number of people openly questioned the unchecked rule of the CCP, as well as the socialist system itself. Mao soon realized the magnitude of the menace he had provoked.` [link](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafykbzaced4sn3i7kz7dz5ye7tlwvaj2zlb5xuiooyj47rxobfcxtahuci2vy?filename=%28Princeton%20Studies%20in%20International%20History%20and%20Politics%29%20Lorenz%20M.%20L%C3%BCthi%20-%20The%20Sino-Soviet%20Split_%20Cold%20War%20in%20the%20Communist%20World-Princeton%20University%20Press%20%282008%29.pdf)
- Consequent to the relative freedoms of the de-Stalinized USSR, Mao retained the Stalinist model of Marxist–Leninist economy, government, and society.
    - `Further disagreements arose over the Hundred Flowers Campaign and Stalin’s mistakes in the Chinese Revolution. Far more serious, though, were differences linked to Khrushchev’s pursuit of two essentially contradictory strategic goals: relaxation of relations with the West and a close partnership with anti-imperialist China.` [link](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafykbzaced4sn3i7kz7dz5ye7tlwvaj2zlb5xuiooyj47rxobfcxtahuci2vy?filename=%28Princeton%20Studies%20in%20International%20History%20and%20Politics%29%20Lorenz%20M.%20L%C3%BCthi%20-%20The%20Sino-Soviet%20Split_%20Cold%20War%20in%20the%20Communist%20World-Princeton%20University%20Press%20%282008%29.pdf)
