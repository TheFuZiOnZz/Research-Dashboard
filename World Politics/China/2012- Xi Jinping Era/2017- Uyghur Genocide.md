## 2017- Uyghur Genocide
- Since 2017, China has held Uyghur people in re-education camps in Xinjiang.
- The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) did an investigation called the `China Cables` after receiving secret Chinese government documents which were leaked by exiled Uyghurs.
- The key findings of the investigation were: [link](https://www.icij.org/investigations/china-cables/)
    - `China Cables reveals, in the government’s own words and authoritative detail, a description of China’s extrajudicial internment and compulsory indoctrination of Muslims.`
    - `Confirms China's camps are involuntary indoctrination centers under heavy 24-hour guard — with high watchtowers, internal cameras and dedicated police bases.`
    - `China Cables exposes key details of China's mass-surveillance system that is used to control routine behavior, curb internal communication and isolate Xinjiang from the rest of the world.`
- `The secret documents came to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists via a chain of exiled Uighurs. Their authenticity was confirmed by several leading experts, including James Mulvenon, vice-president of Defense Group Inc, Adrian Zenz, a senior fellow in China studies at the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation in Washington, D.C. and several intelligence sources who cannot be identified. There is also a key signature on the documents: Zhu Hailun, head of Xinjiang’s Political and Legal Commission, A key signature. Two people our sources spoke to say they have seen Zhu’s signature and are certain it is his signature and handwriting. They have provided convincing explanations of how they encountered signatures.` [link](https://www.icij.org/investigations/china-cables/read-the-china-cables-documents/)
- The documents included a telegram of the operations manual for running the mass detention camps, four secret government intelligence briefings from the `Integrated Joint Operation Platform` a centralized data collection system and court documents which `describes the sentencing of a Uighur man to 10 years for such ideological “crimes” as telling co-workers “not to say dirty words” or watch pornography` [link](https://www.icij.org/investigations/china-cables/read-the-china-cables-documents/)
- The Camps
    - `Since spring 2017, Chinese authorities have detained more than a million Uighurs and other Muslim minorities in huge internment camps across Xinjiang, which is home to nearly 11 million Uighurs. The mass-detention operation is part of a larger push by Beijing to suppress political dissent and religious expression, particularly among minorities in a nation dominated by Han Chinese. The goal, experts say, is to reinforce Communist Party doctrine, a drive that has accelerated in recent years. After initially denying the camps’ existence, the Chinese government now claims that they are “vocational education and training centers” and are needed to help fight “terrorism and religious extremism.” But Western governments, nongovernmental organizations and Uighur refugees condemn the policy, and one U.S. commission calls the state of affairs in Xinjiang “one of the world’s worst human rights situations.”` [link](https://www.icij.org/investigations/china-cables/how-china-targets-uighurs-one-by-one-for-using-a-mobile-app/)
- Mass Surveillance
    - `Muslims worldwide have been flocking to a mobile file-sharing application called Zapya, developed by a Beijing-based startup that encourages users to download the Quran and share religious teachings with loved ones. The app, developed by DewMobile Inc., allows smartphone users to send videos, photos and other files directly from one smartphone to another without being connected to the web, making it popular in areas where internet service is poor or nonexistent. A leak of highly classified Chinese government documents, the China Cables, now reveal that since at least July 2016, Chinese authorities have been targeting users of the Zapya app, known in Chinese as Kuai Ya (fast tooth), as part of their crackdown against the Muslim Uighur population. Officials have closely monitored the app on some Uighurs’ phones and flagged its users for further investigation` [link](https://www.icij.org/investigations/china-cables/how-china-targets-uighurs-one-by-one-for-using-a-mobile-app/)
- China's Response
    - `In a written response to questions from ICIJ media partner The Guardian regarding the China Cables, the Chinese Embassy in the UK said the “so-called documents are pure fabrication and fake news.” The statement said: “First, there are no so-called ‘detention camps’ in Xinjiang. Vocational education and training centres have been established for the prevention of terrorism.” It added: “The preventative measures have nothing to do with religious groups. Religious freedom is fully respected in Xinjiang … (The) trainees take various courses at the vocational education and training centres, and the personal freedom of the trainees is fully guaranteed.” The camps are one facet of what the Chinese government calls a strategy to promote social stability. In authoritarian double-speak, detainees are called “students” and the camps are called “education centers,” from which students “graduate.” Zenz says official Xinjiang government websites often describe the camps as places to “wash brains, cleanse hearts.”` [link](https://www.icij.org/investigations/china-cables/about-the-china-cables-investigation/)
- Genocide Question - By the UNs definition, it is a genocide,
    - `In the present Convention, genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such: Killing members of the group; Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.` [link](https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/documents/atrocity-crimes/Doc.1_Convention%20on%20the%20Prevention%20and%20Punishment%20of%20the%20Crime%20of%20Genocide.pdf)
- On 31 August 2022, The United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commisioner released a report on `OHCHR Assessment of human rights concerns in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, People’s Republic of China`. It found that,
    - `Serious human rights violations have been committed in XUAR in the context of the Government’s application of counter-terrorism and counter-“extremism” strategies. The implementation of these strategies, and associated policies in XUAR has led to interlocking patterns of severe and undue restrictions on a wide range of human rights. These patterns of restrictions are characterized by a discriminatory component, as the underlying acts often directly or indirectly affect Uyghur and other predominantly Muslim communities.`
