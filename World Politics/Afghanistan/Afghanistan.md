- On 25 June 1973, King Mohammad Zahir Shah left Afghanistan for London, via Rome, for hemorrhaging treatment after injuring his eye. After treatment he went back to Italy spending time in the island of Ischia.
    - `King Zaher departed suddenly morning of June 25 for London via Rome, accompanied by HRH General Sardar Abdul Wali, HRH Shah Mahmud and wife Princess Mahbub Ghazi, former Minister of Health Ibrahim Majid-Seraj, King personal valet and confidant Rahim Panjshirt, and others.  
          
        King's sudden travel results from need for treatment for hemorrhaging in one eye, the eye injured approximately June, reportedly by a volleyball. Initially unsatisfactory by an Afghan physician led to an early morning visit to the Noor. Eye Clinic June 23, where he was examined by the American director of the Friesen (for Dept; fortuitous event which cannot alter Noor's precarious future,)  
          
        according to Majid-Seraj, injury is not especially serious and should not require surgery. He told Emboff that he expects to spend one-two weeks in London, followed by one-two weeks vacation.`

- On 17 July 1973, Army General and Prince Mohammad Daoud Khan led a coup d'état against his cousin, King Mohammad Zahir Shah supported by the People’s Democratic Party of Afghanistan. This resulted in the establishment of the Republic of Afghanistan under a one-party system led by Mohammad Daoud Khan.
    - `A pro-Soviet communist party, the People’s Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA), was formed in 1965 and backed a 1973 coup that overthrew the monarchy. The new regime, led by Mohammed Daoud Khan (1909–1978)` [link](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/bafykbzacecmqqg5pfw3k4whbldbxwqmb2os5q65u2abwcjoex4venkhcxy3gy?filename=Tom%20Lansford%20-%20Afghanistan%20at%20War_%20from%20the%2018th-Century%20Durrani%20Dynasty%20to%20the%2021st%20Century-ABC-CLIO%2C%20LLC%20%282017%29.pdf)
- The coup was uncontested with no challenge and with support from the military and many tribal leaders.
    - `So far there have been no reports of any serious challenge to the new Afghan regime headed by former Prime Minister (1953-63) Mohammad Daud. Assuming he stays in power, Daud seems unlikely to make any major shifts in Afghan policies, but there could be some changes in emphasis.  
          
        Daud's coups carried out yesterday by several hundred of his supporters in the Afghan Army, was well planned and swiftly executed. Daud app ears to have the support of key people in the army and apparently has maintained ties with many of the tribal groups that dominate most of this rural and backward nation. He could still have some trouble, however, with military units outside Kabul and/or with some of the tribes in the countryside.`

- Afghanistan at this time was renowned for its neutrality during many conflicts including World War One and Two and pledged to continue such neutrality in its new republic.
    - `Afghanistan remained neutral during World War II (1939–1945), as it had during World War I (1914–1918).` [link](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/bafykbzacecmqqg5pfw3k4whbldbxwqmb2os5q65u2abwcjoex4venkhcxy3gy?filename=Tom%20Lansford%20-%20Afghanistan%20at%20War_%20from%20the%2018th-Century%20Durrani%20Dynasty%20to%20the%2021st%20Century-ABC-CLIO%2C%20LLC%20%282017%29.pdf)
    - `Zahir Shah remained neutral in World War II and then reached out to the United States for aid and assistance, only to find successive U.S. administrations drawn increasingly to Pakistan as a strategic partner.` [link](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/bafykbzacecmqqg5pfw3k4whbldbxwqmb2os5q65u2abwcjoex4venkhcxy3gy?filename=Tom%20Lansford%20-%20Afghanistan%20at%20War_%20from%20the%2018th-Century%20Durrani%20Dynasty%20to%20the%2021st%20Century-ABC-CLIO%2C%20LLC%20%282017%29.pdf)
    - `In his broadcast, General Daud, who is 64 years old and a cousin as well as brother‐in law of the King, pledged that Afghanistan would continue her policy of nonalignment and would not join any military pact.` [[afghankingoverthrownarepub]]
- Most of the military equipment used in the Afghan army was from aid mainly from the Soviet Union.
    - `The nation, which depends heavily on foreign aid, has received substantial assistance under Zahir Shah from its neighbours, the Soviet Union and. China, and from the United States. Its armed forces are equipped mostly by the Soviet Union.` [[afghankingoverthrownarepub]]

- According to a Human Rights Watch report, based on eyewitness testimonies, the Soviet army occupied the Baraki Barak District on 6 September during the Logar offensives. They were expecting reinforcements from the Afghan Democratic Republic army in Kabul, but one of the officers defected to anti-communist resistance members, taking a large part of convoy with him. As reprisals, the Soviet army arrested 40 local civilians, tied them up, poured gasoline over them and set them on fire, burning them alive
    - `Patrick David and Francois Prey, French doctors working with Aide Medicale Internationale, witnessed a Soviet—Afghan offensive in Baraki Barak District of Logar Province, just south of Kabul, in September 1984- "They were bombing the houses and the people doing the harvest in the fields. They shot rockets at them and killed them." They reported that two boys, the 5—and sons of Gul Jan who were playing in a melon field in Chalozai, were wounded by rockets from a helicopter. Russian soldiers had come into the area and killed and looted.` [link](https://www.hrw.org/reports/1984/afghan1284.pdf)

### Notes
- The uprising against the Soviet-backed Afghan government was a military-led reaction to the purges, many of the students were Marxists, and many leading the uprisings were Maoists
- Soviet ambassadors were horrified by the purges and in response Soviet-backed Afghans pulled a whataboutism with purges occurred during the Russian Civil Wars and Stalinist purges during 1920s / 1930s
- The majority of Russians saw the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan as unnecessary and as a crime
- Decision to invade Afghanistan was undemocratic and did not receive support from Soviet institutes or councils, but instead amongst a handful of politicians
- The invasion of Afghanistan was deeply unpopular amongst Soviet Central Asians, which resulted in riots and protests followed by state-enforced repressions
- The mujahideen were not a monolith. It was a popular resistance to Soviet invasion that sprung up from all across the ideological spectrums. Most wouldn't fit into whatever is meant by the “War on Terror” categorization of religious extremists.
- After the USSR invaded Afghanistan, the US provided weapons and assistance to Ahmad Massoud. But he was not al-Qaeda. He was killed by al-Queda suicide bombers in 2001
- The conflation of mujahideen with “religious extremists” is in reference to Arab Maktab al Khidamat
- Maktab al Khidamat, the organization that preceded al-Qeuda, never received US funds. US funds were funnelled by the Pakistani ISI to seven separate Afghan mujahideen organizations. A favourite hardliner by Pakistani intelligence agency was the Hekmatyar.
- Pakistan never funded Bin Laden or the Arab Afghans with U.S. dollars— they were part of a different movement. The main source of funding of the Arab Afghans came from Saudi Arabia. The Arab Afghans often clashed ideologically with the local mujahideens and mostly did their own thing as a result.
- Soviet Central Asian recruits were not the reason why USSR lost as they were rotated out of the military in 1983
- In 1989, the Congress of People's Deputies morally and politically condemned the Soviet invasion
- The whole “religious extremist” revisionism with the Soviet-Afghan history in the (currently capitalistic) Russian Federation was retroactively retconned by Vladimir Putin and the Russian elites to ally the Russian state with Bush’s doctrine of “War on Terror”
- The Taliban was not a fighting force in the Afghan-Soviet War. Individuals, who later formed the Taliban often fought independently in various mujahadeen organizations, but they were never a political or unified force. Pakistan would not assist the Taliban to power until after 1994.
- The people visiting Ronald Reagan in the photo oppurunity were civilians, and one of them was feminist Afghan woman. It would be wrong to assume they are part of the mujahadeen or imply they religious fanatics
- Osama Bin Laden never met Ronald Reagan
- Bin Laden had no interest in international terrorism until he was influenced in this direction by Ayman al-Zawahiri
- Bin Laden was criticized several times by his comrades for carrying out attacks against the US while being a guest of the Taliban. And the Taliban government would have handed over Bin Laden with diplomacy if Bush hadn't invaded. Furthermore, the Bush administration demonstrated they were not interested in capturing Bin Laden because they were already planning to invade Iraq the year after
- Iran supported the Afghan jihad which was fought mostly by Sunnis but also Maoists as well
- PRC has their own geopolitical reasons for opposing the USSR thus funding and aiding mujahideens
- Operation Storm-333 (Шторм-333) was a covert operation that took place on December 27, 1979, in which Soviet special forces stormed the Tajbeg Palace in Afghanistan and assassinated communist Afghan President Hafizullah Amin
- Leninism and concept of the vanguard party is built into Hezbi Islami and Taliban’s vein of deobandism
