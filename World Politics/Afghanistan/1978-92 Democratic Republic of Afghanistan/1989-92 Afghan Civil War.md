### Notes
- The uprising against the Soviet-backed Afghan government was a military-led reaction to the purges, many of the students were Marxists, and many leading the uprisings were Maoists
- Soviet ambassadors were horrified by the purges and in response Soviet-backed Afghans pulled a whataboutism with purges occurred during the Russian Civil Wars and Stalinist purges during 1920s / 1930s
- The majority of Russians saw the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan as unnecessary and as a crime
- Decision to invade Afghanistan was undemocratic and did not receive support from Soviet institutes or councils, but instead amongst a handful of politicians
- The invasion of Afghanistan was deeply unpopular amongst Soviet Central Asians, which resulted in riots and protests followed by state-enforced repressions
- The mujahideen were not a monolith. It was a popular resistance to Soviet invasion that sprung up from all across the ideological spectrums. Most wouldn't fit into whatever is meant by the “War on Terror” categorization of religious extremists.
- After the USSR invaded Afghanistan, the US provided weapons and assistance to Ahmad Massoud. But he was not al-Qaeda. He was killed by al-Queda suicide bombers in 2001
- The conflation of mujahideen with “religious extremists” is in reference to Arab Maktab al Khidamat
- Maktab al Khidamat, the organization that preceded al-Qeuda, never received US funds. US funds were funnelled by the Pakistani ISI to seven separate Afghan mujahideen organizations. A favourite hardliner by Pakistani intelligence agency was the Hekmatyar.
- Pakistan never funded Bin Laden or the Arab Afghans with U.S. dollars— they were part of a different movement. The main source of funding of the Arab Afghans came from Saudi Arabia. The Arab Afghans often clashed ideologically with the local mujahideens and mostly did their own thing as a result.
- Soviet Central Asian recruits were not the reason why USSR lost as they were rotated out of the military in 1983
- In 1989, the Congress of People's Deputies morally and politically condemned the Soviet invasion
- The whole “religious extremist” revisionism with the Soviet-Afghan history in the (currently capitalistic) Russian Federation was retroactively retconned by Vladimir Putin and the Russian elites to ally the Russian state with Bush’s doctrine of “War on Terror”
- The Taliban was not a fighting force in the Afghan-Soviet War. Individuals, who later formed the Taliban often fought independently in various mujahadeen organizations, but they were never a political or unified force. Pakistan would not assist the Taliban to power until after 1994.
- The people visiting Ronald Reagan in the photo oppurunity were civilians, and one of them was feminist Afghan woman. It would be wrong to assume they are part of the mujahadeen or imply they religious fanatics
- Osama Bin Laden never met Ronald Reagan
- Bin Laden had no interest in international terrorism until he was influenced in this direction by Ayman al-Zawahiri
- Bin Laden was criticized several times by his comrades for carrying out attacks against the US while being a guest of the Taliban. And the Taliban government would have handed over Bin Laden with diplomacy if Bush hadn't invaded. Furthermore, the Bush administration demonstrated they were not interested in capturing Bin Laden because they were already planning to invade Iraq the year after
- Iran supported the Afghan jihad which was fought mostly by Sunnis but also Maoists as well
- PRC has their own geopolitical reasons for opposing the USSR thus funding and aiding mujahideens
- Operation Storm-333 (Шторм-333) was a covert operation that took place on December 27, 1979, in which Soviet special forces stormed the Tajbeg Palace in Afghanistan and assassinated communist Afghan President Hafizullah Amin
- Leninism and concept of the vanguard party is built into Hezbi Islami and Taliban’s vein of deobandism
