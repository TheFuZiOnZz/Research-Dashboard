- According to a Human Rights Watch report, based on eyewitness testimonies, the Soviet army occupied the Baraki Barak District on 6 September during the Logar offensives. They were expecting reinforcements from the Afghan Democratic Republic army in Kabul, but one of the officers defected to anti-communist resistance members, taking a large part of convoy with him. As reprisals, the Soviet army arrested 40 local civilians, tied them up, poured gasoline over them and set them on fire, burning them alive
    - `Patrick David and Francois Prey, French doctors working with Aide Medicale Internationale, witnessed a Soviet—Afghan offensive in Baraki Barak District of Logar Province, just south of Kabul, in September 1984- "They were bombing the houses and the people doing the harvest in the fields. They shot rockets at them and killed them." They reported that two boys, the 5—and sons of Gul Jan who were playing in a melon field in Chalozai, were wounded by rockets from a helicopter. Russian soldiers had come into the area and killed and looted.` [link](https://www.hrw.org/reports/1984/afghan1284.pdf)
