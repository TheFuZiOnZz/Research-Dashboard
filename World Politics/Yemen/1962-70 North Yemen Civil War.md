- [[link]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Yemen_Civil_War)
### Background
- Yemen
    - In 1955, Iraq-trained Colonel Ahmad Thalaya led a revolt against Imam Ahmad bin Yahya.
    - Ahmad bin Yahya defeated the besiegers, publicly decapitating Ahmad Thalaya and then executing Emir Saif el Islam Abdullah, the 48 year old Foreign Minister who was to become the new leader under Thalaya's demands.
    - In March of 1958, Ahmad bin Yahya's son, Muhammad al-Badr, went to Damascus to tell Nasser that Yemen would adhere to the United Arab Republic, as long as Ahmad could keep his throne and power.
    - In 1959, while Ahmad went to Rome for medical treatments, fights between tribal chieftains erupted. When Ahmad returned, he decapitated one of his subjects and amputated the left hand and right foot of 15 others.
    - Imam Ahmad died on September 18th, 1962, and was succeeded by his son, Muhammad al-Badr, who appointed Colonel Abdullah Sallal, a known socialist and Nasserist, as commander of the palace guard.
- Egypt
    - Nasser had desired regime change in Yemen since 1957, and acted in January of 1962 by supporting the Free Yemen Movement.
    - In a desire to continue his pursuit of Arab nationalism, especially after the dissolution of the UAR in 1961, Nasser supported a regime change in Yemen by supporting Colonel Abdullah Sallal.
    - Nasser's considerations for sending troops to Yemen may have included the following
        - impact of his support to the [Algerian War of Independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algerian_War_of_Independence) from 1954–62
        - Syria breaking up from Nasser's UAR in 1961
        - taking advantage of a breach in British and French relations, which had been strained by Nasser's support for the [FLN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Liberation_Front_(Algeria)) in [Algeria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria) and primarily for his efforts to undermine the [Central Treaty Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Treaty_Organization) (CENTO), which caused the downfall of the [Iraqi monarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Kings_of_Iraq) in 1958
        - confronting [imperialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperialism), which Nasser saw as Egypt's destiny
        - guaranteeing dominance of the [Red Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea) from the [Suez Canal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suez_Canal) to the [Bab-el-Mandeb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bab-el-Mandeb) strait
        - retribution against the [Saudi royal family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_royal_family), whom Nasser felt had undermined his union with Syria.
### History
- Coup d'état
    - Plot
        - Four different plots were happening simultaneously
            - Lieutenant Ali Abdul al Moghny
            - Colonel Abdullah Sallal, which eventually merged into...
            - The Hashid tribal confederation
            - Several young princes who wanted to get rid of al-Badr but not the imamate
        - On September 25th, 1962, Sallal gathered known leaders of the Yemeni nationalist movement and began enacting the coup.
    - Execution
        - By late morning of September 26th, all areas of Sana'a were secured and the revolutionaries had achieved victory over al-Badr and his guards.
    - Coup aftermath
        - Nasser sent Egyptian General Ali Abdul Hameed on September 29th to assess the situation.
        - Sallal gained control of Yemen and would be protected by a battalion of Egyptian special forces.
        - al-Badr went to Saudi Arabia.
- Diplomatic Attempts  
      
    - Teams
    - West Germany, The United Kingdom, The United States, and Jordan all supported al-Badr, the Imam.
    - Egypt, Italy, Yugoslavia and the USSR supported Sallal.
    - The US, under John F. Kennedy, tried to resolve the dispute while communicating with Nasser (Egypt), Faisal (Saudi Arabia), Hussein (Jordan) and Salla (Yemen). Nasser agreed to pull out, only if Jordan and Saudi Arabia also stopped their aggression, but Jordan and Saudi Arabia did not trust Egyptian intentions for the peninsula.
    - Sallal proclaimed he would follow Yemen's international obligations, including respect for Britain's Aden Protectorate, and Nasser promised a gradual withdrawal of its 18,000 man force, as long as Saudi Arabian and Jordanian forces retire from border regions.
    - On December 19th, 1962, the US recognized the Yemen Arab Republic, with the UN following the next day.
    - Britain, Iran, Turkey and most of western Europe did not recognize the republic, while West Germany, Italy, Canada, Australia, the remaining Arab governments, Ethiopia and the entire communist bloc did.
- Operation Hard-surface
    - The UN attempted to launch a mission based on the US National Security Council, in which a 25 mile demilitarized strip along the Saudi/Yemen border.
    - Egypt didn't really want to withdraw its forces, and Saudi Arabia had already begun cutting back support for royalists due to the threat of a combined Syria/Iraq/Egypt.
    - On September 4th, 1964, the UN admitted failure and ended the mission.
- Egyptian offenses
    - Egypt attempted to win an air war to substitute lack of ground power.
    - Egypt also bought off and sent humanitarian aid to many tribal leaders in order to encourage them to be loyal to the new republican government.
- Ramadan offensive
    - In February of 1963, Amer and Sadat arrived in Sana'a.
    - Amer requested 20,000 additional men for Yemen.
    - Fighting ensued between the Egyptian forces and the royalist forces for the next few months, with the royalist and Egyptian forces pushing each other's territory.
- Haradh offensive
    - More fighting.
- Alexandria summit and Erkwit ceasefire
    - In September of 1964, Faisal and Nasser met in an Arab summit in Alexandria, and agreed to reach a peaceful settlement to resolve the conditions in Yemen.
    - On November 4th, the Egyptians resumed their bombings of royalist positions, and the peace agreements fell through.
- Royalist offensive
    - More fighting.
- Stalemate
    - Lots of people dead on both sides.
    - Sallal fired his Premier, General Hassan Amri, and appointed a moderate, Ahmed Noman, in his place, in order to attempt to unite Yemen's two main tribal groupings, the mountain Zaidi Shias (royalists), and the Shafi'i Sunnis (republicans).
- Nasser's "long-breath" strategy
    - Egypt had run up a foreign debt of nearly $3b.
    - Nasser conceded they were facing difficulties, and raised a variety of taxes on the public to afford the war effort.
    - Nasser also supported Egyptian sabotage bombings in Saudi Arabia.
    - On May Day of 1966, Nasser said the war was entering the "long-breath strategy," where he would draw down troops from 70k to 40k and simply focus on reinforcing tighter positions, withdrawing from exposed positions. He also insisted on attacks on Najran, Qizan and other "bases of aggression", claiming they were originally Yemeni towns stolen by the Saudis in the 1930's.
    - Nasser was warned by both the US and the USSR not to escalate the conflict into a hot war with Saudi Arabia.
    - Tunisia broke diplomatic relations with the republic, and Sallal's government seemed on the verge of collapse.
- Chemical warfare
    - From 1963-1967 multiple gas attacks occurred against North Yemen villages, with claims that the Egyptians were behind the gas attacks.
    - By the end of July, 1967, 1,500 fatalities and 1,500 injuries were estimated among royalist Yemen villages.
- Egyptian Withdrawal
    - As part of the Khartoum Resolution, Egypt announced an end to the Yemen war.
    - Egypt and Saudi Arabia revived their Jeddah agreement of 1965.
    - Sallal accused Nasser of betrayal.
    - Sallal rapidly lost popularity at home, firing and appointing an entirely new Cabinet. Nasser in November of 1965 would encourage him to resign and go into exile. Once Sallal refused and went to Baghdad, hoping to get support from other Arab Socialists, Nasser sent a cable of Sana'a instructing his troops there not to block an attempt at a coup.
- Siege of Sana'a
    - The royalists sieged the newly created republican government headed by Qadi Abdul Rahman Iryani, Armed Noman and Mohamed Ali Uthman. The royalists suffered due to Saudi Arabia no longer shipping them arms nor financing them after the Khartoum agreement, however.
- Final Accords
    - By February of 1968, the seige was lifted and the republicans had won.
    - The British had withdrawn from South Yemen.
    - Talks commenced and in 1970 Saudi Araba recognized the Republican and a ceasfire was effected.
