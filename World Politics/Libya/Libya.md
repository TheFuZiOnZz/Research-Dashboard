- On 16 December 1986 - 11 September 1987, The Toyota War which took place in Northern Chad and on the Chad–Libya border at the Aouzou Strip, was the last phase of the Chadian–Libyan conflict. It takes its name from the Toyota pickup trucks, primarily the Toyota Hilux and the Toyota Land Cruiser, used to provide mobility for the Chadian troops as they fought against the Libyans, and as technicals. The 1987 war resulted in a heavy defeat for Libya, which, according to American sources, lost one tenth of its army, with 7,500 men killed and US$1.5 billion worth of military equipment destroyed or captured. Chadian forces only suffered 1,000 deaths.
