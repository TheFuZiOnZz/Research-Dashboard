#### 1939 Invasion of Finland, Winter War
- [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_War)
- [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Winter_War)
- In November 30 1939, under the auspices of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, the Soviet Union invaded Finland.
- The Finnish defensive effort defied Soviet expectations, and after stiff losses, as well as the unsuccessful attempt to install a puppet government in Helsinki, Stalin settled for an interim peace granting the Soviet Union parts of Karelia and Salla (9% of Finnish territory).

- Soviet official casualty counts in the war exceeded 200,000, while Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev later claimed the casualties may have been one million.

- After this campaign, Stalin took actions to modify training and improve propaganda efforts in the Soviet military.

- On December 14 1939, The Soviet Union is expelled from the League of Nations in response to the Soviet invasion of Finland.
    - `The lawless character of the achievement was perceived in nearly every foreign quarter. Russia's contempt for its numerous and well-defined treaty obligations towards its victim, as well as towards the League of Nations, was duly appraised and speedily condemned at Geneva.` ... `2. See Report of the Assembly, provided for in Art. 15, paragraphs 4 and 10, of the Covenant, submitted by the Special Committee of the Assembly, Dec. 13, 1939, League of Nations Official Journal, November-December, 1939, p. 531; also resolution adopted by the Council, Dec. 14, 1939, finding that by its act the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics had "placed itself outside the League of Nations," and declaring that it followed that that country was "no longer a member of the League."

#### 1940-44 Soviet, Then Nazi, Then Soviet Occupation of the Baltic States
- On 15 & 16 June 1940, under the auspices of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, The Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were extorted with having military bases on their territories, then later invaded and occupied by the Soviet Union.
    - `The independent functioning of the Baltic States was interrupted in June 1940 when, after the conclusion of the Treaty of Non-Aggression between Germany and the USSR of 23 August 1939 (Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact) and its Secret Additional Protocols, Soviet troops occupied the territories of the Baltic States.` - [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1163/221158903x00072)
    - `The experience of the first year of Soviet occupation saw Russians replace Baltic Germans and Poles as the most feared and disliked minority in the region. The pattern of takeover was similar in all three states. The first Soviet occupation followed the 23 August 1939 signing of the secret protocols of the Molotov–Ribbentrop pact, which sliced Eastern Europe into two spheres of influence. Estonia, Latvia and eventually Lithuania fell into the Soviet sphere. The Soviet Union then claimed to be threatened by the Baltic states, demanded that ‘mutual assistance agreements’ be signed, and then moved troops and political advisors into the three states (25,000 each in Estonia and Latvia). This was followed in 1940 by Soviet claims that the terms of the treaties had been broken, leading to more troops crossing the borders, to the forced dismissal of the acting cabinets and to new, hand-picked Soviet governments. As Soviet officials took hold of the region, each Baltic state held visibly falsified elections, followed by the coming to power of Soviet-friendly puppet governments. In August 1940 the newly elected Baltic legislatures sent delegates to Moscow to successfully apply for membership in the Soviet Union.` - [link](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/bafykbzaceay4daq6ol2nc5jsm52fmjzxyptudoad3thqdqcd3rbmqc6k43bya?filename=Daunis%20Auers%20-%20Comparative%20Politics%20and%20Government%20of%20the%20Baltic%20States_%20Estonia%2C%20Latvia%20and%20Lithuania%20in%20the%2021st%20Century-Palgrave%20Macmillan%20UK%20%282015%29.pdf)
- On 3-6 August 1940, after planning an installation of a pro-soviet puppet government in the Baltic States and ultimatums from the Soviets to the Baltic States, The three countries were then annexed into the Soviet Union as constituent republics.
    
    - `More sinister intentions are, however, suggested by evidence from the archives of the former government of Latvia which have recently been opened to Latvian scholars. It now appears that as early as December 1939 the Soviets were hoping to be able to take control of Latvia by exploiting left-wing and bourgeois elements in a pretence of a popular front government. The model was the puppet government set up at Terijoki under the Finnish communist Otto Kuusinen on 30 November 1939, the day that the Red Army invaded Finland.` - [link](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafykbzacedbyqrfvngivgnrqouegkxo2y7uct5shvoev2nda4agooeuiyw2lg?filename=Hiden%20John_%20Salmon%20Patrick%20-%20The%20Baltic%20nations%20and%20Europe_%20Estonia%2C%20Latvia%20and%20Lithuania%20in%20the%20twentieth%20century-Longman%20%281994%29.pdf)
    
    - `On 18 July ‘demonstrators’ in the major cities of the Baltic states called for their incorporation in the Soviet Union: three days later all three parliaments declared their countries Soviet republics and applied for membership. The formal incorporation of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia followed between 3 and 6 August 1940.` - [link](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafykbzacedbyqrfvngivgnrqouegkxo2y7uct5shvoev2nda4agooeuiyw2lg?filename=Hiden%20John_%20Salmon%20Patrick%20-%20The%20Baltic%20nations%20and%20Europe_%20Estonia%2C%20Latvia%20and%20Lithuania%20in%20the%20twentieth%20century-Longman%20%281994%29.pdf)
    
- On 22 June 1941, following Operation Barbarossa, the Nazi Germany attacked the Soviet Union and within weeks occupied the Baltic territories and by July 1941, the Third Reich occupied the Baltic territory.
    
    - `In such circumstances it is not surprising that many members of the majority populations of the Baltic countries welcomed the German armed forces when they crossed the frontiers of Lithuania on 22 June 1941 and pressed on into Latvia and Estonia. Since signing the Nazi—Soviet pact the Third Reich had displayed a conspicuous lack of concern for the fate of the three republics. In the autumn of 1939 it initiated the evacuation of the Baltic German populations of Estonia and Latvia, thus bringing to an end 700 years of Baltic German history.` - [link](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafykbzacedbyqrfvngivgnrqouegkxo2y7uct5shvoev2nda4agooeuiyw2lg?filename=Hiden%20John_%20Salmon%20Patrick%20-%20The%20Baltic%20nations%20and%20Europe_%20Estonia%2C%20Latvia%20and%20Lithuania%20in%20the%20twentieth%20century-Longman%20%281994%29.pdf)
    
- On 5 August 1944, the Soviet Union recaptured most of the Baltic states and they, again, were reorganized into constituent republics of the USSR.
    
    - `By the end of 1944, the Balkans had been largely cleared of Germans and the Baltic states retaken` - [link](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/bafykbzaceaqi6hbxgmvmevkmknkrebtx5kkhf6lgdv5i5oyyi74gkm6khqx2k?filename=William%20L.%20O%27Neill%20-%20World%20War%20II_%20A%20Student%20Companion%20%28Oxford%20Student%20Companions%20to%20American%20History%29%20%281999%29.pdf)
    
- The Baltic states themselves, the United States, the European Parliament and the European Court of Human Rights have all stated that these three countries were invaded, occupied and illegally incorporated into the Soviet Union under provisions of the [Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact](https://www.notion.so/27b787c817dd4ec6b105f068c07e9c03?pvs=21).
    
    - Latvia - `The annexation of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania is fundamentally illegal: it is based on intervention and occupation. That is why the annexation did not elicit juridical consequences. There was no change of sovereign power: the annexed state retained its sovereignty which the annexing state did not acquire. The status of the Baltic States as subjects of international law did not disappear. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania continued to exist de jure and their existence was recognized by 50 countries throughout the world. The non-recognition of the annexation was very important for the Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian nations. It served as the basis for their unceasing demand for the restoration of the independence of their countries.` - [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20071123015238/http://www.am.gov.lv/en/latvia/history/occupation-aspects/)
    
    - Estonia - `On 22 September 1944, units of the Red Army captured Tallinn. Although it was a milestone on the road to Allied victory in Europe, the recapture of Tallinn by Soviet forces was far from being a "liberation" for the Estonian people. It merely marked a change in foreign regimes and the beginning of a nightmarishly repressive occupation that would last for nearly 50 more years. The occupation was never recognized by most Western countries. For Estonia, World War II only ended, de facto, on 31 August 1994, with the final withdrawal of former Soviet troops from Estonian soil.` - [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20080723194014/http://www.estemb.org/estonia/history/aid-775)
    
    - United States - `From Sumner Wells' declaration of July 23, 1940, that we would not recognize the occupation. We housed the exiled Baltic diplomatic delegations. We accredited their diplomats. We flew their flags in the State Department's Hall of Flags. We never recognized in deed or word or symbol the illegal occupation of their lands.` - [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20120819185542/http://merln.ndu.edu/archivepdf/EUR/State/86539.pdf)
    
    - European Parliament - `In the Spring of 1990, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia declared their independence. By the end of the year, all the Republics of the Soviet Union had followed their example. Although the Member States of the Community, along with the majority of Western states, have always refused to recognize the annexation of the Baltic states, they reacted with great caution to the heightening of tension with the central authorities. In the first phase, the Twelve limited themselves to inviting the Soviet authorities to refrain from any act of intimidation, inconformity with Soviet commitments under the Helsinki Final Act and the Charter of Paris. They were also urged to open negotiations with elected representatives of the Baltic Republics ‘in order to meet, through a peaceful solution, the legitimate aspirations of the Baltic peoples’. A similar invitation was made in a letter from the President of the Council, Luxembourg Foreign Minister Poos, to Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze to condemn the use of force by Soviet troops in Vilnius.` - [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1093/oxfordjournals.ejil.a035821)
    
    - European Court of Human Rights - `The Court notes, first, that Estonia lost its independence as a result of the Treaty of Non-Aggression between Germany and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (also known as "Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact"), concluded on 23 August 1939, and the secret additional protocols to it. Following an ultimatum to set up Soviet military bases in Estonia in 1939, a large-scale entry of the Soviet army into Estonia took place in June 1940. The lawful government of the country was overthrown and Soviet rule was imposed by force. The totalitarian communist regime of the Soviet Union conducted large-scale and systematic actions against the Estonian population, including, for example, the deportation of about 10,000 persons on 14 June 1941 and of more than 20,000 on 25 March 1949. After the Second World War, tens of thousands of persons went into hiding in the forests to avoid repression by the Soviet authorities; part of those in hiding actively resisted the occupation regime. According to the data of the security organs, about 1,500 persons were killed and almost 10,000 arrested in the course of the resistance movement of 1944–1953. Interrupted by the German occupation in 1941–1944, Estonia remained occupied by the Soviet Union until its restoration of independence in 1991. Accordingly, Estonia as a state was temporarily prevented from fulfilling its international commitments.` - [link](https://www.stradalex.com/fr/sl_src_publ_jur_int/document/echr_23052-04_001-72404)
    
- The Baltic states recovered de facto independence during the Dissolution of the Soviet Union.
    

#### 1940-41 **Occupation of Bessarabia, Northern Bukovina and the Hertsa Region, now Moldova**

- [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_occupation_of_Bessarabia_and_Northern_Bukovina)
- [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertsa_region)
- On June 28th 1940, under the auspices of the [Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact](https://www.notion.so/27b787c817dd4ec6b105f068c07e9c03?pvs=21), The Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina took place from June 28 to July 3, 1940, as a result of an ultimatum by the Soviet Union to Romania on June 26, 1940, that threatened the use of force and were incorporated into the Soviet Union.
- As part of the 1941 Axis invasion of the Soviet Union, Romania regained the territories of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina, and seized a territory which became known as Transnistria Governorate. Romanian forces, working with the Germans, deported or massacred about 300,000 Jews, including 147,000 from Bessarabia and Bukovina. Of the latter, approximately 90,000 died.

#### 1940 Katyn Massacre

- [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katyn_massacre)
- The Katyn massacre was a series of mass executions of 22,000 Polish military officers and intelligentsia prisoners of war carried out by the Soviet Union, specifically the NKVD ("People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs", the Soviet secret police) in April and May 1940 as a part of the secret sections of [The Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact](https://www.notion.so/27b787c817dd4ec6b105f068c07e9c03?pvs=21).
    - `In March 1959 the KGB chief A.Shelepin wrote to Khrushchev requesting permission to dispose of the files concerning the 21 857 Poles who were shot as a result of this Politburo resolution. See Materski (ed.), pp. 26-28. Shelepin indicates that of the 21,857 Poles executed, 4,421 were executed near Katyn Forest in Smolensk oblast', 3,820 in Starobelsk in Kharkhov oblast', 6,311 in Ostashkov in Kalinin oblast' and 7,305 elsewhere. Since the Germans claim to have discovered 10,000 bodies in Katyn, it remains unclear who the other 5,500 victims in Katyn were.` - [link](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stephen-Wheatcroft-2/publication/233004050_The_scale_and_nature_of_German_and_Soviet_repression_and_mass_killings_1930-451_1/links/53dc2de60cf2cfac9928ffc5/The-scale-and-nature-of-German-and-Soviet-repression-and-mass-killings-1930-451-1.pdf) [link](https://archive.ph/nuNdN)

- The Soviets broke off talks in 1943 after the Polish government had demanded an independent examination of the discovered Katyn burial pits by the International Red Cross.
    - `Joseph Stalin broke off relations with the Polish government after it rejected his demand to blame the Germans and requested the International Red Cross to investigate the massacre. In spring–summer 1943, German, Polish, and other forensic experts examined the exhumed bodies and concluded that the crime had been committed on the orders of the Soviet authorities who now accused the Germans.` - [link](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafykbzaceahtgpx3c4lqeqe4iuskrfswvfz2zlaopsdgxcuvijspc4mmfdngg?filename=Anna%20M.%20Cienciala%2C%20Wojciech%20Materski%20-%20Katyn_%20a%20crime%20without%20punishment-Yale%20University%20Press%20%282007%29.pdf)

Note served verbally to the Polish Ambassador in Moscow, Tadeusz Romer in response to the Polish Government’s request of April 17, 1943 that the mass burial site of murdered Polish officers, discovered by the Germans in Katyn, be examined by an independent and impartial body - the International Red Cross.` ... `Both, the Polish Government and the Hitlerite government drew into the "investigation" the International Red Cross, compelled to participate in this farce of investigation in which Hitler appears to be the stage manager, in conditions of a terroristic regime with its gallows and mass extermination of the peaceful population. Understandably, such an "investigation", conducted behind the back of the Soviet Government, can not command confidence of people, possessing any degree of honesty.` - [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20050909042329/http://www.electronicmuseum.ca/Poland-WW2/katyn_memorial_wall/kmw_note.html)

- In 1990, Gorbachev recognised around 20% of the murders committed by the Red Army.
    - `The Soviet government officially accepts blame for the Katyn Massacre of World War II, when nearly 5,000 Polish military officers were murdered and buried in mass graves in the Katyn Forest. The admission was part of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev’s promise to be more forthcoming and candid concerning Soviet history.` - [link](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/soviets-admit-to-katyn-massacre)
- In 2010, the Russian State Duma then recognised the full amount of the murders committed by the Red Army.
    - `In November 2010, the Russian State Duma took a big step toward healing a decades-old rift with Poland by officially accepting Soviet responsibility for the Katyn massacre -- the mass killing of some 22,000 Polish military officers, religious figures, and intelligentsia in 1940. "Published documents, kept in classified archives for many years, not only revealed the scale of this horrific tragedy, but also showed that the Katyn crime was carried out on direct orders of Stalin and other Soviet officials," the declaration read,` - [link](https://www.rferl.org/a/after-80-years-the-katyn-lie-lives-on-in-russia/30470317.html)

#### 1940 Tripartite Pact

- The Tripartite Pact, also known as the Berlin Pact, was an agreement between Germany, Italy, and Japan signed in Berlin on 27 September 1940 by, respectively, Joachim von Ribbentrop, Galeazzo Ciano and Saburō Kurusu. It was a defensive military alliance that was eventually joined by Hungary (20 November 1940), Romania (23 November 1940), Bulgaria (1 March 1941) and Yugoslavia (25 March 1941) as well as by the German client state of Slovakia (24 November 1940).
    
- The pact included mention of that its formation that the pact wouldn’t effect Soviet Russia
    
    - `Germany, Italy and Japan affirm that the aforesaid terms do not in any way affect the political status which exists at present as between each of the three contracting powers and Soviet Russia.` - [link](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/wwii/triparti.asp)
    

#### 1941 Invasion of the Soviet Union, Operation Barbarossa

- Operation Barbarossa was the invasion of the Soviet Union by Nazi Germany and most of the Axis leaders, starting on 22 June 1941 which made the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact then unofficially terminated and then officially terminated on 30 July 1941 in the Sikorski–Mayski Agreement.
    
- Stalin was caught off but this invasion by the Nazis and thought reports from Soviet agents warning him of a potential invasion were the Nazi’s hard-balling for more economic concessions.
    
    - `For all its multinational trimmings, therefore, ‘Operation Barbarossa’ was thus in essence to be a German operation. As the winter snows of East-Central Europe melted and the ground thawed, the German armed forces began moving vast masses of men and equipment up to the Soviet border. Throughout May and early June 1941, Zygmunt Klukowski recorded endless columns of German troops and vehicles passing through his region of Poland, noting the passage of between 500 and 600 vehicles on 14 June alone, for example. Stalin hurriedly launched a futile policy of trying to appease the Germans by stepping up Soviet deliveries of Asian rubber and other supplies under the trade agreement signed in January 1941. As a dogmatic Marxist-Leninist, Stalin was convinced that Hitler’s regime was the tool of German monopoly capitalism, so that if he made available everything German business wanted, there would be no immediate reason to invade. Already, under trade provisions agreed under the Nazi-Soviet Pact early the previous year, the Soviet Union was supplying nearly threequarters of Germany’s requirement of phosphates, over two-thirds of its imported asbestos, only a little less of its chrome ore, over half its manganese, over a third of its imported nickel, and, even more crucially, more than a third of its imported oil. Stalin personally vetoed proposals to disrupt the German military build-up by attacking across the Polish demarcation line. Reports from Soviet agents and even from members of the German embassy in Moscow that an invasion was imminent only convinced him that the Germans were playing hard-ball in their drive to extract economic concessions from him.` - [link] - The Third Reich at war, Richard Evans
    
- Stalin’s trust in Soviet intelligence agents was low because of the relaying of correct Nazi planned dates that were delayed, and Stalin interpreting that as people pushing him towards preemptive war with Germany and when informed by a deserted Nazi soldier of the what became the true date of the invasion, Stalin had him shot for spreading disinformation.
    
    - `At the same time, Stalin realized that, as he told graduating military cadets in Moscow on 5 May 1941, ‘War with Germany is inevitable.’ Molotov might be able to postpone it for two or three months, but in the meantime it was vital to ‘re-teach our army and our commanders. Educate them in the spirit of attack.’ Delivered to young officers as a rhetorical message for the future, this was not a statement of intent. Stalin did not believe that the Red Army would be ready to deal with the Germans until 1942 or perhaps even 1943. Not only had the General Staff not drawn up any plans for an attack on the German forces, it had no plans for a defence against them either. Although the Germans mounted a large and sophisticated deception plan to conceal the true nature of their intentions, Soviet intelligence began to send in accurate reports that the invasion was planned for around 22 June 1941. But Stalin would not listen. Earlier reports that the invasion plans were to become operational on 15 May 1941, though correct at the time, proved wrong when the Germans delayed Barbarossa in order to mount the invasion of Greece and Yugoslavia. Hitler later blamed Mussolini for the consequences, but in fact the weather in East-Central Europe in these weeks would have made an invasion of the Soviet Union inadvisable even had the German Leader not been obliged to step in to rescue his Italian ally from the imbroglio in Southern Europe. The Soviet agents who had made the prediction lost all credibility as a result. The capitalist forces in Britain, including the exiled Polish government, seemed to Stalin’s narrow and suspicious mind to be feeding false information to him about German intentions in order to lure him into a battle. Surely in any case the German Leader would not invade while the conflict with Britain was still unresolved. When an ex-Communist soldier deserted the German forces on 21 June 1941 and swam across a river to tell the Russians on the other side that his unit had been given orders to invade the following morning, Stalin had him shot for spreading ‘disinformation’.` - [link] - The Third Reich at war, Richard Evans
    
- The Red Army had little time to correct its numerous deficiencies before Nazi Germany and other Axis countries allied with it swept across the newly relocated Soviet border on June 22, 1941, in the opening stages of Operation Barbarossa.
    
    - `The twenty-second of June 1941 is one of the most significant days in the history of Europe. The German invasion of the Soviet Union that began that day under the cryptonym Operation Barbarossa was much more than a surprise attack, a shift of alliances, or a new stage in a war. It was the beginning of a calamity that defies description. The engagement of the Wehrmacht (and its allies) with the Red Army killed more than ten million soldiers, not to speak of the comparable number of civilians who died in flight, under bombs, or of hunger and disease as a result of the war on the eastern front` - [link](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafykbzaceccblw5ub3z5dqoqr5pbwybapejk3bv2ppkfsemkk7ooi7lhrjfcm?filename=Timothy+Snyder+-+Bloodlands_+Europe+between+Hitler+and+Stalin-Basic+Books+%282010%29.pdf) - Bloodlands: Europe between Hitler and Stalin, Timothy Snyder
    
- Hitler thought Stalin was the safer option to side with compared to the Polish.
    
    - `Hitler himself later explained his failure to conclude a new nonaggression pact with Poland by his lack of confidence in the Poles. They were within striking distance of vital industrial areas in eastern Germany and Bohemia, and he believed they would take the first possible opportunity to stab Germany in the back. Stalin, who in Hitlers opinion could not risk a war under any circumstances, was in that respect a safer treaty partner, as well as being several hundred kilometers farther removed from the German border. Once Hitler had convinced himself he could not rely on Poland, he evidently decided Poland would have to eliminated before he took action against the West. Just when he made the decision to attack Poland, however, is difficult to determine.` - [link](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/bafykbzacebi7fvuwrky3v3ggchh6zwcupwfb6on22zaennjlbo3loolhsl5yy?filename=%28Hitler%27s%20War%20Aims%29%20Norman%20Rich%20-%20Hitler%27s%20War%20Aims_%20Ideology%2C%20the%20Nazi%20State%2C%20and%20the%20Course%20of%20Expansion-W.%20W.%20Norton%20%20Company%20%281992%29.pdf) - Hitler's war aims, Norman Rich
    
- Hitler expected the Operation to not take as much time as it did.

- During the initial stages of the war, Soviet forces were often ordered to stand their ground despite limited defensive capabilities, resulting in numerous encirclements and correspondingly high numbers of casualties.
    
    - `The organization of the camps in the east revealed a contempt for life, the life of Slavs and Asians and Jews anyway, that made such mass starvation thinkable. In German prisoner-of-war camps for Red Army soldiers, the death rate over the course of the war was 57.5 percent. In the first eight months after Operation Barbarossa, it must have been far higher. In German prisoner-of-war camps for soldiers of the western Allies, the death rate was less than five percent.` - [link](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafykbzaceccblw5ub3z5dqoqr5pbwybapejk3bv2ppkfsemkk7ooi7lhrjfcm?filename=Timothy+Snyder+-+Bloodlands_+Europe+between+Hitler+and+Stalin-Basic+Books+%282010%29.pdf) - Bloodlands: Europe between Hitler and Stalin, Timothy Snyder

#### 1941 Sikorski–Mayski Agreement

- On 30 July 1941, The Sikorski–Mayski agreement was a treaty between the Soviet Union and Poland that was signed in London. Its name is taken from its two most notable signatories: the prime minister of Poland, Władysław Sikorski, and the Soviet ambassador to the United Kingdom, Ivan Mayski.
    
- Stalin agreed to declare all previous pacts that he had with Nazi Germany null and void, to invalidate the September 1939 partition of Poland and to release tens of thousands of Polish prisoners-of-war held in Soviet camps. Pursuant to an agreement between the Polish government-in-exile and Stalin, the Soviets granted "amnesty" to many Polish citizens on 12 August 1941.
    
    - `1. The Government of the U.S.S.R. recognizes the Soviet-German treaties of 1939 as to territorial changes in Poland as having lost their validity. The Polish Government declares Poland is not bound by any agreement with any third power which is directed against the U.S.S.R.
    
    2. Diplomatic relations will be restored between the two governments upon the signing of this agreement, and an immediate exchange of Ambassadors will be arranged. The two governments mutually agree to render one to another aid and support of all kinds in the present war against Hitlerite Germany.
        
    3. The Government of the U.S.S.R. expresses its consent to the formation on territory of the U.S.S.R. of a Polish Army under a commander appointed by the Polish Government in agreement with the Soviet Government, the Polish Army on territory of the U.S.S.R. being subordinated in an operational sense to the Supreme Command of the U.S.S.R., in which the Polish Army will be represented. All details as to command, organization and employment of this force will be settled in a subsequent agreement.
        
    4. This agreement will come into force immediately upon signature and without ratification. The present agreement is drawn up in two copies, in the Russian and Polish languages. Both texts have equal force.
        
    
    The Soviet Government grants amnesty to all Polish citizens now detained on Soviet territory either as prisoners of war or on other sufficient grounds, as from the resumption of diplomatic relations.` - [link](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/bafykbzacedk4o3mawvpupcurbvzmdnxqcrs4jybzzc4rnxtj6w77pf7x6pkga?filename=J%C3%B3zef%20Garli%C5%84ski%20%28auth.%29%20-%20Poland%20in%20the%20Second%20World%20War-Palgrave%20Macmillan%20UK%20%281985%29.pdf)
    
- The Soviets broke off talks again in 1943 after the Polish government had demanded an independent examination of the recently discovered [Katyn burial pits](https://www.notion.so/Geo-Politics-8ab38a7f4fb84ec09ae3895794c0539c?pvs=21) by the International Red Cross.
    
    - `Copy of the Soviet Note of April 25, 1943, severing unilaterally Soviet-Polish diplomatic relations. Note served verbally to the Polish Ambassador in Moscow, Tadeusz Romer in response to the Polish Government’s request of April 17, 1943 that the mass burial site of murdered Polish officers, discovered by the Germans in Katyn, be examined by an independent and impartial body - the International Red Cross.` ... `Both, the Polish Government and the Hitlerite government drew into the "investigation" the International Red Cross, compelled to participate in this farce of investigation in which Hitler appears to be the stage manager, in conditions of a terroristic regime with its gallows and mass extermination of the peaceful population. Understandably, such an "investigation", conducted behind the back of the Soviet Government, can not command confidence of people, possessing any degree of honesty.` - [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20050909042329/http://www.electronicmuseum.ca/Poland-WW2/katyn_memorial_wall/kmw_note.html)

### Notes

- While many of the historic crimes were committed during Soviet era, there is a overlap of Stalin apologists in Marxist-Leninist circles and “oppose the west, support the rest” anti-USA far-right reactionaries thus contemporary sources about Tatar persecution under both Ukraine and Russian Federation as continuum from Imperial Russia and USSR is needed
- Some collaborated with fascist Germany but most did not.
- Many were glad at first from the Red Army liberating Crimea from germany
- 20,000 troops sent to punish the entire group for the crimes of a small group
- The NKVD struck all villages at once, quickly forced them out of their homes and deported even those who fought in the front and won awards etc. A third died in the process. People were shocked and didn’t believe that stalin would do this
- Stalin did the same thing to Chechens and kelmiks almost a million people
- Roma (Gypsy) communities that were integrated with Tatars were also deported by the Soviets: “On 18 May 1944 the Soviet authorities, on returning to the Crimea, also composed the trains of the Tatars to be deported based on the German lists, thus including the Gypsies listed as Tatars.”
- “In 1944 Crimean Tatar speaking Gypsies were also deported...They were perceived as Gypsies, which is why they were predetermined for annihilation from the Nazis during World War II but, according to Soviet statistics, they were defined as Tatars and so they were deported by the Soviet authorities, alongside the Crimean Tatars..." from “Gypsies in Central Asia and the Caucasus” by Elena Marushiakova and Vesselin Popov
- By adopting the new language law, Ukraine has implicitly abandoned the idea of returning Crimea
