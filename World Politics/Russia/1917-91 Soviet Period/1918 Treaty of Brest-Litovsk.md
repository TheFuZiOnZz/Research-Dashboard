	  `ARTICLE 3`
	  
	  `The territories lying to the west of the line determined by the contracting powers and which formerly belonged to Russia will no longer be under her sovereignty. The line determined upon is marked on the appended map (Appendix I), which is an important part of the present treaty of peace.(3) The precise location of this line will be worked out by a German-Russian commission.`
	  
	  `In respect to the mentioned territories no obligations towards Russia are to be considered as issuing from their formerly having belonged to that country.`

Mixed commissions are to be formed for the purpose of framing more concise regulations and especially for the purpose of publication of general information as to safe courses of sailing for trading vessels. Such courses must always be free of floating mines.` - [Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, 1918](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/bl34.asp#treatytext)

    - `The terms of the Brest-Litovsk Treaty, which the Russians signed on March 3, were extremely burdensome. They give an idea of what the Allies would have faced had they lost the war. Russia had to make major territorial concessions which deprived her of the conquests made in the west since the middle of the seventeenth century. She had to give lip Poland, Finland, and the Ukraine, as well as Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and Transcaucasia.` - A Concise History of the Russian Revolution, Richard Pipes, 1995
    - `Lenin has been widely credited with prophetic vision in accepting a humiliating treaty which gave him the time he needed to organize his government, and which collapsed of its own weight once Germany surrendered to the Allies on November 11, 1918. When the Bolsheviks renounced the Brest-Litovsk Treaty two days later, Lenin's stock in Bolshevik ranks rose to unprecedented heights. Nothing he had done contributed more to his reputation for infallibility; he never again had to threaten resignation to have his way.` - A Concise History of the Russian Revolution, Richard Pipes, 1995
- The motivations of this treaty has been renounced to be what the future actions the Soviet Union’s Foreign Policy would be.
    - `The circumstances surrounding the Brest-Litovsk Treaty furnish the classic model of what was to become Soviet foreign policy for the next seventy years. Its principles may be summarized as follows:`
      
      `I. The highest priority at all times is to be assigned to the retention of political power-that is, sovereign authority and control of the state apparatus over some part-no matter how small-of one's national territory. This is the irreducible minimum. No price is too high to secure it; for its sake anything and everything can be sacrificed: human lives, land and resources, national honor. The premise behind this principle is that time works for communism, for which reason whatever is given up today will be regained tomorrow.`
      
      `Ever since Russia underwent the October Revolution, which turned her into the focal point of world socialism, her security and interests have taken precedence over the security and interests of any other country, cause, or party, including those of the "international proletariat."`
      
      `To purchase temporary advantages, it is permissible to make peace with "imperialist" countries, but such peace must be treated as an armed truce, to be broken when the situation changes in one's favor. History teaches, Lenin said in arguing for the ratification of the Brest-Litovsk Treaty, that peace is nothing but "a breathing spell for war." As long as capitalism exists, he declared in May I9I8, international agreements are but "scraps of paper." Even in periods of nominal peace, hostilities should be pursued by covert means to undermine governments with which one has signed peace agreements.`
      
      `4· Politics being warfare, foreign policy must always be conducted unemotionally, with the closest attention being paid to the correlation of forces. In Lenin's words: We have great revolutionary experience, and from that experience we have learned that it is necessary to follow the tactics of relentless advance whenever objective conditions allow it ... But we have to adopt the tactic of procrastination, the slow gathering of forces when the objective conditions do not offer the possibility of making an appeal to the general relentless advance.` 
      
      `Yet another fundamental principle of Bolshevik foreign policy was to be revealed after the signing of the Brest-Litovsk Treaty: the principle that Bolshevik interests abroad (as at home) had to be promoted by the application of the "divide and rule" principle: the most circumspect, careful, cautious, skillful exploitation of-every, even the smallest "crack" among one's enemies, of every conflict of interest among the bourgeoisie of the various countries, among the various groupings or species of the bourgeoisie within individual countries` - A Concise History of the Russian Revolution, Richard Pipes, 1995
- This treaty was later anulled as a part of the Russian Civil War.
