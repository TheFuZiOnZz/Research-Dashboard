- On 7 November 1917 (25 October Old Style), The October Revolution was a revolution in Russia led by the Bolshevik Party of Vladimir Lenin. It was the second revolutionary change of government in Russia in 1917. It took place through an armed insurrection in Petrograd (now Saint Petersburg). It was the precipitating event of the Russian Civil War.
- The October Revolution followed and capitalized on the February Revolution earlier that year.
    - `The Bolshevik coup went through two phases. In the first, during which Lenin assumed direct command, the strategy was to replicate the events of February and bring the government down by street demonstrations.` - A Concise History of the Russian Revolution, Richard Pipes, 1995
- The left-wing Bolsheviks were deeply unhappy with the government, and began spreading calls for a military uprising. On 23 October 1917 (10 October Old Style), the Petrograd Soviet, led by Trotsky, voted to back a military uprising.
    - `Although Lenin wanted immediate action, he had to yield to the majority of his associates, who preferred that the coup be carried out in the name of the soviets. Since a genuinely elected national congress of soviets was almost certain to yield a Bolshevik minority, Trotsky and his lieutenants proceeded to convene a congress composed mostly of those soviets in which they had assured majorities. Ignoring the protests of the Ispolkom that it alone had the right to convene congresses of soviets, they created a spurious "Northern Regional Committee" composed of eleven Bolsheviks and six Left SRs (a splinter from the SR Party, temporarily affiliated with them). This committee, arrogating itself the authority of the Ispolkom, invited soviets and military committees to send delegates to the forthcoming Congress.` - A Concise History of the Russian Revolution, Richard Pipes, 1995
- On 6 November 1917 (24 October Old Style), the government shut down numerous newspapers and closed the city of Petrograd in an attempt to forestall the revolution; minor armed skirmishes broke out.
    - `Although signed by Lenin, it was actually drafted by Anatolii Lunacharskii, the Commissar of Enlightenment. It called for the shutting down of the "counterrevolutionary" press, by which were meant all newspapers that refused to acknowledge the legitimacy of the October coup-in effect, the entire press except for the organs of the Bolsheviks and Left SRs` - A Concise History of the Russian Revolution, Richard Pipes, 1995
- The next day a full scale uprising erupted as a fleet of Bolshevik sailors entered the harbor and tens of thousands of soldiers rose up in support of the Bolsheviks. Bolshevik Red Guards forces under the Military-Revolutionary Committee began the occupation of government buildings on 25 October (O.S.; 7 November, N.S.), 1917. The following day, the Winter Palace (the seat of the Provisional government located in Petrograd, then capital of Russia) was captured.
    - `That night (October 24-25), Bolshevik units methodically took control of the key points in the city by the simple procedure of posting pickets. Junker guards, told to retire, either withdrew voluntarily or were disarmed. Thus, under cover of darkness, the Milrevkom occupied, one by one, railroad stations, postal, telephone and telegraph offices, banks, and bridges. No resistance was encountered, no shots exchanged.` - A Concise History of the Russian Revolution, Richard Pipes, 1995
    - `The cabinet that Lenin had declared deposed sat in the Malachite Room of the Winter Palace awaiting help. Five thousand Kronshtadt sailors brought in by the Bolsheviks to seize the government's last stronghold had no heart for battle.` - A Concise History of the Russian Revolution, Richard Pipes, 1995
- As the Revolution was not universally recognized, the country descended into the Russian Civil War, which would last until 1923 and ultimately lead to the creation of the Soviet Union in late 1922.
