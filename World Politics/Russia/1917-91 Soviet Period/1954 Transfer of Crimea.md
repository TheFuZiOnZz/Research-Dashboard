## 1954 Transfer of Crimea
- In 1954, the Crimean Oblast was incorporated into the Ukrainian SSR following administrative action of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. The action was attributed to Nikita Khrushchev, then-First Secretary of the Communist Party.
    - `The agenda of the session of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which took place January 25, 1954, contained a question about the delivery of the Crimean region to the structure of the Ukrainian SSR. The discussion of the question took only 15 minutes. The participants of the meeting approved the decree, and the region was given away to Ukraine for free. Not a single protest was made; no one had any doubts about the decision. No one wondered how the population (presumably the Russian-speaking population) of Crimea would treat the decision. It turned out that such important issues as the territorial movement of regions could be solved without any difficulties at all.` - [USSR's Nikita Khrushchev gave Russiaâ€™s Crimea away to Ukraine in only 15 minutes, Pravda, 2009](https://english.pravda.ru/history/107129-ussr_crimea_ukraine/)
