- Between 8–16 March 1917 (23 February Old Style), The February Revolution was the first of two revolutions which took place in Russia in 1917.
- The main events of the revolution took place in and near Petrograd (present-day Saint Petersburg), the then-capital of Russia, where long-standing discontent with the monarchy erupted into mass protests against food rationing.
    - `The day after Nicholas's departure, disorders broke out in Petrograd. They began with a demonstration on International Woman's Day (February 23). The event proceeded peacefully,`
    - `On February 24, the situation in the capital deteriorated when up to 200,000 idle workers, either on strike or locked out, filled the streets. On the city's main thoroughfare, Nevsky Prospekt, crowds shouted "Down with the autocracy!" and "Down with the war!" Here and there, mobs sacked food stores. The following day the crowds, emboldened by the lack of a vigorous response, grew still more aggressive. Apparently under the influence of radical intellectuals, the demonstrations now assumed a distinctly political character, with red banners making their appearance bearing evolutionary slogans, some of which read "Down with the German Woman!" In several city quarters, gendarmes came under attack.` - A Concise History of the Russian Revolution, Richard Pipes, 1995
- On 15 March (2 March Old Style), Nicholas II agreed Abdicated the throne of the Russian Empire on behalf of himself and his son, Tsarevich Alexei Nikolaevich, in favor of his brother Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich. This led to the establishment of a Democratic Dual Power structure of Russia for a brief period between the Provisional Government made from the original official State Duma and the Petrograd Soviet made up of workers councils.
    - `A provisional government under Prince L’vov was nominated by the Duma’s leaders acting as a provisional committee on 14 March. It forced the Tsar to abdicate on behalf of himself and his son in favour of Grand Duke Michael on 15 March (2 March). Michael then also renounced the throne on the following day. Alekseev became Commander-in-Chief, Guchkov War Minister, and Miliukov Foreign Minister. Alexander Kerensky, a lawyer and Trudovik deputy who now proclaimed himself a Socialist Revolutionary, also joined as Justice Minister, having been elected president of the self-styled ‘soviet’ within the Duma.` - The Great War: 1914-1918, Ian F. W. Beckett, 2007
- On 16 March (3 March Old Style) the Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich refused to accept the imperial authority, stating that he would accept it only if that was the consensus of democratic action by the Russian Constituent Assembly, which shall define the form of government for Russia.
    - `A heavy burden has been laid upon Me by the will of My Brother, Who has given over to Me the Imperial Throne of All the Russias at a time of unprecedented warfare and popular disturbances. Inspired by the thought, which is shared by all the people, that the good of our native land is above everything else, I have taken a firm decision to assume the Supreme Power only in the event that such is the will of our great people, upon whom it devolves by a general vote, through their representatives in the Constituent Assembly, to determine the form of government and the new fundamental laws of the Russian State.` - The Russian Provisional Government, 1917: Documents, Volumes I-III, Robert P. Browder & Aleksandr Fyodorovich Kerensky, 1961
- The Provisional Government wanted Russia to continue to be involved in World War I, much to the dismay of the Petrograd Soviets.
    - `The February Revolution produced a surge of patriotism and a renewed determination across a wide swathe of society to defend the Revolution against German militarism. This mood was reflected in the Petrograd Soviet’s policy on bringing an end to the war, a policy crafted by the Georgian Menshevik I. Tsereteli, and published as a proclamation ‘To the Peoples of the World’ on 14 March. Although it called for the army to defend the Revolution, its ‘revolutionary defencism’ was more radical than that of the Workers’ Group of the War Industries Committees insofar as its accent was very much on internationalism and on the achievement of a peace without territorial annexations or the imposition of indemnities.` - Russia in revolution: an Empire in crisis, 1890 to 1928, Steven Antony Smith, 2017
- The Bolsheviks, lead by Lenin, took advantage of the commitment to the war to fuel a future second revolution and recognised the agreement between the the Provisional Government and the Petrograd Soviet.
    - `It should be clear from this why our comrades, too, make so many mistakes when putting the question “simply”: Should the Provisional Government be overthrown immediately? My answer is: (1) it should be overthrown, for it is an oligarchic, bourgeois, and not a people’s government, and is unable to provide peace, bread, or full freedom; (2) It cannot be overthrown just now, for it is being kept in power by a direct and indirect, a formal and actual agreement with the Soviets of Workers’ Deputies, and primarily with the chief Soviet, the Petrograd Soviet; (3) generally, it can not be “overthrown” in the ordinary way, for it rests on the “support” given to the bourgeoisie by the second government—the Soviet of Workers’ Deputies, and that government is the only possible revolutionary government, which directly expresses the mind and will of the majority of the workers and peasants. Humanity has not yet evolved and we do not as yet know a type of government superior to and better than the Soviets of Workers’, Agricultural Labourers’, Peasants’, and Soldiers’ Deputies.` - [The Dual Power, Vladimir Lenin, 1917](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/apr/09.htm)
