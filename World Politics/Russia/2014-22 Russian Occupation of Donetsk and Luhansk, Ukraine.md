## 2014-22 Russian Occupation of Donetsk and Luhansk, Ukraine
- [Russia helped maintain a low intensity conflict from protests](https://www.notion.so/27b787c817dd4ec6b105f068c07e9c03?pvs=21) in the Donbass region leading to Pro-Russian separatist self-proclaimed states forming in Eastern Ukraine.
- Protests were caused by the repealing of Russian of its official language status as a result of the [2014 Russian Annexation of Crimea](https://www.notion.so/27b787c817dd4ec6b105f068c07e9c03?pvs=21) and the [2013-14 Ukrainian Euromaidan Protests](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lHeYAvBKvDX5He9LYD9Za4kFg7vsdF6YQbuge4cKwLQ/edit#heading=h.kiy3903jbuyg) causing unrest.
    - `Protests in Eastern Ukraine against the new Ukrainian government began almost immediately after the Maidan protests prompted Yanukovych’s flight from power. As noted in Chapter Two, the Rada voted to repeal the official status of the Russian language on February 23, stoking fear and anger in the east, where most citizens spoke russian. This measure, coupled with Russia’s operation in Crimea, encouraged the mobilization of both leftist and right-wing organizations in Eastern Ukraine. Their leaders, previously existing on the margins of Ukrainian political life, proclaimed themselves as “people’s mayors” and “people’s governors.”` - [link](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR1400/RR1498/RAND_RR1498.pdf)
- The initial protests across southern and eastern Ukraine were largely native expressions of discontent with the new Ukrainian government but supported by Russian Citizens.
    - `The protesters portrayed their actions as spontaneous and self-initiated, driven by public anxiety about the future after the victory of the Maidan movement in the capital. The Ukrainian government dismissed the outbreak of protests as provocations organized by pro Russian agitators and intelligence operators. Russian intelligence may have played a role in fomenting discontent, but the public agitation and outcry appeared genuine and not disconnected from the country’s political divisions. Some Russian citizens were allegedly paid to cross the border and participate in these events (professional agitators), and some Russians likely came to help the cause of their own accord, but most protestors were local Ukrainians.` - [link](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR1400/RR1498/RAND_RR1498.pdf)
- Fears of Kremlin influence in support of a specific Russian Mayoral candidate for Sevastopol were strengthened after Russian military involvement in those regions.
    - `The opening events of political turmoil in Eastern Ukraine closely followed the popular appointment of a Russian citizen as mayor in Sevastopol, Crimea, on February 24.` - [link](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR1400/RR1498/RAND_RR1498.pdf)
- That then influence made protests become occupations of major administrative buildings with further support pledged from Russia.
    - `An initial surge of activity took place in early March with a series of large demonstrations by mostly unarmed pro-Russian protesters. On March 1, while the Crimean operation was already unfolding, protesters seized the regional administration buildings in Kharkiv and Donetsk. On March 9, protesters took over the regional administration building in Luhansk and demanded a referendum be held on annexing the Luhansk Oblast (region) to Russia. Russian military support for the installment of a new mayor in Sevastopol may have convinced these protesters that they could count on Moscow’s backing. Some suggest that the early protests were somewhat staged. One account described a protest as “street theater,” in which “both sides would show a mix of on-camera resolve, even as they clashed they would knowingly flash moments of politeness, mutual respect, and restraint—as if many of them were a common people caught in their divided rulers’ fight.”`[link](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR1400/RR1498/RAND_RR1498.pdf)
- The Security Service of Ukraine claimed key commanders of the rebel movement during the beginning of the conflict, including Igor Strelkov and Igor Bezler were Russian agents.
    - `With a walrus mustache, a fiery temper and a reputation for brutality, Igor Bezler is the most feared of all the rebel leaders in eastern Ukraine. Nicknamed Bes, or “the Demon”, he is regarded as something of a loose cannon, even by other rebels, who speak about him in hushed tones. If the Ukrainian security services, the SBU, are to be believed, the Demon and a group of his men were responsible for shooting down Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 over the region a fortnight ago.` - [link](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/29/-sp-ukraine-rebel-igor-bezler-interview-demon) [link](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/20/three-pro-russia-rebel-leaders-suspects-over-downed-mh17)
- In late March, Russia built up its military forces near the Ukrainian eastern border, reaching 30–40,000 troops by April. [link](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-usa-military-idUSBREA2R1U720140328) The deployment was likely used to threaten escalation and stymie Ukraine's response to unfolding events.
    - `By March 26, the annexation was essentially complete, and Russia began returning seized military hardware to Ukraine.` - [link](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR1400/RR1498/RAND_RR1498.pdf)
- International propositions have been agreed but then met with disregard by Russian and the self-proclaimed `Donbass` leaders. For example, The Minsk agreements were a series of international agreements which sought to end the war in the Donbas region of Ukraine.
    - The first, known as the Minsk Protocol [link](https://www.osce.org/files/f/documents/a/a/123258.pdf), was drafted in 2014 by the Trilateral Contact Group on Ukraine, consisting of Ukraine, Russia, and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) with mediation by the leaders of France and Germany in the so-called Normandy Format.
    - After extensive talks in Minsk, Belarus, the agreement was signed on 5 September 2014 [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-29299092) by representatives of the Trilateral Contact Group and, without recognition of their status, by the then-leaders of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) and Luhansk People's Republic (LPR).
    - In the two weeks after the Minsk Protocol was signed, there were frequent violations of the ceasefire by both parties to the conflict. Talks continued in Minsk, and a follow-up to the Minsk Protocol [link](http://www.osce.org/ru/home/123807?download=true) was agreed to on 19 September 2014. [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-29290246) This memorandum clarified the implementation of the original Protocol.
    - The agreement failed to stop fighting, and was thus followed with a revised and updated agreement, Minsk II, [link](http://www.osce.org/ru/cio/140221?download=true) [link](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ukraine/11408266/Minsk-agreement-on-Ukraine-crisis-text-in-full.html) which was signed on 12 February 2015. [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-31435812) and the UN adopted a resolution calling for Minsk II agreements. [link](https://www.un.org/press/en/2015/sc11785.doc.htm)
    - Kremlin officials have announced that they are "not a party to the Minsk agreements", and that the agreements were "devoted to two conflicting sides". [link](http://tass.ru/en/politics/865384) And in 2022, President Putin said that the Minsk agreements "no longer existed" [link](https://tass.com/world/1408591)
- This continues with further pressure from Russia in the [2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lHeYAvBKvDX5He9LYD9Za4kFg7vsdF6YQbuge4cKwLQ/edit#heading=h.ag7b4h5sw26l) and the [2022 Russian Annexation of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson & Zaporizhzhia Oblasts](https://www.notion.so/27b787c817dd4ec6b105f068c07e9c03?pvs=21).
