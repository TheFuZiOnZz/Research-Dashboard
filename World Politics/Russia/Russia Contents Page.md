Here’s what Smith wrote via email: “My PhD which became my first book - Red Petrogard - derives from my wrestling with the libertarian critique of Bolshevism. In key respects, my research - and I genuinely had an open mind - showed that Brinton and Avrich fundamentally misunderstood the factory committees, which only very belatedly began to dabble with ideas of worker self-management (being overwhelmingly concerned with not letting workers bear the cost of the implosion of the war economy in 1917). More importantly I showed - as Goodey had suggested, but not really worked through - that the committees were seeking to centralise their activities with a view to being the directing centre of something like a planned economy, but one rooted in workers’ power. I also showed that Lenin - for a few months, until the scale of the collapse of the economy hit him - was broadly sympathetic to the concept of workers’ control. The far left uses Red Petrograd to show (correctly) how quickly the factory committee movement in Petrograd rallied around the Bolshevik cause. What they ignore is that the Bolshevik leaders showed scant interest in the factory committees until after October (...)”)

### Notes

- Bukharin identifies the next stage in economic development as “state capitalism”
- Lenin says state need a monopoly on capitalism to transition to socialism
- Many people claiming to be Marxist-Leninists don’t read the works of their idolized authors when they try to argue with leftcoms and anarchists denying the existence of state capitalism
- Many MLs don’t seem to know many of the bureaucrats never said their state was communist— only transitioning to communism
- On Soviet industrialisation and economy, R.W. Davies has done pioneering work (books are from 1980 to 2018!), especially with his series (partly with Stephen Wheatcroft)
