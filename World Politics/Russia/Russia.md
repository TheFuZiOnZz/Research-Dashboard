### 1930-33 Asharshylyk Famine
- In 1931 to 1933, the then, Kazakh SSR, and now Republic of Kazakhstan, experienced a famine. [link](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/event/the-kazakh-famine-1930-33-and-the-politics-history-the-post-soviet-space) [link](http://web.archive.org/web/20140605055813/https://eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/pp122907.shtml)
- While these famines hit the Volga, the Don, the Urals, Russia, the Cascus and Ukraine hard, Soviet bureaucrats completely upended the Kazakh traditional ways of life.
    - `This peculiar frontier society, which was struggling to emerge from the upheavals of 1916-1922, was struck by a second crisis in 1928. The events were characterized not only by the grain requisition crisis but also by a more generalized assault on the Kazakh way of life. This was a campaign to eliminate traditional authority, with the intent to incorporate the Kazakhs into the state governed from Moscow.` - [The Collectivization Famine in Kazakhstan, 1931–1933, Niccolò Pianciola, 2001](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.2307/41036834)
- Kazakhs lost a greater percentage of their population due to famine than any other ethnic groups.
    - `the number of Kazakh deaths directly attributable to the famine of 1931-1933 was 1,450,000, or approximately 38 percent of the total population, the highest percentage of any nationality in the USSR.` - [The Collectivization Famine in Kazakhstan, 1931–1933, Niccolò Pianciola, 2001](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.2307/41036834)
- Many of the techniques used during the Ukrainian famines and the Great Terror in the Soviet Union were first experimented in Kazakhstan and Central Asia.
    - `in many respects the Kazakh famine was more destructive than the Ukrainian famine, as the Kazakh famine brought about a cultural transformation, the loss of Kazakhs’ nomadic way of life, which was even more far-reaching than that endured by the Ukrainians.` - The Hungry Steppe: Famine, Violence, and the Making of Soviet Kazakhstan, Sarah Cameron
- Famines in the east differ from the west in that, collectivization was war against the peasants, but in the east, forcing nomadic peoples to become sedentary.
    - `The result would be threefold: there would be more draft animals for farm work; there would be a decrease in the number of animals the Kazaks owned, a source of continual conflicts with the peasants over pasture rights, herds ruining the peasants’ fields, etc.; the Kazaks would be forced to abandon nomadic animal herding, an economic form that was not highly productive for the state. The impoverished Kazaks would want to be “sedentarized,” they would till previously uncultivated land, or could be sent to work in mines and on industrial construction sites, or as was more likely, they would simply flee the district and become refugees and the problem they represented for the official who headed the district would be resolved.` - [Famine in the steppe: The collectivization of agriculture and the Kazak herdsmen 1928-1934, Niccolò Pianciola, 2004](https://journals.openedition.org/monderusse/8681)
- Agrarian socialists who advocated for preserving Kazakhs' communalism were purged by Stalin.
    - `The OGPU did not just deport 'enemies' or send them to camps, it also shot them. According to OGPU data, approximately 20,000 people were shot by the OGPU in 1930 and about 11,000 in 1931.` - [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.2307/30043925)
- Moscow criminalizes transnational migrations which forced people to settle in drought-prone area. Russian settler-colonialism forced Kazakhs to change their migration routes and increased dependency on trading for grains.
    - `They also quote a writer who referred to the famine in Ukraine as 'genocide', although they prefer to use the term to apply also to Kazakhstan and Russia. Their article stresses Stalin's use of harsh measures (e.g. forbidding migration from the most affected regions) and repression (arrest, deportation) against the peasantry.` - [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.2307/30043925)
- Many Kazakhs sold their livestock to fulfill grain procurement, especially when the state demanded them to meet the quotas in the form of grains. Often the only place to get grains is by trading with European settlers.
    - `During the NEP, after the disruptions of the 1916-1922 period, the economic relations between herdsmen and peasants were significant: the European peasants sold grain to the Kazaks, who bartered for or bought the grain by selling animals and products from animal rearing to the same European peasants, both at fairs and in the cities` - [link](https://journals.openedition.org/monderusse/8681)
- To force grain production, Soviet Union made slaughters of livestock in the winter illegal and forced meat animals to become draft livestock.
    - `According to the Stalinists, the peasants, who underfulfilled their procurement quotas and required the state to devote great efforts to procurement activities, were thereby guilty of major crimes: 'sabotage' and 'waging war against Soviet power'` - [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.2307/30043925)
- Moscow’s obsession with grain procurements led to a 90% decline in herds.
    - `The number of head of livestock in Kazakstan had therefore fallen by approximately 90% between 1928 and 1934, but for the areas inhabited by nomads and semi-nomads the figure was 97.5%.` - [link](https://journals.openedition.org/monderusse/8681)
- Attempts to centralize livestock production led to epidemic outbreaks, killing many of the animals.
    - `In Kazakhstan, thirty-one districts out of slightly less than 200 were eventually blacklisted. It is unclear, however, how many of these Kazakhstan districts were agricultural districts inhabited by Russian or Ukrainian grain-growers. These measures were implemented shortly after Moscow had acknowledged the almost complete disappearance of Kazakh livestock, exempted the Kazakhs from meat procurements for two years, and de facto privatized all the livestock that remained in Kazakhs’ hands.` - [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1080/14623528.2020.1807140)
- Kazakhs depended on animals for everything from transportation to subsistence to clothing to housing.
    - `In the Soviet Union in the late 1920s the principal peoples whose subsistence depended on transhumant-nomadic animal herding were the Kazaks, Turkmen, Kirghizes and Buriat Mongols` - [link](https://journals.openedition.org/monderusse/8681)
- Stalin's vision of nationalism and ethnic tensions caused other republics to turn away Kazakh refugees.
    - `In July 1929 the committee of the Alma-Ata okrug approved a resolution which proclaimed the importance of agricultural colonization for bringing “free” farmland into cultivation. The governorship’s committee warned about an increase in ethnic tensions, expected to be a consequence of the changes in immigration policy.` - [link](https://journals.openedition.org/monderusse/8681)
- USSR forcibly settled millions of European peasants to 'special villages' to colonize, complimenting the colonial GULAG system. Many of the Kazakhs were forcibly displaced to make room for labour camps and deported peasants from Europe. These resettled peasants fared better during the famine than the nomads.
    - `The last point is an important one, and it raises some of the key methodological differences between researching the Kazakh famine and some of the other crimes of the Stalinist regime, such as the Gulag system, the special settler system, or even the Ukrainian famine. In the Kazakh famine, a far greater percentage of those who suffered were illiterate, and some of the sources that historians typically rely on to get at the ground-level perspective, such as petitions, are much more difficult to find. In the case of the Ukrainian famine, there were numerous efforts to collect oral history accounts of the disaster, spurred in part by the congressional investigation into the Ukrainian famine in the 1980s.` - [link](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/bafykbzacecxjoyfwngsqcbqltz4njzrhzwbeufwu2q3kvj2gnbgw7k363c3na?filename=Sarah%20I%20Cameron%20-%20The%20Hungry%20Steppe_%20Famine%2C%20Violence%2C%20and%20the%20Making%20of%20Soviet%20Kazakhstan-Cornell%20University%20Press%20%282018%29.pdf)
- Famine reconfigured kinship and clan relations from one of mutual aid and interdependence to a capitalist relation
    - `Furthermore the famine can and should be a progressive factor not only economically. It will force the peasant to reflect on the bases of the capitalist system, demolish faith in the tsar and tsarism, and consequently in due course make the victory of the revolution easier` - [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.2307/30043925)

### 1932-33 Holodomor Famine

- In 1932 to 1933, the Ukrainian SSR, and now Ukraine, experienced a famine. This famine was man-made, approximately 3.9 million from this famine. [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20210205060416/http://old.mfa.gov.ua/mediafiles/files/misc/2017-11-01/legal03a.pdf)
- The overwhelming majority of dead were Ukrainians. [link](https://zn.ua/ukr/SOCIUM/skilki_nas_zaginulo_pid_golodomoru_1933_roku.html) but Kazakhs were also amongst those who died during the [1931-33 Kazakh famine](https://www.notion.so/27b787c817dd4ec6b105f068c07e9c03?pvs=21). The consequences are evident in demographic statistics: between 1926 and 1939, the Ukrainian population increased by only 6.6%, whereas Russia and Belarus grew by 16.9% and 11.7%, respectively. [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20110706211443/http://datalib.chass.utoronto.ca/codebooks/utm/ussr_1939.htm) [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20120119190805/http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/sng_nac_39.php?reg=2)
- Stalin knew a famine was going on and either exacerbated it or abetted it with his policies.
    - `The Great Famine (Holodomor) of 1932–33 – a man-made demographic catastrophe unprecedented in peacetime. Of the estimated six to eight million people who died in the Soviet Union, about four to five million were Ukrainians ... Its deliberate nature is underscored by the fact that no physical basis for famine existed in Ukraine ... Soviet authorities set requisition quotas for Ukraine at an impossibly high level. Brigades of special agents were dispatched to Ukraine to assist in procurement, and homes were routinely searched and foodstuffs confiscated ... The rural population was left with insufficient food to feed itself.` - [link](https://www.britannica.com/place/Ukraine/History#ref404577)
- Collectivization and Grain production quotas were imposed on Farmers and these quotas endured into the famine. Failure to meet quotas was punished by being blocked from participation in the general economy seizure of other known green foods as tax or outright execution.
    - `Soviet authorities set requisition quotas for Ukraine at an impossibly high level. Brigades of special agents were dispatched to Ukraine to assist in procurement, and homes were routinely searched and foodstuffs confiscated ... The rural population was left with insufficient food to feed itself.` - [link](https://www.britannica.com/place/Ukraine/History#ref404577)
- The USSR knew of the famine and its scope but continued to export grain anyway.
    - `But grain was still the most lucrative export, especially since the timber trade had run into trouble; reports (which were accurate) that convict labour produced Soviet timber had led to calls for boycotts in a number of Western countries. The level of grain exports duly rose throughout the 1920s` - [link](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/bafykbzacec66wyd452m2ymowu3jb2wzzijw6y4tbvpw6jai46tnfyd6z77u5s?filename=Anne%20Applebaum%20-%20Red%20Famine_%20Stalin%E2%80%99s%20War%20on%20Ukraine-Penguin%20%282017%29.pdf)
- The USSR did not release food reserves.
    - `Soviet records show that in January of 1933, there were enough grain reserves in the USSR to feed well over 10 million people.` - [link](https://cla.umn.edu/chgs/holocaust-genocide-education/resource-guides/holodomor)
- The USSR knew of the famine but still were forbidding emigration from Ukraine and emigration within Ukraine from rural areas to urban areas.
    - `Desertion of factories combined with peasants' flight from kolkhozy so that millions of people moved around the country seeking better conditions. In response the regime revived the tsarist institution of internal passports at the end of 1932.` - [link](https://sci-hub.se/10.2307/2500600) [p86-87]
- The USSR actively suppressed information about the famine, in contrast with the 1921 famine, which did little to spur outside humanitarian assistance.
    - `In spite of the fact that the birth and death records (metrychni knyhy) were for the most part destroyed by order of the GPU, and that information about the causes and scale of death has been falsified, some registry books for 1932-1933 have nevertheless survived` - [link](https://sci-hub.se/https://www.jstor.org/stable/41036832)
- Evidence of widespread cannibalism was documented during the Holodomor because of the famine.
    - `Survival was a moral as well as a physical struggle. A woman doctor wrote to a friend in June 1933 that she had not yet become a cannibal, but was "not sure that I shall not be one by the time my letter reaches you." The good people died first. Those who refused to steal or to prostitute themselves died. Those who gave food to others died. Those who refused to eat corpses died. Those who refused to kill their fellow man died. Parents who resisted cannibalism died before their children did.`
    - `In the villages smoke coming from a cottage chimney was a suspicious sign, since it tended to mean that cannibals were eating a kill or that families were roasting one of their members. Police would follow the smoke and make arrests. At least 2,505 people were sentenced for cannibalism in the years 1932 and 1933 in Ukraine, though the actual number of cases was certainly much greater.` - [link](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/bafykbzaceccblw5ub3z5dqoqr5pbwybapejk3bv2ppkfsemkk7ooi7lhrjfcm?filename=Timothy%20Snyder%20-%20Bloodlands_%20Europe%20between%20Hitler%20and%20Stalin-Basic%20Books%20%282010%29.pdf)
- Genocide Question - Professor of law and coiner of the term "genocide" Raphael Lemkin states that the famine was man-made and the Holodomor was a genocide. In his 1953 article "Soviet Genocide in Ukraine", which he presented as a speech in New York City, he states that the Holodomor was the "third prong" of Soviet "Russification" of Ukraine.
    - `What I want to speak about is perhaps the classic example of Soviet genocide, its longest and broadest experiment in Russification — the destruction of the Ukrainian nation. [....] The third prong of the Soviet plan was aimed at the farmers, the large mass of independent peasants who are the repository of the tradition, folklore and music, the national language and literature, the national spirit, of Ukraine. [....] As a Soviet politician Kosior declared in Izvestiia on 2 December 1933, ‘Ukrainian nationalism is our chief danger’, and it was to eliminate that nationalism, to establish the horrifying uniformity of the Soviet state that the Ukrainian peasantry was sacrificed. [....] The crop that year was ample to feed the people and livestock of Ukraine, though it had fallen off somewhat from the previous year, a decrease probably due in large measure to the struggle over collectivization. But a famine was necessary for the Soviet and so they got one to order, by plan, through an unusually high grain allotment to the state as taxes.` - [link](https://education.holodomor.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/LEMKIN-UN-SPEECH-FULL%E2%80%93Holodomor_PartIV_Friesens.pdf)
- Drought claim - The famine was not the result of a bad drought.
    - `There were droughts in 1931 and in 1934 but not in 1932. In February 1932 Molotov officially acknowledged that the 1931 drought in the Volga Basin, Western Siberia, and Kazakhstan had damaged the grain crop. No such acknowledgement was made in connection with any drought that may have affected Ukraine in 1932.` - [link](https://fcpp.org/wp-content/uploads/Investigation_of_the_Ukrainian_Famine_1932-1933_report_to_Congress.pdf)
- Soviet Denial - In the Soviet Union, authorities all but banned discussion of the famine, and Ukrainian historian Stanislav Kulchytsky stated the Soviet government ordered him to falsify his findings and depict the famine as an unavoidable natural disaster, to absolve the Communist Party and uphold the legacy of Stalin. [link](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/16/world/europe/16kiev.html?_r=4&scp=1&sq=holodomor&st=cse&)
- Global recognition - In a United Nation address from multiple countries
    - `In the former Soviet Union millions of men, women and children fell victims to the cruel actions and policies of the totalitarian regime. The Great Famine of 1932–1933 in Ukraine (Holodomor), which took from 7 million to 10 million innocent lives and became a national tragedy for the Ukrainian people. [...] [A]s a result of civil war and forced collectivization, leaving deep scars in the consciousness of future generations. [...] [W]e deplore the acts and policies that brought about mass starvation and death of millions of people. We do not want to settle scores with the past, it could not be changed, but we are convinced that exposing violations of human rights, preserving historical records and restoring the dignity of victims through acknowledgement of their suffering, will guide future societies and help to avoid similar catastrophes in the future.` - [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20170313040724/http://repository.un.org/bitstream/handle/11176/246001/A_C.3_58_9-EN.pdf)

- [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalin%27s_shooting_lists)
- [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_Operation_of_the_NKVD)
- The Great Purge or the Great Terror was Soviet General Secretary Joseph Stalin's campaign to solidify his power over the party and the state; the purges were also designed to remove the remaining influence of Leon Trotsky as well as other prominent political rivals within the party. It occurred from August 1936 to March 1938.
    - `also called purge trials, three widely publicized show trials and a series of closed, unpublicized trials held in the Soviet Union during the late 1930s, in which many prominent Old Bolsheviks were found guilty of treason and executed or imprisoned. All the evidence presented in court was derived from preliminary examinations of the defendants and from their confessions. It was subsequently established that the accused were innocent, that the cases were fabricated by the secret police (NKVD), and that the confessions were made under pressure of intensive torture and intimidation.` - [link](https://www.britannica.com/event/Great-Purge)
- Estimates of death count for this time was between 700,000 and 2.5 million people
    - `In this period, thousands of people - party members, specialists, army officers, as well as workers and peasants - were shot or interned in labor camps. We do not know exactly how many people were victims of these repressive measures. According to latest estimates 2,5 million people were arrested and 700,000 of them shot` - [link](https://sci-hub.mksa.top/10.2307/20171081)

### 1939 Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact

- On 23 August 1939, the Nazis and the Soviets signed the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact at the Kremlin, which served publicly as a non-aggression pact and secretly divided the nations of Eastern Europe, including Poland, Finland, the Baltic states, and Romania, into two spheres of interest, one belonging to the Soviets and the other to the Nazis.
    
    > `The Government of the German Reich and the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics desirous of strengthening the cause of peace between Germany and the U.S.S.R and proceeding from the fundamental provisions of the Neutrality Agreement concluded in April 1926 between Germany and the U.S.S.R., have reached the following agreement:
    
    ARTICLE I
    
    Both High Contracting Parties obligate, themselves to desist from any act of violence, any aggressive action, and any attack on each other, either individually or jointly with other powers.
    
    ARTICLE II
    
    Should one of the High Contracting Parties become the object of belligerent action by a third power, the other High Contracting Party shall in no manner lend its support to this third power.
    
    ARTICLE III
    
    The Governments of the two High Contracting Parties shall in the future maintain continual contact with one another for the purpose of consultation in order to exchange information on problems affecting their common interests.
    
    ARTICLE IV
    
    Neither of the two High Contracting Parties shall participate in any grouping of powers whatsoever that is directly or indirectly aimed at the other party.
    
    ARTICLE V
    
    Should disputes or conflicts arise between the High Contracting Parties over problems of one kind or another, both parties shall settle these disputes or conflicts exclusively through friendly exchange of opinion or, if necessary, through the establishment of arbitration commissions.
    
    ARTICLE VI
    
    The present treaty is concluded for a period of ten years, with the provision that, in so far as one of the High Contracting Parties does not denounce it one year prior to the expiration of this period, the validity of this treaty shall automatically be extended for another five years.
    
    ARTICLE VI
    
    The present treaty shall be ratified within the shortest possible time. The ratifications shall be exchanged in Berlin. The agreement shall enter into force as soon as it is signed.` - [link](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/nonagres.asp) - Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact
    
    > `On the occasion of the signature of the Nonaggression Pact between the German Reich and the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics the undersigned plenipotentiaries of each of the two parties discussed in strictly confidential conversations the question of the boundary of their respective spheres of influence in Eastern Europe. These conversations led to the following conclusions:
    
    1. In the event of a territorial and political rearrangement in the areas belonging to the Baltic States (Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania), the northern boundary of Lithuania shall represent the boundary of the spheres of influence of Germany and the U.S.S.R. In this connection the interest of Lithuania in the Vilna area is recognized by each party.
        
    2. In the event of a territorial and political rearrangement of the areas belonging to the Polish state the spheres of influence of Germany and the U.S.S.R. shall be bounded approximately by the line of the rivers Narew, Vistula, and San.
        
    
    The question of whether the interests of both parties make desirable the maintenance of an independent Polish state and how such a state should be bounded can only be definitely determined in the course of further political developments.
    
    In any event both Governments will resolve this question by means of a friendly agreement.
    
    With regard to Southeastern Europe attention is called by the Soviet side to its interest in Bessarabia. The German side declares; its complete political disinterestedness in these areas.
    
    This protocol shall be treated by both parties as strictly secret.` - [link](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/addsepro.asp) - Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact: Secret Additional Protocol
    
- Stalin was aware months before the Pact was signed of Hitler’s intentions with Poland.
    
    > `Stalin was in a difficult position in 1939. Over the previous few years he had carried out violent purges of his top generals, munitions factory managers and senior army officers. There were few left in the higher echelons of the regime with any direct experience of warfare. Competent technical experts had been arrested and killed in their thousands. Soviet military preparedness was lamentable. Stalin was aware from June 1939 onwards of Hitler's intention to invade Poland in late August or early September. More than anything else, he needed to ensure that the invasion went no further. He needed time to regroup and rebuild the Red Army, refashion his arms and equipment production, and get ready for the assault he was sure would follow some time after the German conquest of Poland. To some extent, he left open the option of forging an alliance with the Western powers; but they were hesitant, regarding him as unreliable, and Ribbentrop and the German Foreign Office were eager, despite Hitler's own personal reservations. As the hints from Moscow grew stronger, Ribbentrop saw an opportunity to shock the British, whom he still hated intensely after the humiliations of his time as ambassador in London, and deliver a coup that would win Hitler's undying gratitude and approval.` - [link] - The Third Reich in Power, 1933-1939: How the Nazis Won Over the Hearts and Minds of a Nation, Richard Evans
    
- On 28 September 1939, after the Nazi & Soviet Invasion of Poland, The `German–Soviet Boundary and Friendship Treaty` - [link](http://www.ibiblio.org/pha/nsr/nsr-03.html#32) was a second supplementary protocol of the Pact that was modified giving the Nazi’s a bigger part of Poland, while giving most of Lithuania to the Soviets.
    
    > `Eleven days later, the arrangement under the secret protocols was modified. Germany was allotted a larger part of Poland, while most of Lithuania was added to Moscow's "sphere of influence." Leaving all of central Poland to the Germans, Stalin gave credence to his claim that he simply wanted to recuperate previous territory up to the "Curzon line", which was alleged to be Russia's "ethnic frontier."` - [link](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafykbzaced4ims4h6i4i4ghuont2geechnvrmxxuhgekzpo34ph45njuzb7t4?filename=%28Harvard%20Cold%20War%20Studies%29%20Gerhard%20Wettig%20-%20Stalin%20and%20the%20Cold%20War%20in%20Europe_%20The%20Emergence%20and%20Development%20of%20East-West%20Conflict%2C%201939-1953-Rowman%20%26%20Littlefield%20Publishers%20%282007%29.pdf)
    
    > `During the course of further negotiations. intent on taking possession of Lithuania which he (Stalin) had previously offered to Hitler. he agreed in exchange to move the demarcation line back from the Vistula and San rivers to the Bug and the San.

Polish specialists claim up to 3000 killed and 8000-10000 wounded as well as the destruction of 100 Soviet tanks and armoured cars. Polish military deaths are variously estimated at between 3000 and 7000, with 20000 wounded. An additional thousand to 2500 were executed or murdered in immediate reprisals by both Soviet and harassing Ukrainian nationalist forces.` - [link](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafykbzaceb246lkh7efv5wypd3qojdxndtxluifuuhlnbohko74y76k2exsv6?filename=George%20Sanford%20-%20Katyn%20and%20the%20Soviet%20Massacre%20of%201940_%20Truth%2C%20Justice%20and%20Memory%20%28BASEES%20Routledge%20Series%20on%20Russian%20and%20East%20European%20Studies%29%20%20-Routledge%20%282005%29.pdf)
    

### 1939 German-Soviet Military Parade in Brest-Litovsk

- [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German%E2%80%93Soviet_military_parade_in_Brest-Litovsk)
- On 22 September 1939, The German–Soviet military parade in Brest-Litovsk was an official ceremony held by the troops of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union during the invasion of Poland in the city of Brest-Litovsk. It marked the withdrawal of German troops to the demarcation line secretly agreed to in the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, and the handover of the city and its fortress to the Soviet Red Army.

## 1939 Invasion of Finland, Winter War

- In November 30 1939, under the auspices of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, the Soviet Union invaded Finland.
- The Finnish defensive effort defied Soviet expectations, and after stiff losses, as well as the unsuccessful attempt to install a puppet government in Helsinki, Stalin settled for an interim peace granting the Soviet Union parts of Karelia and Salla (9% of Finnish territory).
    - `` - [link]
- Soviet official casualty counts in the war exceeded 200,000, while Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev later claimed the casualties may have been one million.
    - `` - [link]
- After this campaign, Stalin took actions to modify training and improve propaganda efforts in the Soviet military.
    - `` - [link]
- On December 14 1939, The Soviet Union is expelled from the League of Nations in response to the Soviet invasion of Finland.
    - `The lawless character of the achievement was perceived in nearly every foreign quarter. Russia's contempt for its numerous and well-defined treaty obligations towards its victim, as well as towards the League of Nations, was duly appraised and speedily condemned at Geneva.` ... `2. See Report of the Assembly, provided for in Art. 15, paragraphs 4 and 10, of the Covenant, submitted by the Special Committee of the Assembly, Dec. 13, 1939, League of Nations Official Journal, November-December, 1939, p. 531; also resolution adopted by the Council, Dec. 14, 1939, finding that by its act the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics had "placed itself outside the League of Nations," and declaring that it followed that that country was "no longer a member of the League."

## 1940-44 Soviet, Then Nazi, Then Soviet Occupation of the Baltic States

- On 15 & 16 June 1940, under the auspices of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, The Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were extorted with having military bases on their territories, then later invaded and occupied by the Soviet Union.
    
    > `The independent functioning of the Baltic States was interrupted in June 1940 when, after the conclusion of the Treaty of Non-Aggression between Germany and the USSR of 23 August 1939 (Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact) and its Secret Additional Protocols, Soviet troops occupied the territories of the Baltic States.` - [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1163/221158903x00072)
    
    > `The experience of the first year of Soviet occupation saw Russians replace Baltic Germans and Poles as the most feared and disliked minority in the region. The pattern of takeover was similar in all three states. The first Soviet occupation followed the 23 August 1939 signing of the secret protocols of the Molotov–Ribbentrop pact, which sliced Eastern Europe into two spheres of influence. Estonia, Latvia and eventually Lithuania fell into the Soviet sphere. The Soviet Union then claimed to be threatened by the Baltic states, demanded that ‘mutual assistance agreements’ be signed, and then moved troops and political advisors into the three states (25,000 each in Estonia and Latvia). This was followed in 1940 by Soviet claims that the terms of the treaties had been broken, leading to more troops crossing the borders, to the forced dismissal of the acting cabinets and to new, hand-picked Soviet governments. As Soviet officials took hold of the region, each Baltic state held visibly falsified elections, followed by the coming to power of Soviet-friendly puppet governments. In August 1940 the newly elected Baltic legislatures sent delegates to Moscow to successfully apply for membership in the Soviet Union.` - [link](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/bafykbzaceay4daq6ol2nc5jsm52fmjzxyptudoad3thqdqcd3rbmqc6k43bya?filename=Daunis%20Auers%20-%20Comparative%20Politics%20and%20Government%20of%20the%20Baltic%20States_%20Estonia%2C%20Latvia%20and%20Lithuania%20in%20the%2021st%20Century-Palgrave%20Macmillan%20UK%20%282015%29.pdf)
    
- On 3-6 August 1940, after planning an installation of a pro-soviet puppet government in the Baltic States and ultimatums from the Soviets to the Baltic States, The three countries were then annexed into the Soviet Union as constituent republics.
    
    > `More sinister intentions are, however, suggested by evidence from the archives of the former government of Latvia which have recently been opened to Latvian scholars. It now appears that as early as December 1939 the Soviets were hoping to be able to take control of Latvia by exploiting left-wing and bourgeois elements in a pretence of a popular front government. The model was the puppet government set up at Terijoki under the Finnish communist Otto Kuusinen on 30 November 1939, the day that the Red Army invaded Finland.` - [link](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafykbzacedbyqrfvngivgnrqouegkxo2y7uct5shvoev2nda4agooeuiyw2lg?filename=Hiden%20John_%20Salmon%20Patrick%20-%20The%20Baltic%20nations%20and%20Europe_%20Estonia%2C%20Latvia%20and%20Lithuania%20in%20the%20twentieth%20century-Longman%20%281994%29.pdf)
    
    > `On 18 July ‘demonstrators’ in the major cities of the Baltic states called for their incorporation in the Soviet Union: three days later all three parliaments declared their countries Soviet republics and applied for membership. The formal incorporation of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia followed between 3 and 6 August 1940.` - [link](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafykbzacedbyqrfvngivgnrqouegkxo2y7uct5shvoev2nda4agooeuiyw2lg?filename=Hiden%20John_%20Salmon%20Patrick%20-%20The%20Baltic%20nations%20and%20Europe_%20Estonia%2C%20Latvia%20and%20Lithuania%20in%20the%20twentieth%20century-Longman%20%281994%29.pdf)
    
- On 22 June 1941, following Operation Barbarossa, the Nazi Germany attacked the Soviet Union and within weeks occupied the Baltic territories and by July 1941, the Third Reich occupied the Baltic territory.
    
    > `In such circumstances it is not surprising that many members of the majority populations of the Baltic countries welcomed the German armed forces when they crossed the frontiers of Lithuania on 22 June 1941 and pressed on into Latvia and Estonia. Since signing the Nazi—Soviet pact the Third Reich had displayed a conspicuous lack of concern for the fate of the three republics. In the autumn of 1939 it initiated the evacuation of the Baltic German populations of Estonia and Latvia, thus bringing to an end 700 years of Baltic German history.` - [link](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafykbzacedbyqrfvngivgnrqouegkxo2y7uct5shvoev2nda4agooeuiyw2lg?filename=Hiden%20John_%20Salmon%20Patrick%20-%20The%20Baltic%20nations%20and%20Europe_%20Estonia%2C%20Latvia%20and%20Lithuania%20in%20the%20twentieth%20century-Longman%20%281994%29.pdf)
    
- On 5 August 1944, the Soviet Union recaptured most of the Baltic states and they, again, were reorganized into constituent republics of the USSR.

- The Baltic states themselves, the United States, the European Parliament and the European Court of Human Rights have all stated that these three countries were invaded, occupied and illegally incorporated into the Soviet Union under provisions of the [Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact](https://www.notion.so/27b787c817dd4ec6b105f068c07e9c03?pvs=21).
    
    > Latvia - `The annexation of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania is fundamentally illegal: it is based on intervention and occupation. That is why the annexation did not elicit juridical consequences. There was no change of sovereign power: the annexed state retained its sovereignty which the annexing state did not acquire. The status of the Baltic States as subjects of international law did not disappear. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania continued to exist de jure and their existence was recognized by 50 countries throughout the world. The non-recognition of the annexation was very important for the Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian nations. It served as the basis for their unceasing demand for the restoration of the independence of their countries.` - [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20071123015238/http://www.am.gov.lv/en/latvia/history/occupation-aspects/)
    
    > Estonia - `On 22 September 1944, units of the Red Army captured Tallinn. Although it was a milestone on the road to Allied victory in Europe, the recapture of Tallinn by Soviet forces was far from being a "liberation" for the Estonian people. It merely marked a change in foreign regimes and the beginning of a nightmarishly repressive occupation that would last for nearly 50 more years. The occupation was never recognized by most Western countries. For Estonia, World War II only ended, de facto, on 31 August 1994, with the final withdrawal of former Soviet troops from Estonian soil.` - [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20080723194014/http://www.estemb.org/estonia/history/aid-775)
    
    > United States - `From Sumner Wells' declaration of July 23, 1940, that we would not recognize the occupation. We housed the exiled Baltic diplomatic delegations. We accredited their diplomats. We flew their flags in the State Department's Hall of Flags. We never recognized in deed or word or symbol the illegal occupation of their lands.` - [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20120819185542/http://merln.ndu.edu/archivepdf/EUR/State/86539.pdf)
    
    > European Parliament - `In the Spring of 1990, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia declared their independence. By the end of the year, all the Republics of the Soviet Union had followed their example. Although the Member States of the Community, along with the majority of Western states, have always refused to recognize the annexation of the Baltic states, they reacted with great caution to the heightening of tension with the central authorities. In the first phase, the Twelve limited themselves to inviting the Soviet authorities to refrain from any act of intimidation, inconformity with Soviet commitments under the Helsinki Final Act and the Charter of Paris. They were also urged to open negotiations with elected representatives of the Baltic Republics ‘in order to meet, through a peaceful solution, the legitimate aspirations of the Baltic peoples’. A similar invitation was made in a letter from the President of the Council, Luxembourg Foreign Minister Poos, to Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze to condemn the use of force by Soviet troops in Vilnius.` - [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1093/oxfordjournals.ejil.a035821)
    
    > European Court of Human Rights - `The Court notes, first, that Estonia lost its independence as a result of the Treaty of Non-Aggression between Germany and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (also known as "Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact"), concluded on 23 August 1939, and the secret additional protocols to it. Following an ultimatum to set up Soviet military bases in Estonia in 1939, a large-scale entry of the Soviet army into Estonia took place in June 1940. The lawful government of the country was overthrown and Soviet rule was imposed by force. The totalitarian communist regime of the Soviet Union conducted large-scale and systematic actions against the Estonian population, including, for example, the deportation of about 10,000 persons on 14 June 1941 and of more than 20,000 on 25 March 1949. After the Second World War, tens of thousands of persons went into hiding in the forests to avoid repression by the Soviet authorities; part of those in hiding actively resisted the occupation regime. According to the data of the security organs, about 1,500 persons were killed and almost 10,000 arrested in the course of the resistance movement of 1944–1953. Interrupted by the German occupation in 1941–1944, Estonia remained occupied by the Soviet Union until its restoration of independence in 1991. Accordingly, Estonia as a state was temporarily prevented from fulfilling its international commitments.` - [link](https://www.stradalex.com/fr/sl_src_publ_jur_int/document/echr_23052-04_001-72404)

- As part of the 1941 Axis invasion of the Soviet Union, Romania regained the territories of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina, and seized a territory which became known as Transnistria Governorate. Romanian forces, working with the Germans, deported or massacred about 300,000 Jews, including 147,000 from Bessarabia and Bukovina. Of the latter, approximately 90,000 died.

## 1940 Katyn Massacre

- [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katyn_massacre)
- The Katyn massacre was a series of mass executions of 22,000 Polish military officers and intelligentsia prisoners of war carried out by the Soviet Union, specifically the NKVD ("People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs", the Soviet secret police) in April and May 1940 as a part of the secret sections of [The Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact](https://www.notion.so/27b787c817dd4ec6b105f068c07e9c03?pvs=21).

See Materski (ed.), pp. 26-28. Shelepin indicates that of the 21,857 Poles executed, 4,421 were executed near Katyn Forest in Smolensk oblast', 3,820 in Starobelsk in Kharkhov oblast', 6,311 in Ostashkov in Kalinin oblast' and 7,305 elsewhere.

## 1940 Tripartite Pact

- The Tripartite Pact, also known as the Berlin Pact, was an agreement between Germany, Italy, and Japan signed in Berlin on 27 September 1940 by, respectively, Joachim von Ribbentrop, Galeazzo Ciano and Saburō Kurusu. It was a defensive military alliance that was eventually joined by Hungary (20 November 1940), Romania (23 November 1940), Bulgaria (1 March 1941) and Yugoslavia (25 March 1941) as well as by the German client state of Slovakia (24 November 1940).
    
- The pact included mention of that its formation that the pact wouldn’t effect Soviet Russia

## 1941 Invasion of the Soviet Union, Operation Barbarossa

- Operation Barbarossa was the invasion of the Soviet Union by Nazi Germany and most of the Axis leaders, starting on 22 June 1941 which made the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact then unofficially terminated and then officially terminated on 30 July 1941 in the Sikorski–Mayski Agreement.
    
- Stalin was caught off but this invasion by the Nazis and thought reports from Soviet agents warning him of a potential invasion were the Nazi’s hard-balling for more economic concessions.
    
    > `For all its multinational trimmings, therefore, ‘Operation Barbarossa’ was thus in essence to be a German operation. As the winter snows of East-Central Europe melted and the ground thawed, the German armed forces began moving vast masses of men and equipment up to the Soviet border. Throughout May and early June 1941, Zygmunt Klukowski recorded endless columns of German troops and vehicles passing through his region of Poland, noting the passage of between 500 and 600 vehicles on 14 June alone, for example. Stalin hurriedly launched a futile policy of trying to appease the Germans by stepping up Soviet deliveries of Asian rubber and other supplies under the trade agreement signed in January 1941. As a dogmatic Marxist-Leninist, Stalin was convinced that Hitler’s regime was the tool of German monopoly capitalism, so that if he made available everything German business wanted, there would be no immediate reason to invade. Already, under trade provisions agreed under the Nazi-Soviet Pact early the previous year, the Soviet Union was supplying nearly threequarters of Germany’s requirement of phosphates, over two-thirds of its imported asbestos, only a little less of its chrome ore, over half its manganese, over a third of its imported nickel, and, even more crucially, more than a third of its imported oil. Stalin personally vetoed proposals to disrupt the German military build-up by attacking across the Polish demarcation line. Reports from Soviet agents and even from members of the German embassy in Moscow that an invasion was imminent only convinced him that the Germans were playing hard-ball in their drive to extract economic concessions from him.` - [link] - The Third Reich at war, Richard Evans
    
- Stalin’s trust in Soviet intelligence agents was low because of the relaying of correct Nazi planned dates that were delayed, and Stalin interpreting that as people pushing him towards preemptive war with Germany and when informed by a deserted Nazi soldier of the what became the true date of the invasion, Stalin had him shot for spreading disinformation.
    
    > `At the same time, Stalin realized that, as he told graduating military cadets in Moscow on 5 May 1941, ‘War with Germany is inevitable.’ Molotov might be able to postpone it for two or three months, but in the meantime it was vital to ‘re-teach our army and our commanders. Educate them in the spirit of attack.’ Delivered to young officers as a rhetorical message for the future, this was not a statement of intent. Stalin did not believe that the Red Army would be ready to deal with the Germans until 1942 or perhaps even 1943. Not only had the General Staff not drawn up any plans for an attack on the German forces, it had no plans for a defence against them either. Although the Germans mounted a large and sophisticated deception plan to conceal the true nature of their intentions, Soviet intelligence began to send in accurate reports that the invasion was planned for around 22 June 1941. But Stalin would not listen. Earlier reports that the invasion plans were to become operational on 15 May 1941, though correct at the time, proved wrong when the Germans delayed Barbarossa in order to mount the invasion of Greece and Yugoslavia. Hitler later blamed Mussolini for the consequences, but in fact the weather in East-Central Europe in these weeks would have made an invasion of the Soviet Union inadvisable even had the German Leader not been obliged to step in to rescue his Italian ally from the imbroglio in Southern Europe. The Soviet agents who had made the prediction lost all credibility as a result. The capitalist forces in Britain, including the exiled Polish government, seemed to Stalin’s narrow and suspicious mind to be feeding false information to him about German intentions in order to lure him into a battle. Surely in any case the German Leader would not invade while the conflict with Britain was still unresolved. When an ex-Communist soldier deserted the German forces on 21 June 1941 and swam across a river to tell the Russians on the other side that his unit had been given orders to invade the following morning, Stalin had him shot for spreading ‘disinformation’.` - [link] - The Third Reich at war, Richard Evans
    
- The Red Army had little time to correct its numerous deficiencies before Nazi Germany and other Axis countries allied with it swept across the newly relocated Soviet border on June 22, 1941, in the opening stages of Operation Barbarossa.
    
    > `The twenty-second of June 1941 is one of the most significant days in the history of Europe. The German invasion of the Soviet Union that began that day under the cryptonym Operation Barbarossa was much more than a surprise attack, a shift of alliances, or a new stage in a war. It was the beginning of a calamity that defies description. The engagement of the Wehrmacht (and its allies) with the Red Army killed more than ten million soldiers, not to speak of the comparable number of civilians who died in flight, under bombs, or of hunger and disease as a result of the war on the eastern front` - [link](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafykbzaceccblw5ub3z5dqoqr5pbwybapejk3bv2ppkfsemkk7ooi7lhrjfcm?filename=Timothy+Snyder+-+Bloodlands_+Europe+between+Hitler+and+Stalin-Basic+Books+%282010%29.pdf) - Bloodlands: Europe between Hitler and Stalin, Timothy Snyder
    
- Hitler thought Stalin was the safer option to side with compared to the Polish.
    
    > `Hitler himself later explained his failure to conclude a new nonaggression pact with Poland by his lack of confidence in the Poles. They were within striking distance of vital industrial areas in eastern Germany and Bohemia, and he believed they would take the first possible opportunity to stab Germany in the back. Stalin, who in Hitlers opinion could not risk a war under any circumstances, was in that respect a safer treaty partner, as well as being several hundred kilometers farther removed from the German border. Once Hitler had convinced himself he could not rely on Poland, he evidently decided Poland would have to eliminated before he took action against the West. Just when he made the decision to attack Poland, however, is difficult to determine.` - [link](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/bafykbzacebi7fvuwrky3v3ggchh6zwcupwfb6on22zaennjlbo3loolhsl5yy?filename=%28Hitler%27s%20War%20Aims%29%20Norman%20Rich%20-%20Hitler%27s%20War%20Aims_%20Ideology%2C%20the%20Nazi%20State%2C%20and%20the%20Course%20of%20Expansion-W.%20W.%20Norton%20%20Company%20%281992%29.pdf) - Hitler's war aims, Norman Rich
    
- Hitler expected the Operation to not take as much time as it did.
    
    > `Operation Barbarossa was supposed to be quick and decisive, bringing a “lightning victory” within three months at the latest.

- During the initial stages of the war, Soviet forces were often ordered to stand their ground despite limited defensive capabilities, resulting in numerous encirclements and correspondingly high numbers of casualties.
    
    > `The organization of the camps in the east revealed a contempt for life, the life of Slavs and Asians and Jews anyway, that made such mass starvation thinkable. In German prisoner-of-war camps for Red Army soldiers, the death rate over the course of the war was 57.5 percent. In the first eight months after Operation Barbarossa, it must have been far higher. In German prisoner-of-war camps for soldiers of the western Allies, the death rate was less than five percent.` - [link](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafykbzaceccblw5ub3z5dqoqr5pbwybapejk3bv2ppkfsemkk7ooi7lhrjfcm?filename=Timothy+Snyder+-+Bloodlands_+Europe+between+Hitler+and+Stalin-Basic+Books+%282010%29.pdf) - Bloodlands: Europe between Hitler and Stalin, Timothy Snyder

## 1941 Sikorski–Mayski Agreement

- On 30 July 1941, The Sikorski–Mayski agreement was a treaty between the Soviet Union and Poland that was signed in London. Its name is taken from its two most notable signatories: the prime minister of Poland, Władysław Sikorski, and the Soviet ambassador to the United Kingdom, Ivan Mayski.
    
- Stalin agreed to declare all previous pacts that he had with Nazi Germany null and void, to invalidate the September 1939 partition of Poland and to release tens of thousands of Polish prisoners-of-war held in Soviet camps. Pursuant to an agreement between the Polish government-in-exile and Stalin, the Soviets granted "amnesty" to many Polish citizens on 12 August 1941.
    
    - `1. The Government of the U.S.S.R. recognizes the Soviet-German treaties of 1939 as to territorial changes in Poland as having lost their validity. The Polish Government declares Poland is not bound by any agreement with any third power which is directed against the U.S.S.R.
    
    2. Diplomatic relations will be restored between the two governments upon the signing of this agreement, and an immediate exchange of Ambassadors will be arranged. The two governments mutually agree to render one to another aid and support of all kinds in the present war against Hitlerite Germany.
        
    3. The Government of the U.S.S.R. expresses its consent to the formation on territory of the U.S.S.R. of a Polish Army under a commander appointed by the Polish Government in agreement with the Soviet Government, the Polish Army on territory of the U.S.S.R. being subordinated in an operational sense to the Supreme Command of the U.S.S.R., in which the Polish Army will be represented. All details as to command, organization and employment of this force will be settled in a subsequent agreement.
        
    4. This agreement will come into force immediately upon signature and without ratification. The present agreement is drawn up in two copies, in the Russian and Polish languages. Both texts have equal force.
        
    
    The Soviet Government grants amnesty to all Polish citizens now detained on Soviet territory either as prisoners of war or on other sufficient grounds, as from the resumption of diplomatic relations.` - [link](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/bafykbzacedk4o3mawvpupcurbvzmdnxqcrs4jybzzc4rnxtj6w77pf7x6pkga?filename=J%C3%B3zef%20Garli%C5%84ski%20%28auth.%29%20-%20Poland%20in%20the%20Second%20World%20War-Palgrave%20Macmillan%20UK%20%281985%29.pdf)
    
- The Soviets broke off talks again in 1943 after the Polish government had demanded an independent examination of the recently discovered [Katyn burial pits](https://www.notion.so/Geo-Politics-8ab38a7f4fb84ec09ae3895794c0539c?pvs=21) by the International Red Cross.
    
    - `Copy of the Soviet Note of April 25, 1943, severing unilaterally Soviet-Polish diplomatic relations. Note served verbally to the Polish Ambassador in Moscow, Tadeusz Romer in response to the Polish Government’s request of April 17, 1943 that the mass burial site of murdered Polish officers, discovered by the Germans in Katyn, be examined by an independent and impartial body - the International Red Cross.` ... `Both, the Polish Government and the Hitlerite government drew into the "investigation" the International Red Cross, compelled to participate in this farce of investigation in which Hitler appears to be the stage manager, in conditions of a terroristic regime with its gallows and mass extermination of the peaceful population. Understandably, such an "investigation", conducted behind the back of the Soviet Government, can not command confidence of people, possessing any degree of honesty.` - [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20050909042329/http://www.electronicmuseum.ca/Poland-WW2/katyn_memorial_wall/kmw_note.html)

### Notes

- While many of the historic crimes were committed during Soviet era, there is a overlap of Stalin apologists in Marxist-Leninist circles and “oppose the west, support the rest” anti-USA far-right reactionaries thus contemporary sources about Tatar persecution under both Ukraine and Russian Federation as continuum from Imperial Russia and USSR is needed
- Some collaborated with fascist Germany but most did not.
- Many were glad at first from the Red Army liberating Crimea from germany
- 20,000 troops sent to punish the entire group for the crimes of a small group
- The NKVD struck all villages at once, quickly forced them out of their homes and deported even those who fought in the front and won awards etc. A third died in the process. People were shocked and didn’t believe that stalin would do this
- Stalin did the same thing to Chechens and kelmiks almost a million people
- Roma (Gypsy) communities that were integrated with Tatars were also deported by the Soviets: “On 18 May 1944 the Soviet authorities, on returning to the Crimea, also composed the trains of the Tatars to be deported based on the German lists, thus including the Gypsies listed as Tatars.”
- “In 1944 Crimean Tatar speaking Gypsies were also deported...They were perceived as Gypsies, which is why they were predetermined for annihilation from the Nazis during World War II but, according to Soviet statistics, they were defined as Tatars and so they were deported by the Soviet authorities, alongside the Crimean Tatars..." from “Gypsies in Central Asia and the Caucasus” by Elena Marushiakova and Vesselin Popov
- By adopting the new language law, Ukraine has implicitly abandoned the idea of returning Crimea

## 1951-53 `Doctors Plot` Affair

- The "doctors' plot" affair was an alleged conspiracy of prominent Soviet medical specialists to murder leading government and party officials. In 1951–1953, a group of predominantly Jewish doctors from Moscow were accused of a conspiracy to assassinate Soviet leaders.
- This was later accompanied by publications of antisemitic character in the media, which talked about the threats of Zionism and condemned people with Jewish surnames. Following this, many doctors, both Jews and non-Jews, were dismissed from their jobs, arrested, and tortured to produce admissions.
    - `A propaganda offensive accompanied the plans to deport—“for their own good”—the Jewish population. One million copies of a pamphlet were prepared for distribution—its title: “Why Jews Must Be Resettled from the Industrial Regions of the Country.” The deportation was purportedly “in response” to a carefully orchestrated letter prepared for Pravda and signed by many terrified Soviet Jewish leaders, imploring “The Father of all the Peoples” to deport the Jews for their own protection.` - [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1136/bmj.325.7378.1487)
- A few weeks after the death of Stalin, the new Soviet leadership said there was a lack of evidence regarding the doctors' plot and the case was dropped. Soon after, it was declared that the case had been a fabrication.
    - `For Stalin, whose deeds easily matched those of Hitler and whose deceits had been evident throughout his life, the Doctors’ Plot and intended show trial were meant to cleanse the Soviet Union of “foreign,” “cosmopolitan,” and “Zionist” (read Jewish) elements. In fact, it was the only one of Stalin’s show trials that did not come off—only because he died just before the spectacle was to begin.` - [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.1136/bmj.325.7378.1487)
- In his 1956 "Secret Speech", First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev stated that the doctors' plot was "fabricated... set up by Stalin," but that Stalin did not "have the time in which to bring it to an end," which saved the doctors' lives. Khrushchev also told the session that Stalin called the judge in the case and, regarding the methods to be used, stated "beat, beat and, beat again.” Stalin supposedly told his Minister of State Security, "If you do not obtain confessions from the doctors we will shorten you by a head." According to Khrushchev, Stalin told Politburo members, "You are blind like young kittens. What will happen without me? The country will perish because you do not know how to recognize enemies.” [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20051107221432/http://www.uwm.edu/Course/448-343/index12.html)

# 1953-64 Nikita Khrushchev

## 1954 Transfer of Crimea

- In 1954, the Crimean Oblast was incorporated into the Ukrainian SSR following administrative action of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. The action was attributed to Nikita Khrushchev, then-First Secretary of the Communist Party.
    - `The agenda of the session of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which took place January 25, 1954, contained a question about the delivery of the Crimean region to the structure of the Ukrainian SSR. The discussion of the question took only 15 minutes. The participants of the meeting approved the decree, and the region was given away to Ukraine for free. Not a single protest was made; no one had any doubts about the decision. No one wondered how the population (presumably the Russian-speaking population) of Crimea would treat the decision. It turned out that such important issues as the territorial movement of regions could be solved without any difficulties at all.` - [link](https://english.pravda.ru/history/107129-ussr_crimea_ukraine/)
- On 20 February 2014, during a visit to Moscow, Chairman of the Supreme Council of Crimea Vladimir Konstantinov stated that the 1954 transfer of Crimea from the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic had been a mistake.

## 1955 Creation of the Warsaw Pact

- In 14 May 1955, while West Germany joins NATO, the USSR responds by creating the Warsaw Pact, a military alliance between the countries of Eastern Europe including Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland and Romania.
    - `As the exercise of power in Moscow became progressively diluted since its Stalinist peak, the alliance originally devised by Khrushchev with the goal of outcompeting NATO offered to the Soviet dependents in Eastern Europe growing room for pursuing their own interests, jointly or separately, with or sometimes against their master – to those among them, to be sure, who cared and dared to avail themselves of the opportunity` - [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/10.4324/9781315732541)

## 1956-66 Sino-Soviet Split

- The Sino-Soviet split was the breaking of political relations between the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union caused by doctrinal divergences that arose from their different interpretations and practical applications of Marxism–Leninism, as influenced by their respective geopolitics during the Cold War of 1945–1991.

### 1956 Khrushchev's Secret Speech

- "On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences" popularly known as the "Secret Speech", was a report by Nikita Khrushchev, made to the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) on 25 February 1956. Khrushchev charged Stalin with having created a leadership cult of personality despite maintaining support for the ideals of communism.
    - `Comrades! We must abolish the cult of the individual decisively, once and for all; we must draw the proper conclusions concerning both ideological-theoretical and practical work.` - [link](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafykbzacecbfp53uqbfrgwo2c5l3oqr2relj2ajjfu6e2b6va4t6lwuhh5que?filename=Nikita%20S.%20Khrushchev%20-%20The%20Crimes%20of%20the%20Stalin%20Era_%20Special%20Report%20to%20the%2020th%20Congress%20of%20the%20Communist%20Party%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union-The%20New%20Leader%20%281956%29.pdf)
- In 1956, Sino-Soviet relations began deteriorating due to the Secret Speech as Mao’s China was built on the same principles as Stalin’s Russia.
    - `The Secret Speech had immediate repercussions inside and outside of the Soviet Union. Even before its official distribution to all CPSU members on March 5, the report had been circulated within the party and then quickly beyond.` - [link](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafykbzaced4sn3i7kz7dz5ye7tlwvaj2zlb5xuiooyj47rxobfcxtahuci2vy?filename=%28Princeton%20Studies%20in%20International%20History%20and%20Politics%29%20Lorenz%20M.%20L%C3%BCthi%20-%20The%20Sino-Soviet%20Split_%20Cold%20War%20in%20the%20Communist%20World-Princeton%20University%20Press%20%282008%29.pdf)
- In light of this `de-Stalinization`, the CPSU's changed ideological orientation posed problems of ideological credibility and political authority for Mao, who had emulated Stalin's style of leadership and practical application of Marxism–Leninism in the development of Socialism with Chinese characteristics and the PRC as a country.
    - `To understand the Chinese reaction to the twentieth CPSU congress, it is important to recall developments in China’s domestic politics. The failure of the Socialist High Tide began to reveal itself in the spring of 1956. The policy had many of the characteristics of Stalin’s bungled collectivization campaign. Khrushchev’s criticism of Stalin’s crimes was an unintended assessment of Mao’s recent mistakes. The Secret Speech had not been totally unexpected. Since 1953, the ambassador in Moscow, Zhang Wentian, had written numerous reports on subtle changes in Soviet positions on Stalin. The Chinese leaders had also started to work out their own criticism.` - [link](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafykbzaced4sn3i7kz7dz5ye7tlwvaj2zlb5xuiooyj47rxobfcxtahuci2vy?filename=%28Princeton%20Studies%20in%20International%20History%20and%20Politics%29%20Lorenz%20M.%20L%C3%BCthi%20-%20The%20Sino-Soviet%20Split_%20Cold%20War%20in%20the%20Communist%20World-Princeton%20University%20Press%20%282008%29.pdf)

### 1956-57 Mao's Hundred Flowers Campaign

- The Hundred Flowers Campaign, was a period from 1956 to 1957 in the People's Republic of China during which the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) encouraged citizens to openly express their opinions of the Communist Party. However, the campaign proved too successful when blunt criticism of Mao was voiced.
    - `Since its inception in early 1956, the Hundred Flowers Campaign had hardly generated any echo outside the party. Although dissent in the PRC was rife, fear of potential repressions kept many mouths shut. Starting in mid-March 1957, the Chairman tried to reassure skeptics that the campaign would not lead to any repercussions. It was kicked off on May 1 with a public call to carry it out “as gently as a breeze or a mild rain.” In controlled meetings, those invited to speak tested the limits of the still unpublished Contradictions Speech. A significant number of people openly questioned the unchecked rule of the CCP, as well as the socialist system itself. Mao soon realized the magnitude of the menace he had provoked.` - [link](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafykbzaced4sn3i7kz7dz5ye7tlwvaj2zlb5xuiooyj47rxobfcxtahuci2vy?filename=%28Princeton%20Studies%20in%20International%20History%20and%20Politics%29%20Lorenz%20M.%20L%C3%BCthi%20-%20The%20Sino-Soviet%20Split_%20Cold%20War%20in%20the%20Communist%20World-Princeton%20University%20Press%20%282008%29.pdf)
- Consequent to the relative freedoms of the de-Stalinized USSR, Mao retained the Stalinist model of Marxist–Leninist economy, government, and society.
    - `Further disagreements arose over the Hundred Flowers Campaign and Stalin’s mistakes in the Chinese Revolution. Far more serious, though, were differences linked to Khrushchev’s pursuit of two essentially contradictory strategic goals: relaxation of relations with the West and a close partnership with anti-imperialist China.` - [link](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafykbzaced4sn3i7kz7dz5ye7tlwvaj2zlb5xuiooyj47rxobfcxtahuci2vy?filename=%28Princeton%20Studies%20in%20International%20History%20and%20Politics%29%20Lorenz%20M.%20L%C3%BCthi%20-%20The%20Sino-Soviet%20Split_%20Cold%20War%20in%20the%20Communist%20World-Princeton%20University%20Press%20%282008%29.pdf)

### 1957-59 Mao's Anti-Rightist Campaign

- The Anti-Rightist Campaign in the People's Republic of China, which lasted from 1957 to roughly 1959, was a political campaign to purge alleged "Rightists", meaning capitalists, within the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the country as a whole.
    
- Mao used the Hundred Flowers Campaign to expose dissenters within Chinese society.
    
    - `Mao soon realized the magnitude of the menace he had provoked. On May 15, he sent out an internal circular to high-ranking party cadres instructing them to allow criticism to continue. The Chairman wanted the “rightists” to expose themselves in full; he was not content in getting only the small fry because he wanted “to catch the big fish, [and] ... dig ... out the poisonous weed” once and for all. In early June, Mao decided that the party would “counterattack.” The Chairman boasted that he had set up a trap by breaking the whole campaign “into many small ‘Hungarian incidents’ ... [to be] dealt with individually.` - [link](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafykbzaced4sn3i7kz7dz5ye7tlwvaj2zlb5xuiooyj47rxobfcxtahuci2vy?filename=%28Princeton%20Studies%20in%20International%20History%20and%20Politics%29%20Lorenz%20M.%20L%C3%BCthi%20-%20The%20Sino-Soviet%20Split_%20Cold%20War%20in%20the%20Communist%20World-Princeton%20University%20Press%20%282008%29.pdf)
- Administering several provinces in the southwest, Deng Xiaoping proved so zealous in liquidating alleged counter-revolutionaries that even the Chairman felt obliged to write to him. Mao urged Deng Xiaoping to slow down the campaign's body count.
    
    - `The wave of public executions that engulfed Deng’s region was so large that the Chairman himself felt compelled to intervene. “We should not kill too many people,” he wrote to Deng on April 30, 1951. “If we kill too many, we will forfeit public sympathy and a shortage of labor power will arise.” He issued a new order: in the countryside execute no more than one in a thousand, and in the cities even less.` - [link](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafykbzaceajwfdkecnp6cq3rzod3brl32j2oc4elrbjjpelyxzlob3r5qudki?filename=Alexander%20V.%20Pantsov%2C%20Steven%20I.%20Levine%20-%20Deng%20Xiaoping_%20A%20Revolutionary%20Life-Oxford%20University%20Press%20%282015%29.pdf)
- In 1960, Khrushchev slammed Mao in public while addressing a congress of the Romanian communist party.
    
    - `The most vitriolic disagreement was perhaps the one that took place at the congress of the Romanian Communist Party in 1960 between Khrushchev, who denounced Mao as a “nationalist, adventurist, and deviationist”` - [link](http://jirfp.com/journals/jirfp/Vol_7_No_1_June_2019/4.pdf)
- The 1962 Sino-Indian war, instead of Moscow supporting its fellow communist nation in the month-long border clash it took the opportunity to strengthen its relationship with New Delhi offering arms and technology to be used against the Chinese. Beijing in extreme protest broke off its diplomatic relations with the soviet union making the split now official.
    
    - `On the Indian side political considerations were important. Relations with the Soviet Union had improved, and some visible form of military cooperation appeared likely to act as a restraint on China.` - [link](https://annas-archive.org/scidb/https://www.jstor.org/stable/2643691)

## 1991 Gorbachev’s General Secretary Resignation

- On August 24, 1991, Gorbachev resigned as the general secretary the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and dissolved all party units in the government. Five days later, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union indefinitely suspended all CPSU activity on Soviet territory
    - `The secretariat, the Politburo of the Central Committee of the CPSU did not oppose the coup. The Central Committee failed to take a resolute position of condemnation and opposition, did not rouse the communists to fight against the violation of constitutional legality. Among the conspirators were members of the party leadership, a number of party committees and the media supported the actions of state criminals. This put the communists in a false position. Many members of the party refused to cooperate with the conspirators, condemned the coup and joined the struggle against it. No one has the moral right to indiscriminately accuse all communists, and I, as the President, consider myself obliged to protect them as citizens from unfounded accusations. In this situation, the Central Committee of the CPSU must take a difficult but honest decision to dissolve itself. The fate of the republican communist parties and local party organizations will be determined by them themselves. I do not consider it possible for myself to continue to perform the functions of the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU and I am resigning the relevant powers. I believe that democratically minded communists, who have remained faithful to constitutional legality and the course of renewing society, will come out in favor of creating a party on a new basis that, together with all progressive forces, will be able to actively engage in the continuation of fundamental democratic changes in the interests of working people.` - Gorbachev [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20110927154108/http://www.illuminats.ru/component/content/article/29-new/1198-statement-by-mikhail-gorbachev-on-the-addition-of-duties-the-secretary-general-of-the-cpsu-24-august-1991?directory=29)

Here’s what Smith wrote via email: “My PhD which became my first book - Red Petrogard - derives from my wrestling with the libertarian critique of Bolshevism. In key respects, my research - and I genuinely had an open mind - showed that Brinton and Avrich fundamentally misunderstood the factory committees, which only very belatedly began to dabble with ideas of worker self-management (being overwhelmingly concerned with not letting workers bear the cost of the implosion of the war economy in 1917). More importantly I showed - as Goodey had suggested, but not really worked through - that the committees were seeking to centralise their activities with a view to being the directing centre of something like a planned economy, but one rooted in workers’ power. I also showed that Lenin - for a few months, until the scale of the collapse of the economy hit him - was broadly sympathetic to the concept of workers’ control. The far left uses Red Petrograd to show (correctly) how quickly the factory committee movement in Petrograd rallied around the Bolshevik cause. What they ignore is that the Bolshevik leaders showed scant interest in the factory committees until after October (...)”)

### Notes

- Bukharin identifies the next stage in economic development as “state capitalism”
- Lenin says state need a monopoly on capitalism to transition to socialism
- Many people claiming to be Marxist-Leninists don’t read the works of their idolized authors when they try to argue with leftcoms and anarchists denying the existence of state capitalism
- Many MLs don’t seem to know many of the bureaucrats never said their state was communist— only transitioning to communism
- On Soviet industrialisation and economy, R.W. Davies has done pioneering work (books are from 1980 to 2018!), especially with his series (partly with Stephen Wheatcroft)

## 1992 Russian Occupation of Transnistria, Moldova

- In 1992, between 2 March and 1 July 1992, Russia lead in creating a breakaway state away from Moldova.
- Russian forces were decisive in the conflict as the 2 primary parties military forces weren't at a effective capacity.
    - `Neither side had a proper military force. The intervention of the Russian Fourteenth Army and its commander General Alexander Lebed on behalf of the Transdniestrians was decisive.` - [link](https://carnegieendowment.org/files/deWaal_UncertainGround_final.pdf)
    - `This response was too much for the commander of the 14th Army General Yuri Netkachev, who ordered Russian troops to drive out the Moldovan forces. The 14th Army had always supported the separatists since the very beginning, but this direct support was the first open participation in combat.` - [link](https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&lr=&id=SYd7DwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA1&dq=De+La+Pedraja,+Ren%C3%A9+(2018).+The+Russian+Military+Resurgence++Post+Soviet+Decline+and+Rebuilding,+1992+2018.&ots=oCjsdjbcnk&sig=quDdQX_wZD8CI1OFip1g6dcZxpY&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=De%20La%20Pedraja%2C%20Ren%C3%A9%20(2018).%20The%20Russian%20Military%20Resurgence%20%20Post%20Soviet%20Decline%20and%20Rebuilding%2C%201992%202018.&f=false)

    - `Moldovan forces were concentrated in a forest near Bender, and Lebed decided to stop their advance by relying on his powerful artillery. At 0300 on 3 July massive barrages rained down on the unsuspecting Moldovans` - [link](https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&lr=&id=SYd7DwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA1&dq=De+La+Pedraja,+Ren%C3%A9+(2018).+The+Russian+Military+Resurgence++Post+Soviet+Decline+and+Rebuilding,+1992+2018.&ots=oCjsdjbcnk&sig=quDdQX_wZD8CI1OFip1g6dcZxpY&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=De%20La%20Pedraja%2C%20Ren%C3%A9%20(2018).%20The%20Russian%20Military%20Resurgence%20%20Post%20Soviet%20Decline%20and%20Rebuilding%2C%201992%202018.&f=false)

    - `President Yeltsin issued a critical decree on April 1, 1992 that transferred the 14th Army to Russian jurisdiction. At this point, it was almost inevitable that the 14th Army would become embroiled in the military conflict. Finding itself in the middle of an escalating crisis, the 14th Army could maintain neutrality only with great difficulty. Its legal status following international recognition of Moldova's independence became that of a foreign army illegally occupying the territory of a sovereign state. Kishinev insisted on the immediate withdrawal of the 14th Army from the territory of Moldova, as its presence interfered with Kishinev's plans to regain control over the trans-Dniester region. The situation was further complicated by popular agitation in the region, as local inhabitants persisted in lobbying the 14th Army for protection from the Moldovan authorities.` - [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20070804114400/http://www.rand.org/pubs/conf_proceedings/CF129/CF-129.chapter4.html)
- In retrospect, comparing this invasion to the [Russian Invasion of Georgia](https://www.notion.so/27b787c817dd4ec6b105f068c07e9c03?pvs=21) and the [Russian Occupation of Donetsk and Luhansk](https://www.notion.so/27b787c817dd4ec6b105f068c07e9c03?pvs=21), justifications because of NATO expansion is irrelevant as Moldova’s constitution commits it to “permanent neutrality” [link](https://carnegieendowment.org/files/deWaal_UncertainGround_final.pdf)

- Following the Bucharest summit, Russian hostility increased and Russia started to actively prepare for the invasion of Georgia.
    - `In hindsight, it was after the Bucharest summit that the preparations for a military confrontation began in earnest. President Mikheil Saakashvili had already warned that this would happen. “If we don’t get [the MAP],” he said, “that’s exactly when they [the Russians] are going to start all kinds of troubles.”` - [link](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/bafykbzaceajvtew6qcfg2fwxq7qywj42btcuwqtzmlebwksdjrshjzzcnctou?filename=Marcel%20H.%20Van%20Herpen%20-%20Putin%E2%80%99s%20Wars_%20The%20Rise%20of%20Russia%E2%80%99s%20New%20Imperialism-Rowman%20%26%20Littlefield%20Publishers%20%282014%29.pdf)
- Russia’s interest was expressed as protecting Russian citizens.
    - `At the outset of the Russian intervention in South Ossetia, Russian officials claimed that this dramatic step was essential not only to protect Russian citizens (as a result of Russia’s passportization” policy, more than 90 percent of South Ossetia residents were Russian citizens) in the enclave but also to halt an ongoing genocide of South Ossetians by Georgian forces` - [link](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RRA400/RRA444-3/RAND_RRA444-3.pdf)
- Georgia suffered the greatest losses from the war, even being subject to Ethnic Cleansing by South Ossetians authorities.

    - `There were much larger losses among civilians. Following the command of their leader Eduard Kokoity, South Ossetian authorities destroyed almost all Georgian villages in their territory during the campaign of ethnic cleansing. Over 100,000 civilians were forced to flee South Ossetia and Abkhazia. About 35,000 were left with nowhere to return to, as their homes were destroyed.`[link](https://www.ksk.edu.ee/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ENDC_Occasional_Papers_4_final.pdf)
- Russian military bases we then established in Abkhazia and South Ossetia
    - Sergey Lavrov `...said troops would remain for the foreseeable future, though he did not indicate how many soldiers would be based in the area. Russia would sign formal agreements with both regions on the extent of the military presence.` - [link](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/09/georgia.russia)

    - `[Crimea](<https://www.notion.so/World-Politics-c1fa701ec5944179acd3e616ac8fd13b?pvs=21>) is not a disputed territory. There has been no ethnic conflict there, unlike the conflict between South Ossetia and Georgia. Russia has long recognized the borders of modern-day [Ukraine](<https://www.notion.so/World-Politics-c1fa701ec5944179acd3e616ac8fd13b?pvs=21>).

## 2014 Russian Annexation of Crimea

- On 27 February 2014, Russia invaded and subsequently annexed the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine. This event took place as a result of the [2014 Yanukovych Impeachment](https://www.notion.so/27b787c817dd4ec6b105f068c07e9c03?pvs=21).

These are our Russian people there. We couldn’t abandon them and leave them in danger.” Mr Putin said that Moscow had been prepared to use any military means necessary to defend Crimea against “the nationalists” in Kiev and their “puppet masters”: the US government.` - [link](https://www.ft.com/content/41873ed2-cb60-11e4-8ad9-00144feab7de)

    - `Maxim, a pro-Russian activist who refused to give his last name, said he and other activists had camped out overnight outside the local parliament in Crimea’s regional capital, Simferopol, when heavily armed men wearing flak jackets, and holding rocket-propelled grenade launchers and sniper rifles took over the building. “Our activists were sitting there all night calmly, building the barricades,” he said. “At 5 o’clock unknown men turned up and went to the building. They got into the courtyard and put everyone on the ground.` - [link](https://www.latimes.com/world/worldnow/la-fg-wn-ukraine-crimea-20140227-story.html)
- On 16 March 2014, The Russian-controlled Supreme Council then held a controversial referendum on the status of Crimea, which resulted in a publicly perceived majority vote to declare state independence and be part of Ukraine, however the true numbers of the results and turnout were lower than the Supreme Council had reported.
    - `With over half the votes counted, 95.5 percent had chosen the option of annexation by Moscow, the head of the referendum commission, Mikhail Malyshev, said two hours after polls closed. Turnout was 83 percent, he added - a high figure given that many who opposed the move had said they would boycott the vote.` - [link](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-idUSBREA1Q1E820140316)
    - `the website of the President of Russia’s Council on Civil Society and Human Rights (shortened to President’s Human Rights Council) posted a report that was quickly taken down as if it were toxic radioactive waste. According to this purported report about the March referendum to annex Crimea, the turnout of Crimean voters was only 30 percent. And of these, only half voted for the referendum–meaning only 15 percent of Crimean citizens voted for annexation.` - [link](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paulroderickgregory/2014/05/05/putins-human-rights-council-accidentally-posts-real-crimean-election-results-only-15-voted-for-annexation/?sh=136b06eaf172)

    - `After Russian forces invaded Crimea in late February, the Ukrainian army began moving its units to Kherson Oblast, conducting military exercises in fields. “I think we have a 70 percent chance to avoid war,” said Oleg Roy, deputy commander on the motorized military troop residing in camp. “But there is a 30 percent doubt that diplomacy won’t work.” By March 26, Russian flags were hoisted on all of the Ukrainian military bases in Crimea, while about half of the Ukrainian soldiers there defected to the Russian army, according to a report by the Ukrainian general staff. But Roy doesn’t condemn the defectors. Rather, he is compassionate. “I believe they are trapped in a very difficult situation,” Roy said. “What can the people do who have families living in Crimea? What if, by staying in the Ukrainian army, the relatives would face repression?”` - [link](https://www.kyivpost.com/multimedia/photo/ukrainian-soldiers-on-border-with-crimea-pray-for-peace-prepare-for-war-340963)

## 2014-22 Russian Occupation of Donetsk and Luhansk, Ukraine

- [Russia helped maintain a low intensity conflict from protests](https://www.notion.so/27b787c817dd4ec6b105f068c07e9c03?pvs=21) in the Donbass region leading to Pro-Russian separatist self-proclaimed states forming in Eastern Ukraine.
- Protests were caused by the repealing of Russian of its official language status as a result of the [2014 Russian Annexation of Crimea](https://www.notion.so/27b787c817dd4ec6b105f068c07e9c03?pvs=21) and the [2013-14 Ukrainian Euromaidan Protests](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lHeYAvBKvDX5He9LYD9Za4kFg7vsdF6YQbuge4cKwLQ/edit#heading=h.kiy3903jbuyg) causing unrest.
    - `Protests in Eastern Ukraine against the new Ukrainian government began almost immediately after the Maidan protests prompted Yanukovych’s flight from power. As noted in Chapter Two, the Rada voted to repeal the official status of the Russian language on February 23, stoking fear and anger in the east, where most citizens spoke russian. This measure, coupled with Russia’s operation in Crimea, encouraged the mobilization of both leftist and right-wing organizations in Eastern Ukraine. Their leaders, previously existing on the margins of Ukrainian political life, proclaimed themselves as “people’s mayors” and “people’s governors.”` - [link](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR1400/RR1498/RAND_RR1498.pdf)
- The initial protests across southern and eastern Ukraine were largely native expressions of discontent with the new Ukrainian government but supported by Russian Citizens.
    - `The protesters portrayed their actions as spontaneous and self-initiated, driven by public anxiety about the future after the victory of the Maidan movement in the capital. The Ukrainian government dismissed the outbreak of protests as provocations organized by pro Russian agitators and intelligence operators. Russian intelligence may have played a role in fomenting discontent, but the public agitation and outcry appeared genuine and not disconnected from the country’s political divisions. Some Russian citizens were allegedly paid to cross the border and participate in these events (professional agitators), and some Russians likely came to help the cause of their own accord, but most protestors were local Ukrainians.` - [link](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR1400/RR1498/RAND_RR1498.pdf)
- Fears of Kremlin influence in support of a specific Russian Mayoral candidate for Sevastopol were strengthened after Russian military involvement in those regions.
    - `The opening events of political turmoil in Eastern Ukraine closely followed the popular appointment of a Russian citizen as mayor in Sevastopol, Crimea, on February 24.` - [link](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR1400/RR1498/RAND_RR1498.pdf)
- That then influence made protests become occupations of major administrative buildings with further support pledged from Russia.
    - `An initial surge of activity took place in early March with a series of large demonstrations by mostly unarmed pro-Russian protesters. On March 1, while the Crimean operation was already unfolding, protesters seized the regional administration buildings in Kharkiv and Donetsk. On March 9, protesters took over the regional administration building in Luhansk and demanded a referendum be held on annexing the Luhansk Oblast (region) to Russia. Russian military support for the installment of a new mayor in Sevastopol may have convinced these protesters that they could count on Moscow’s backing. Some suggest that the early protests were somewhat staged. One account described a protest as “street theater,” in which “both sides would show a mix of on-camera resolve, even as they clashed they would knowingly flash moments of politeness, mutual respect, and restraint—as if many of them were a common people caught in their divided rulers’ fight.”`[link](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR1400/RR1498/RAND_RR1498.pdf)
- The Security Service of Ukraine claimed key commanders of the rebel movement during the beginning of the conflict, including Igor Strelkov and Igor Bezler were Russian agents.
    - `With a walrus mustache, a fiery temper and a reputation for brutality, Igor Bezler is the most feared of all the rebel leaders in eastern Ukraine. Nicknamed Bes, or “the Demon”, he is regarded as something of a loose cannon, even by other rebels, who speak about him in hushed tones. If the Ukrainian security services, the SBU, are to be believed, the Demon and a group of his men were responsible for shooting down Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 over the region a fortnight ago.` - [link](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/29/-sp-ukraine-rebel-igor-bezler-interview-demon) [link](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/20/three-pro-russia-rebel-leaders-suspects-over-downed-mh17)
- In late March, Russia built up its military forces near the Ukrainian eastern border, reaching 30–40,000 troops by April. [link](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-usa-military-idUSBREA2R1U720140328) The deployment was likely used to threaten escalation and stymie Ukraine's response to unfolding events.
    - `By March 26, the annexation was essentially complete, and Russia began returning seized military hardware to Ukraine.` - [link](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR1400/RR1498/RAND_RR1498.pdf)
- International propositions have been agreed but then met with disregard by Russian and the self-proclaimed `Donbass` leaders. For example, The Minsk agreements were a series of international agreements which sought to end the war in the Donbas region of Ukraine.
    - The first, known as the Minsk Protocol [link](https://www.osce.org/files/f/documents/a/a/123258.pdf), was drafted in 2014 by the Trilateral Contact Group on Ukraine, consisting of Ukraine, Russia, and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) with mediation by the leaders of France and Germany in the so-called Normandy Format.
    - After extensive talks in Minsk, Belarus, the agreement was signed on 5 September 2014 [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-29299092) by representatives of the Trilateral Contact Group and, without recognition of their status, by the then-leaders of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) and Luhansk People's Republic (LPR).
    - In the two weeks after the Minsk Protocol was signed, there were frequent violations of the ceasefire by both parties to the conflict. Talks continued in Minsk, and a follow-up to the Minsk Protocol [link](http://www.osce.org/ru/home/123807?download=true) was agreed to on 19 September 2014. [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-29290246) This memorandum clarified the implementation of the original Protocol.
    - The agreement failed to stop fighting, and was thus followed with a revised and updated agreement, Minsk II, [link](http://www.osce.org/ru/cio/140221?download=true) [link](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ukraine/11408266/Minsk-agreement-on-Ukraine-crisis-text-in-full.html) which was signed on 12 February 2015. [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-31435812) and the UN adopted a resolution calling for Minsk II agreements. [link](https://www.un.org/press/en/2015/sc11785.doc.htm)
    - Kremlin officials have announced that they are "not a party to the Minsk agreements", and that the agreements were "devoted to two conflicting sides". [link](http://tass.ru/en/politics/865384) And in 2022, President Putin said that the Minsk agreements "no longer existed" [link](https://tass.com/world/1408591)
- This continues with further pressure from Russia in the [2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lHeYAvBKvDX5He9LYD9Za4kFg7vsdF6YQbuge4cKwLQ/edit#heading=h.ag7b4h5sw26l) and the [2022 Russian Annexation of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson & Zaporizhzhia Oblasts](https://www.notion.so/27b787c817dd4ec6b105f068c07e9c03?pvs=21).

### 2017- **International Court of** Justice Case

- [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine_v._Russian_Federation_(2019))

## 2014 Glazyev tapes

- In 2016 Ukraine's Prosecutor General published wiretaps of telephone calls between Sergey Glazyev, Former Minister of Foreign Economic Relations of Russia, and a number of people in Ukraine directly involved in organizing pro-Russian mass riots in Odessa, Kharkiv and other cities in 2014.
    - 01.03.2014 - Glazyev instructs unknown man on the organization of mass unrest and create a pretext for invading army of Russian Federation. Sergey Glazyev: `Hi, Anatoliy Petrovych, why is Zaporizhia silent, where are they? We know exactly that he had a thousand of people. Where they are? Where are Kazaki? I have an order to raise everybody, to raise people. People should gather in the square to demand turn to Russia for help against “banderovtsy”. Specially trained people should knock out “Banderovtsy” from the building council, and then they should arrange the meeting of the regional state administration, gather executive authorities. Collect regional executive committee and give him the executive power and subordinate police to this new executive. I have direct orders – to raise the people in Ukraine where we can. So we must take people to the streets, so do as in Kharkiv and as soon as possible. Because as you see the president has signed a decree, operation began, here has reported that the military are raised. What are they waiting for? We can not do everything with force, we use the power to support people, not more. And if there are no people, what support there might be? Listen well, tell him that it is a very serious talk about the fate of the country and therefore there the war is going…` - [link](https://uaposition.com/analysis-opinion/english-translation-audio-evidence-putins-adviser-glazyev-russian-politicians-involvement-war-ukraine/)
- In the call, Glazyev gives instructions on how to increase the impact of these riots and turn them into occupation of administration buildings as well as gives instructions on receiving funding. He also instructed Sergey Aksyonov on how the Crimean referendum should be formulated.
    - 27.02.2014 - Glazyev and Zatulin discuss organizing mass riots in Odesa and Kharkiv Regions. Konstantin Zatulin: `That’s the main story. I want to say about other regions – we have financed Kharkiv, financed Odesa. So have taken applications from other regions, but as for now I slowed all down, because yet has not solved financial issue, but in the end I will stay alone with these obligations. Now I have paid to Kazaki the money, that they were promised by 10 people, but no one gave anything, well, etc. In general, on the financial issue are starting to annoy.` Sergey Glazyev: `So you say, have paid? And who paid?` Konstantin Zatulin: `I paid, and who else?` Sergey Glazyev: `So, you paid.` Konstantin Zatulin: `Well, there are small sums of 2 thousands, 3 thousands, like these. I have 4 requests signed by Chalyi for 50 thousand.` Sergey Glazyev: `Then you have to make a cost estimate, I will give it to those, let them work on the estimate.` - [link](https://uaposition.com/analysis-opinion/english-translation-audio-evidence-putins-adviser-glazyev-russian-politicians-involvement-war-ukraine/)

## 2020 **Poisoning of Alexei Navalny**

- On 20 August 2020, Russian opposition figure and anti-corruption activist Alexei Navalny was poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent and was hospitalized in serious condition. During a flight from Tomsk to Moscow, he became violently ill and was taken to a hospital in Omsk after an emergency landing there, and put in a coma. He was evacuated to the Charité hospital in Berlin, Germany, two days later. The use of the nerve agent was confirmed by five Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) certified laboratories.

## 2022- Russian Invasion of Ukraine

### Pre-Invasion

- Before the invasion, Putin accused NATO of threatening Russia's security, demanding that Ukraine be permanently barred from joining the alliance. [link](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_111767.htm)
    
    - `The focus of the Kremlin’s ire is no longer exclusively on the Two Plus Four deal, but essentially on all accords negotiated since the fall of the Berlin Wall. "You promised us in the 1990s that (NATO) would not move an inch to the East," Putin said in late January. And he is using that history to justify his current demands for written guarantees that Ukraine will never be accepted into the Western alliance.` - [link](https://www.spiegel.de/international/world/nato-s-eastward-expansion-is-vladimir-putin-right-a-bf318d2c-7aeb-4b59-8d5f-1d8c94e1964d)
- This `promise` is in reference to a conversation on February 9 1990 between the then U.S. Secretary of State James Baker and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. This was actually in reference to a specific set of NATO troops not moving into the then German Democratic Republic.
    
    - `What the Germans, Americans, British and French did agree to in 1990 was that there would be no deployment of non-German NATO forces on the territory of the former GDR. I was a deputy director on the State Department’s Soviet desk at the time, and that was certainly the point of Secretary James Baker’s discussions with Gorbachev and his foreign minister, Eduard Shevardnadze. In 1990, few gave the possibility of a broader NATO enlargement to the east any serious thought.` - [link](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2014/11/06/did-nato-promise-not-to-enlarge-gorbachev-says-no/)
- Gorbachev has even made it clear that NATO expansion at that time wasn't being discussed between the US and the USSR.
    
    - `We now have a very authoritative voice from Moscow confirming this understanding. Russia behind the Headlines has published an interview with Gorbachev, who was Soviet president during the discussions and treaty negotiations concerning German reunification. The interviewer asked why Gorbachev did not “insist that the promises made to you [Gorbachev]—particularly U.S. Secretary of State James Baker’s promise that NATO would not expand into the East—be legally encoded?” Gorbachev replied: “The topic of ‘NATO expansion’ was not discussed at all, and it wasn’t brought up in those years. … Another issue we brought up was discussed: making sure that NATO’s military structures would not advance and that additional armed forces would not be deployed on the territory of the then-GDR after German reunification. Baker’s statement was made in that context… Everything that could have been and needed to be done to solidify that political obligation was done. And fulfilled.”` - [link](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2014/11/06/did-nato-promise-not-to-enlarge-gorbachev-says-no/)
- Russia issued demands to the US and NATO, including a legally binding promise that Ukraine would not join NATO, as well as a reduction in NATO troops and military hardware stationed in Eastern Europe.
    
    - `Moscow for the first time laid out in detail demands that it says are essential for lowering tensions in Europe and defusing a crisis over Ukraine, which Western countries have accused Russia of sizing up for a potential invasion after building up troops near the border. Russia has denied planning an invasion. The demands contain elements - such as an effective Russian veto on future NATO membership for Ukraine - that the West has already ruled out.` - [link](https://www.reuters.com/world/russia-unveils-security-guarantees-says-western-response-not-encouraging-2021-12-17/)
- On 17 May 2002, Putin was asked about NATO-Ukraine relations and was categorical in his claim that tit was their business, not Russia’s.
    
    - `Question: Is Russia going to join NATO? What major changes do you foresee in the relations between Ukraine and NATO? And how do you see the pattern of Ukraine-Russia-NATO relations in the future?
    
    Vladimir Putin: Russia does not intend to join NATO. Russia, as you know, is engaged in a very constructive dialogue with NATO to create a new Russia-NATO structure “at twenty”, in which all twenty countries will be represented as nations, each having one vote, and all the issues will be solved without prior consultations, without any prior decisions on a number of issues being taken first within the bloc. You know about these issues and practical consultations have already been completed. These issues are terrorism, humanitarian operations, the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and other issues.
    
    I am absolutely convinced that Ukraine will not shy away from the processes of expanding interaction with NATO and the Western allies as a whole. Ukraine has its own relations with NATO; there is the Ukraine-NATO Council. At the end of the day the decision is to be taken by NATO and Ukraine. It is a matter for those two partners.` - [link](http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/21598)
    
- Ukrainian Support Of NATO Membership. NATO membership has been popular since May 2014. [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine%E2%80%93NATO_relations#:~:text=Popular%20support%20in%20Ukraine%20for%20NATO%20membership%20since%202002)

    - `On March 31, U.S. European Command raised its awareness level to “potential imminent crisis” in response to estimates that over 100,000 Russian troops had been positioned along its border with Ukraine and within Crimea, in addition to its naval forces in the Sea of Azov. This deployment, representing the highest force mobilization since Russia’s annexation of Crimea and military incursion into Eastern Ukraine in 2014` - [link](https://www.csis.org/analysis/unpacking-russian-troop-buildup-along-ukraines-border)

### The Invasion

- On 21 February 2022, Putin recognised the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic, two self-proclaimed states controlled by pro-Russian separatists in Donbas from the [2014- Russian Occupation of Donetsk and Luhansk](https://www.notion.so/27b787c817dd4ec6b105f068c07e9c03?pvs=21).

- On 22 February 2022, the Russian Federation Council unanimously authorized use of military force, and Russian soldiers entered both territories.
    
    - `Russian legislators have given President Vladimir Putin permission to use armed forces abroad.
    
    The decision by the upper house of parliament takes immediate effect - and it could presage a broader attack on Ukraine.
    
    It comes as Russia said it was evacuating its diplomatic personnel from Ukraine because they had received threats.` - [link](https://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-crisis-putin-asks-legislators-for-permission-to-use-armed-forces-outside-russia-12548832)
    
- On 24 February 2022, Russia, with the aid of Belarus, began a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, in an escalation from the [2014- Russian Occupation of Donetsk and Luhansk](https://www.notion.so/27b787c817dd4ec6b105f068c07e9c03?pvs=21).
    
- On 24 February, about 05:00 EET (UTC+2), Putin announced a "special military operation", allegedly to demilitarize and "denazify" Ukraine. [link](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russias-putin-authorises-military-operations-donbass-domestic-media-2022-02-24/) There was also rhetoric used referring to the invasion as a peacekeeping mission.
    
    - `Russia launched a full-scale invasion against Ukraine on Feb. 24 — two days after Russian tanks rolled into eastern Ukraine on a “peace-keeping” mission.` - [link](https://www.factcheck.org/2022/02/russian-rhetoric-ahead-of-attack-against-ukraine-deny-deflect-mislead/)
- Belarus, a close ally of Russia, has supported the invasion, Russian forces were permitted to stage part of the invasion from Belarusian territory. [link](https://edition.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-news-02-23-22/h_d115a65e9b6348752422ad427fa83b95) Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko also stated that Belarusian troops could take part in the invasion if needed, [link](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/belarusian-troops-could-be-used-operation-against-ukraine-if-needed-lukashenko-2022-02-24/) and Belarusian territory was used to launch missiles into Ukraine. [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/world-europe-60542877?pinned_post_locator=urn:asset:4b1fae66-d68a-4ba0-9cb3-bf962c5a10d2) Ukrainian officials have claimed that Belarusian troops have entered Ukraine. [link](https://time.com/6152999/russia-ukraine-belarus-kharkiv/) Talking at a security council meeting in Minsk, the Belarusian leader repeated that the Russian armed forces conducted missile launches into Ukraine from Belarus to prevent what he claimed was Ukraine's intention to attack Belarus. [link](https://news.sky.com/video/ukraine-invasion-belarusian-president-talks-over-map-of-ukraine-12555168)
    
- In contrast to the [2014 Russian Annexation of Crimea](https://www.notion.so/27b787c817dd4ec6b105f068c07e9c03?pvs=21) and [2014- Russian Occupation of Donetsk and Luhansk](https://www.notion.so/27b787c817dd4ec6b105f068c07e9c03?pvs=21) speeds of invasion, this invasion was met with more resistance from both the Ukrainian army and Ukrainian civilians and consequently a longer invasion time for the Russian armies.**
    
    - `A possible explanation for Russia’s failure to do so is that President Vladimir Putin built his war strategy on an assumption that Ukrainian defenses would easily fold, allowing Russian forces to quickly capture Kyiv, the capital, and crush Ukrainian forces in the east and south without having to achieve air superiority.` - [link](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-vladimir-putin-europe-nato-2d6348ea2fd973fa0c01e24acdff2908)
- This Caused non-NATO Countries governments to go from not recommending joining before to reconsidering after the invasion.
    
    - Before: `A 2014 Action Plan, signed by the Defence Ministers of Finland and Sweden, established a number of concrete joint projects to pursue that further binds the future of their security together. Due to their high levels of interoperability and operational capabilities, no decision about NATO membership would be made without close consultations between the two countries. In the meantime, NATO respects Finland and Sweden’s independence and decision not to join the alliance and does not pressure either countries to make a decision regarding membership. Finally, Finland and Sweden have deep business, cultural, and historical ties. While the two have different motivations around NATO membership, they share deeply held beliefs about their place in the Western community. If an accession were to happen, and if history is any guide, Finland and Sweden would likely join NATO together.` - [link](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/sisters-not-twins-prospects-finland-and-swedens-nato-accession)
    - After: `Russian aggression in Ukraine has pushed the Finnish public closer than ever to NATO. Finnish political parties will gather on Tuesday to discuss Russia’s attack on Ukraine and Finland’s role in Europe’s new power balance. Finland’s potential NATO membership will also be on the table, Prime Minister Sanna Marin told reporters Monday.` `“It is very understandable that many Finns have changed or are changing their minds after Russia started waging war on Ukraine,” Marin said.` - [link](https://www.politico.eu/article/finland-nato-membership-sanna-marin-ukraine-russia/)

### 2022 Russian Annexation of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson & Zaporizhzhia Oblasts.

- On 27 September 2022, Russian-installed officials in Ukraine held staged referendums on the annexation of occupied territories of Ukraine by Russia. They were widely described as sham referendums by commentators and denounced by various countries.
    
    - UN Secretary-General condemns Russia annexation plan: `“In this moment of peril, I must underscore my duty as Secretary-General to uphold the Charter of the United Nations,” he told journalists in New York.
    
    “The Charter is clear. Any annexation of a State’s territory by another State resulting from the threat or use of force is a violation of the Principles of the UN Charter and international law.”` - [link](https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/09/1129047)
    
    - Biden at the UN General Assembly: `At the opening of a wide-ranging address to the UN General Assembly, President Biden said that amid countless upheavals the world had witnessed over the past year – from extreme weather events to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and rolling food and fuel shortages – “a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council invaded his neighbor ... attempted to erase a sovereign State from the map.”
    
    “Russia,” he continued, “has shamelessly violated the core tenets of the United Nations Charter ... and “just today [Russian President Vladimir] Putin has made overt nuclear threats against Europe in reckless disregard of the global non-proliferation regime.” Mr. Biden also said Russia was “right now” calling up more soldiers and preparing a “sham” referendum on the annexation of lands it already occupied in eastern Ukraine.` - [link](https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/09/1127321)
    
- Ukrainians have reported armed soldiers going door-to-door in occupied parts of the country to collect votes for self-styled "referendums" on joining Russia.
    
    - `"You have to answer verbally and the soldier marks the answer on the sheet and keeps it," one woman in Enerhodar told the BBC.
    
    In southern Kherson, Russian guardsmen stood with a ballot box in the middle of the city to collect people's votes.
    
    The door-to-door voting is for "security", Russian state media says.
    
    "In-person voting will take place exclusively on 27 September," Tass reported. "On the other days, voting will be organised in communities and in a door-to-door manner."
    
    One woman in Melitopol told the BBC that two local "collaborators" arrived with two Russian soldiers at her parents' flat, to give them a ballot to sign.
    
    "My dad put 'no' [to joining Russia]," the woman said. "My mum stood nearby, and asked what would happen for putting 'no'. They said, 'Nothing'.
    
    "Mum is now worried that the Russians will persecute them."
    
    The woman also said there was one ballot for the entire household, rather than per person.
    
    Although the evidence is anecdotal, the presence of armed men conducting the vote contradicts Moscow's insistence that this is a free or fair process.` - [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-63013356)
    
- On 30 September 2022, Russia's president Vladimir Putin announced the annexation of Ukraine's Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions in an address to both houses of the Russian parliament. Ukraine, the United States, the European Union and the United Nations all condemned the annexation.
    
    - `President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Citizens of Russia, citizens of the Donetsk and Lugansk people’s republics, residents of the Zaporozhye and Kherson regions, deputies of the State Duma, senators of the Russian Federation, As you know, referendums have been held in the Donetsk and Lugansk people’s republics and the Zaporozhye and Kherson regions. The ballots have been counted and the results have been announced. The people have made their unequivocal choice.
    
    Today we will sign treaties on the accession of the Donetsk People’s Republic, Lugansk People’s Republic, Zaporozhye Region and Kherson Region to the Russian Federation.` - [link](http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/copy/69465)
    
- Ahead of the proclamation, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated that an attack on the newly annexed territory would be considered an attack on Russia.
    
    - `Asked by reporters if an attack by Ukraine on the territories Russia is claiming as its land would be considered an attack on Russia, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: "It would not be anything else."
    
    Putin said last week he was willing to use nuclear weapons to defend Russia's "territorial integrity".` - [link](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/kremlin-says-any-attack-annexed-territory-will-be-an-attack-russia-2022-09-30/)
