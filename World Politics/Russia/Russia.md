Here’s what Smith wrote via email: “My PhD which became my first book - Red Petrogard - derives from my wrestling with the libertarian critique of Bolshevism. In key respects, my research - and I genuinely had an open mind - showed that Brinton and Avrich fundamentally misunderstood the factory committees, which only very belatedly began to dabble with ideas of worker self-management (being overwhelmingly concerned with not letting workers bear the cost of the implosion of the war economy in 1917). More importantly I showed - as Goodey had suggested, but not really worked through - that the committees were seeking to centralise their activities with a view to being the directing centre of something like a planned economy, but one rooted in workers’ power. I also showed that Lenin - for a few months, until the scale of the collapse of the economy hit him - was broadly sympathetic to the concept of workers’ control. The far left uses Red Petrograd to show (correctly) how quickly the factory committee movement in Petrograd rallied around the Bolshevik cause. What they ignore is that the Bolshevik leaders showed scant interest in the factory committees until after October (...)”)

### Notes

- Bukharin identifies the next stage in economic development as “state capitalism”
- Lenin says state need a monopoly on capitalism to transition to socialism
- Many people claiming to be Marxist-Leninists don’t read the works of their idolized authors when they try to argue with leftcoms and anarchists denying the existence of state capitalism
- Many MLs don’t seem to know many of the bureaucrats never said their state was communist— only transitioning to communism
- On Soviet industrialisation and economy, R.W. Davies has done pioneering work (books are from 1980 to 2018!), especially with his series (partly with Stephen Wheatcroft)

## 1992 Russian Occupation of Transnistria in Moldova
- In 1992, between 2 March and 1 July 1992, Russia lead in creating a breakaway state away from Moldova.
- Russian forces were decisive in the conflict as the 2 primary parties military forces weren't at a effective capacity.
    - `Neither side had a proper military force. The intervention of the Russian Fourteenth Army and its commander General Alexander Lebed on behalf of the Transdniestrians was decisive.` - [Uncertain Ground - Engaging With Europe’s De Facto States and Breakaway Territories, Thomas De Waal, 2018](https://carnegieendowment.org/files/deWaal_UncertainGround_final.pdf)
    - `Bender, primarily inhabited by russians, had joined the separatist movement, but the Moldovan police was still holding out at installations inside the city. the battle began on 19 June when the 14th russian army provided armored vehicles for the separatists to capture the last remaining Moldovan police station in Bender. In reaction to this loss, the Chisinau government, sensing that the decisive battle was about to take place, rushed large Moldovan reinforcements to the city, and soon they had recaptured most of Bender. this response was too much for the commander of the 14th army General Yuri netkachev, who ordered russian troops to drive out the Moldovan forces. the 14th army had always supported the separatists since the very beginning, but this direct support was the first open participation in combat. and in a reflection of the chaos in Moscow after the fall of the Soviet Union, the russian general took the decision on his own.` - The Russian Military Resurgence: Post-Soviet Decline and Rebuilding, 1992-2018, Rene De La Pedraja, 2018

    - `President Yeltsin issued a critical decree on April 1, 1992 that transferred the 14th Army to Russian jurisdiction. At this point, it was almost inevitable that the 14th Army would become embroiled in the military conflict. Finding itself in the middle of an escalating crisis, the 14th Army could maintain neutrality only with great difficulty. Its legal status following international recognition of Moldova's independence became that of a foreign army illegally occupying the territory of a sovereign state. Kishinev insisted on the immediate withdrawal of the 14th Army from the territory of Moldova, as its presence interfered with Kishinev's plans to regain control over the trans-Dniester region. The situation was further complicated by popular agitation in the region, as local inhabitants persisted in lobbying the 14th Army for protection from the Moldovan authorities.` - [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20070804114400/http://www.rand.org/pubs/conf_proceedings/CF129/CF-129.chapter4.html)

## 2008 Russian Occupation of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, Georgia
- In 8–12 August 2008, Russia backed the self-proclaimed republics of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and aided in the establishment militarily of these two breakaway states away from Georgia.
- This was in response to George W. Bush campaigned for offering a Membership Action Plan (MAP) to Georgia and Ukraine During a NATO summit in Bucharest in April 2008. [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20190305061544/https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/03/world/europe/03nato.html?pagewanted=all)
- Vladimir Putin was in Bucharest during the summit. At the conclusion of the summit on 4 April, Putin said that NATO's enlargement towards Russia would be look at negatively towards Russia.
    - `would be taken in Russia as a direct threat to the security of our country` - [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20080724150537/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article3681609.ece)
- Following the Bucharest summit, Russian hostility increased and Russia started to actively prepare for the invasion of Georgia.
    - `In hindsight, it was after the Bucharest summit that the preparations for a military confrontation began in earnest. President Mikheil Saakashvili had already warned that this would happen. “If we don’t get [the MAP],” he said, “that’s exactly when they [the Russians] are going to start all kinds of troubles.”` - [link](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/bafykbzaceajvtew6qcfg2fwxq7qywj42btcuwqtzmlebwksdjrshjzzcnctou?filename=Marcel%20H.%20Van%20Herpen%20-%20Putin%E2%80%99s%20Wars_%20The%20Rise%20of%20Russia%E2%80%99s%20New%20Imperialism-Rowman%20%26%20Littlefield%20Publishers%20%282014%29.pdf)
- Russia’s interest was expressed as protecting Russian citizens.
    - `At the outset of the Russian intervention in South Ossetia, Russian officials claimed that this dramatic step was essential not only to protect Russian citizens (as a result of Russia’s passportization” policy, more than 90 percent of South Ossetia residents were Russian citizens) in the enclave but also to halt an ongoing genocide of South Ossetians by Georgian forces` - [link](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RRA400/RRA444-3/RAND_RRA444-3.pdf)
- Georgia suffered the greatest losses from the war, even being subject to Ethnic Cleansing by South Ossetians authorities.
    - `According to Thbilisi’s official data, Georgia lost 170 troops, 14 policemen and 228 civilians in the August war. 1,964 uniformed personnel were wounded and 14 troops were missing in action` - [link](https://www.ksk.edu.ee/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ENDC_Occasional_Papers_4_final.pdf)
    - `There were much larger losses among civilians. Following the command of their leader Eduard Kokoity, South Ossetian authorities destroyed almost all Georgian villages in their territory during the campaign of ethnic cleansing. Over 100,000 civilians were forced to flee South Ossetia and Abkhazia. About 35,000 were left with nowhere to return to, as their homes were destroyed.`[link](https://www.ksk.edu.ee/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ENDC_Occasional_Papers_4_final.pdf)
- Russian military bases we then established in Abkhazia and South Ossetia
    - Sergey Lavrov `...said troops would remain for the foreseeable future, though he did not indicate how many soldiers would be based in the area.

These are our Russian people there. We couldn’t abandon them and leave them in danger.” Mr Putin said that Moscow had been prepared to use any military means necessary to defend Crimea against “the nationalists” in Kiev and their “puppet masters”: the US government.` - [link](https://www.ft.com/content/41873ed2-cb60-11e4-8ad9-00144feab7de)

- On 16 March 2014, The Russian-controlled Supreme Council then held a controversial referendum on the status of Crimea, which resulted in a publicly perceived majority vote to declare state independence and be part of Ukraine, however the true numbers of the results and turnout were lower than the Supreme Council had reported.
    - `With over half the votes counted, 95.5 percent had chosen the option of annexation by Moscow, the head of the referendum commission, Mikhail Malyshev, said two hours after polls closed.

    - `After Russian forces invaded Crimea in late February, the Ukrainian army began moving its units to Kherson Oblast, conducting military exercises in fields. “I think we have a 70 percent chance to avoid war,” said Oleg Roy, deputy commander on the motorized military troop residing in camp. “But there is a 30 percent doubt that diplomacy won’t work.” By March 26, Russian flags were hoisted on all of the Ukrainian military bases in Crimea, while about half of the Ukrainian soldiers there defected to the Russian army, according to a report by the Ukrainian general staff. But Roy doesn’t condemn the defectors. Rather, he is compassionate. “I believe they are trapped in a very difficult situation,” Roy said. “What can the people do who have families living in Crimea? What if, by staying in the Ukrainian army, the relatives would face repression?”` - [link](https://www.kyivpost.com/multimedia/photo/ukrainian-soldiers-on-border-with-crimea-pray-for-peace-prepare-for-war-340963)

## 2014-22 Russian Occupation of Donetsk and Luhansk, Ukraine

- [Russia helped maintain a low intensity conflict from protests](https://www.notion.so/27b787c817dd4ec6b105f068c07e9c03?pvs=21) in the Donbass region leading to Pro-Russian separatist self-proclaimed states forming in Eastern Ukraine.
- Protests were caused by the repealing of Russian of its official language status as a result of the [2014 Russian Annexation of Crimea](https://www.notion.so/27b787c817dd4ec6b105f068c07e9c03?pvs=21) and the [2013-14 Ukrainian Euromaidan Protests](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lHeYAvBKvDX5He9LYD9Za4kFg7vsdF6YQbuge4cKwLQ/edit#heading=h.kiy3903jbuyg) causing unrest.
    - `Protests in Eastern Ukraine against the new Ukrainian government began almost immediately after the Maidan protests prompted Yanukovych’s flight from power. As noted in Chapter Two, the Rada voted to repeal the official status of the Russian language on February 23, stoking fear and anger in the east, where most citizens spoke russian. This measure, coupled with Russia’s operation in Crimea, encouraged the mobilization of both leftist and right-wing organizations in Eastern Ukraine. Their leaders, previously existing on the margins of Ukrainian political life, proclaimed themselves as “people’s mayors” and “people’s governors.”` - [link](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR1400/RR1498/RAND_RR1498.pdf)
- The initial protests across southern and eastern Ukraine were largely native expressions of discontent with the new Ukrainian government but supported by Russian Citizens.
    - `The protesters portrayed their actions as spontaneous and self-initiated, driven by public anxiety about the future after the victory of the Maidan movement in the capital. The Ukrainian government dismissed the outbreak of protests as provocations organized by pro Russian agitators and intelligence operators. Russian intelligence may have played a role in fomenting discontent, but the public agitation and outcry appeared genuine and not disconnected from the country’s political divisions. Some Russian citizens were allegedly paid to cross the border and participate in these events (professional agitators), and some Russians likely came to help the cause of their own accord, but most protestors were local Ukrainians.` - [link](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR1400/RR1498/RAND_RR1498.pdf)
- Fears of Kremlin influence in support of a specific Russian Mayoral candidate for Sevastopol were strengthened after Russian military involvement in those regions.
    - `The opening events of political turmoil in Eastern Ukraine closely followed the popular appointment of a Russian citizen as mayor in Sevastopol, Crimea, on February 24.` - [link](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR1400/RR1498/RAND_RR1498.pdf)
- That then influence made protests become occupations of major administrative buildings with further support pledged from Russia.
    - `An initial surge of activity took place in early March with a series of large demonstrations by mostly unarmed pro-Russian protesters. On March 1, while the Crimean operation was already unfolding, protesters seized the regional administration buildings in Kharkiv and Donetsk. On March 9, protesters took over the regional administration building in Luhansk and demanded a referendum be held on annexing the Luhansk Oblast (region) to Russia. Russian military support for the installment of a new mayor in Sevastopol may have convinced these protesters that they could count on Moscow’s backing. Some suggest that the early protests were somewhat staged. One account described a protest as “street theater,” in which “both sides would show a mix of on-camera resolve, even as they clashed they would knowingly flash moments of politeness, mutual respect, and restraint—as if many of them were a common people caught in their divided rulers’ fight.”`[link](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR1400/RR1498/RAND_RR1498.pdf)
- The Security Service of Ukraine claimed key commanders of the rebel movement during the beginning of the conflict, including Igor Strelkov and Igor Bezler were Russian agents.
    - `With a walrus mustache, a fiery temper and a reputation for brutality, Igor Bezler is the most feared of all the rebel leaders in eastern Ukraine. Nicknamed Bes, or “the Demon”, he is regarded as something of a loose cannon, even by other rebels, who speak about him in hushed tones. If the Ukrainian security services, the SBU, are to be believed, the Demon and a group of his men were responsible for shooting down Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 over the region a fortnight ago.` - [link](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/29/-sp-ukraine-rebel-igor-bezler-interview-demon) [link](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/20/three-pro-russia-rebel-leaders-suspects-over-downed-mh17)
- In late March, Russia built up its military forces near the Ukrainian eastern border, reaching 30–40,000 troops by April. [link](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-usa-military-idUSBREA2R1U720140328) The deployment was likely used to threaten escalation and stymie Ukraine's response to unfolding events.
    - `By March 26, the annexation was essentially complete, and Russia began returning seized military hardware to Ukraine.` - [link](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR1400/RR1498/RAND_RR1498.pdf)
- International propositions have been agreed but then met with disregard by Russian and the self-proclaimed `Donbass` leaders. For example, The Minsk agreements were a series of international agreements which sought to end the war in the Donbas region of Ukraine.
    - The first, known as the Minsk Protocol [link](https://www.osce.org/files/f/documents/a/a/123258.pdf), was drafted in 2014 by the Trilateral Contact Group on Ukraine, consisting of Ukraine, Russia, and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) with mediation by the leaders of France and Germany in the so-called Normandy Format.
    - After extensive talks in Minsk, Belarus, the agreement was signed on 5 September 2014 [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-29299092) by representatives of the Trilateral Contact Group and, without recognition of their status, by the then-leaders of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) and Luhansk People's Republic (LPR).
    - In the two weeks after the Minsk Protocol was signed, there were frequent violations of the ceasefire by both parties to the conflict. Talks continued in Minsk, and a follow-up to the Minsk Protocol [link](http://www.osce.org/ru/home/123807?download=true) was agreed to on 19 September 2014. [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-29290246) This memorandum clarified the implementation of the original Protocol.
    - The agreement failed to stop fighting, and was thus followed with a revised and updated agreement, Minsk II, [link](http://www.osce.org/ru/cio/140221?download=true) [link](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ukraine/11408266/Minsk-agreement-on-Ukraine-crisis-text-in-full.html) which was signed on 12 February 2015. [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-31435812) and the UN adopted a resolution calling for Minsk II agreements. [link](https://www.un.org/press/en/2015/sc11785.doc.htm)
    - Kremlin officials have announced that they are "not a party to the Minsk agreements", and that the agreements were "devoted to two conflicting sides". [link](http://tass.ru/en/politics/865384) And in 2022, President Putin said that the Minsk agreements "no longer existed" [link](https://tass.com/world/1408591)
- This continues with further pressure from Russia in the [2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lHeYAvBKvDX5He9LYD9Za4kFg7vsdF6YQbuge4cKwLQ/edit#heading=h.ag7b4h5sw26l) and the [2022 Russian Annexation of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson & Zaporizhzhia Oblasts](https://www.notion.so/27b787c817dd4ec6b105f068c07e9c03?pvs=21).

### 2017- **International Court of** Justice Case

## 2014 Glazyev tapes

- In 2016 Ukraine's Prosecutor General published wiretaps of telephone calls between Sergey Glazyev, Former Minister of Foreign Economic Relations of Russia, and a number of people in Ukraine directly involved in organizing pro-Russian mass riots in Odessa, Kharkiv and other cities in 2014.
    - 01.03.2014 - Glazyev instructs unknown man on the organization of mass unrest and create a pretext for invading army of Russian Federation. Sergey Glazyev: `Hi, Anatoliy Petrovych, why is Zaporizhia silent, where are they? We know exactly that he had a thousand of people. Where they are? Where are Kazaki? I have an order to raise everybody, to raise people. People should gather in the square to demand turn to Russia for help against “banderovtsy”. Specially trained people should knock out “Banderovtsy” from the building council, and then they should arrange the meeting of the regional state administration, gather executive authorities. Collect regional executive committee and give him the executive power and subordinate police to this new executive. I have direct orders – to raise the people in Ukraine where we can. So we must take people to the streets, so do as in Kharkiv and as soon as possible. Because as you see the president has signed a decree, operation began, here has reported that the military are raised. What are they waiting for? We can not do everything with force, we use the power to support people, not more. And if there are no people, what support there might be? Listen well, tell him that it is a very serious talk about the fate of the country and therefore there the war is going…` - [link](https://uaposition.com/analysis-opinion/english-translation-audio-evidence-putins-adviser-glazyev-russian-politicians-involvement-war-ukraine/)
- In the call, Glazyev gives instructions on how to increase the impact of these riots and turn them into occupation of administration buildings as well as gives instructions on receiving funding. He also instructed Sergey Aksyonov on how the Crimean referendum should be formulated.
    - 27.02.2014 - Glazyev and Zatulin discuss organizing mass riots in Odesa and Kharkiv Regions. Konstantin Zatulin: `That’s the main story. I want to say about other regions – we have financed Kharkiv, financed Odesa. So have taken applications from other regions, but as for now I slowed all down, because yet has not solved financial issue, but in the end I will stay alone with these obligations. Now I have paid to Kazaki the money, that they were promised by 10 people, but no one gave anything, well, etc. In general, on the financial issue are starting to annoy.` Sergey Glazyev: `So you say, have paid? And who paid?` Konstantin Zatulin: `I paid, and who else?` Sergey Glazyev: `So, you paid.` Konstantin Zatulin: `Well, there are small sums of 2 thousands, 3 thousands, like these. I have 4 requests signed by Chalyi for 50 thousand.` Sergey Glazyev: `Then you have to make a cost estimate, I will give it to those, let them work on the estimate.` - [link](https://uaposition.com/analysis-opinion/english-translation-audio-evidence-putins-adviser-glazyev-russian-politicians-involvement-war-ukraine/)

## 2020 **Poisoning of Alexei Navalny**

- On 20 August 2020, Russian opposition figure and anti-corruption activist Alexei Navalny was poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent and was hospitalized in serious condition. During a flight from Tomsk to Moscow, he became violently ill and was taken to a hospital in Omsk after an emergency landing there, and put in a coma. He was evacuated to the Charité hospital in Berlin, Germany, two days later. The use of the nerve agent was confirmed by five Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) certified laboratories.

## 2022- Russian Invasion of Ukraine

### Pre-Invasion

- Before the invasion, Putin accused NATO of threatening Russia's security, demanding that Ukraine be permanently barred from joining the alliance. [link](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_111767.htm)
    
    - `The focus of the Kremlin’s ire is no longer exclusively on the Two Plus Four deal, but essentially on all accords negotiated since the fall of the Berlin Wall. "You promised us in the 1990s that (NATO) would not move an inch to the East," Putin said in late January. And he is using that history to justify his current demands for written guarantees that Ukraine will never be accepted into the Western alliance.` - [link](https://www.spiegel.de/international/world/nato-s-eastward-expansion-is-vladimir-putin-right-a-bf318d2c-7aeb-4b59-8d5f-1d8c94e1964d)
- This `promise` is in reference to a conversation on February 9 1990 between the then U.S. Secretary of State James Baker and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. This was actually in reference to a specific set of NATO troops not moving into the then German Democratic Republic.
    
    - `What the Germans, Americans, British and French did agree to in 1990 was that there would be no deployment of non-German NATO forces on the territory of the former GDR. I was a deputy director on the State Department’s Soviet desk at the time, and that was certainly the point of Secretary James Baker’s discussions with Gorbachev and his foreign minister, Eduard Shevardnadze. In 1990, few gave the possibility of a broader NATO enlargement to the east any serious thought.` - [link](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2014/11/06/did-nato-promise-not-to-enlarge-gorbachev-says-no/)
- Gorbachev has even made it clear that NATO expansion at that time wasn't being discussed between the US and the USSR.
    
    - `We now have a very authoritative voice from Moscow confirming this understanding. Russia behind the Headlines has published an interview with Gorbachev, who was Soviet president during the discussions and treaty negotiations concerning German reunification. The interviewer asked why Gorbachev did not “insist that the promises made to you [Gorbachev]—particularly U.S. Secretary of State James Baker’s promise that NATO would not expand into the East—be legally encoded?” Gorbachev replied: “The topic of ‘NATO expansion’ was not discussed at all, and it wasn’t brought up in those years. … Another issue we brought up was discussed: making sure that NATO’s military structures would not advance and that additional armed forces would not be deployed on the territory of the then-GDR after German reunification. Baker’s statement was made in that context… Everything that could have been and needed to be done to solidify that political obligation was done. And fulfilled.”` - [link](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2014/11/06/did-nato-promise-not-to-enlarge-gorbachev-says-no/)
- Russia issued demands to the US and NATO, including a legally binding promise that Ukraine would not join NATO, as well as a reduction in NATO troops and military hardware stationed in Eastern Europe.
    
    - `Moscow for the first time laid out in detail demands that it says are essential for lowering tensions in Europe and defusing a crisis over Ukraine, which Western countries have accused Russia of sizing up for a potential invasion after building up troops near the border. Russia has denied planning an invasion. The demands contain elements - such as an effective Russian veto on future NATO membership for Ukraine - that the West has already ruled out.` - [link](https://www.reuters.com/world/russia-unveils-security-guarantees-says-western-response-not-encouraging-2021-12-17/)
- On 17 May 2002, Putin was asked about NATO-Ukraine relations and was categorical in his claim that tit was their business, not Russia’s.
    
    - `Question: Is Russia going to join NATO? What major changes do you foresee in the relations between Ukraine and NATO? And how do you see the pattern of Ukraine-Russia-NATO relations in the future?
    
    Vladimir Putin: Russia does not intend to join NATO. Russia, as you know, is engaged in a very constructive dialogue with NATO to create a new Russia-NATO structure “at twenty”, in which all twenty countries will be represented as nations, each having one vote, and all the issues will be solved without prior consultations, without any prior decisions on a number of issues being taken first within the bloc. You know about these issues and practical consultations have already been completed. These issues are terrorism, humanitarian operations, the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and other issues.
    
    I am absolutely convinced that Ukraine will not shy away from the processes of expanding interaction with NATO and the Western allies as a whole. Ukraine has its own relations with NATO; there is the Ukraine-NATO Council. At the end of the day the decision is to be taken by NATO and Ukraine. It is a matter for those two partners.` - [link](http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/21598)

- On 24 February 2022, Russia, with the aid of Belarus, began a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, in an escalation from the [2014- Russian Occupation of Donetsk and Luhansk](https://www.notion.so/27b787c817dd4ec6b105f068c07e9c03?pvs=21).
    
- On 24 February, about 05:00 EET (UTC+2), Putin announced a "special military operation", allegedly to demilitarize and "denazify" Ukraine.

- Belarus, a close ally of Russia, has supported the invasion, Russian forces were permitted to stage part of the invasion from Belarusian territory.

- In contrast to the [2014 Russian Annexation of Crimea](https://www.notion.so/27b787c817dd4ec6b105f068c07e9c03?pvs=21) and [2014- Russian Occupation of Donetsk and Luhansk](https://www.notion.so/27b787c817dd4ec6b105f068c07e9c03?pvs=21) speeds of invasion, this invasion was met with more resistance from both the Ukrainian army and Ukrainian civilians and consequently a longer invasion time for the Russian armies.**
    
    - `A possible explanation for Russia’s failure to do so is that President Vladimir Putin built his war strategy on an assumption that Ukrainian defenses would easily fold, allowing Russian forces to quickly capture Kyiv, the capital, and crush Ukrainian forces in the east and south without having to achieve air superiority.` - [link](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-vladimir-putin-europe-nato-2d6348ea2fd973fa0c01e24acdff2908)
- This Caused non-NATO Countries governments to go from not recommending joining before to reconsidering after the invasion.
    
    - Before: `A 2014 Action Plan, signed by the Defence Ministers of Finland and Sweden, established a number of concrete joint projects to pursue that further binds the future of their security together. Due to their high levels of interoperability and operational capabilities, no decision about NATO membership would be made without close consultations between the two countries. In the meantime, NATO respects Finland and Sweden’s independence and decision not to join the alliance and does not pressure either countries to make a decision regarding membership. Finally, Finland and Sweden have deep business, cultural, and historical ties. While the two have different motivations around NATO membership, they share deeply held beliefs about their place in the Western community. If an accession were to happen, and if history is any guide, Finland and Sweden would likely join NATO together.` - [link](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/sisters-not-twins-prospects-finland-and-swedens-nato-accession)
    - After: `Russian aggression in Ukraine has pushed the Finnish public closer than ever to NATO. Finnish political parties will gather on Tuesday to discuss Russia’s attack on Ukraine and Finland’s role in Europe’s new power balance. Finland’s potential NATO membership will also be on the table, Prime Minister Sanna Marin told reporters Monday.` `“It is very understandable that many Finns have changed or are changing their minds after Russia started waging war on Ukraine,” Marin said.` - [link](https://www.politico.eu/article/finland-nato-membership-sanna-marin-ukraine-russia/)

### 2022 Russian Annexation of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson & Zaporizhzhia Oblasts.

- On 27 September 2022, Russian-installed officials in Ukraine held staged referendums on the annexation of occupied territories of Ukraine by Russia. They were widely described as sham referendums by commentators and denounced by various countries.
    
    - UN Secretary-General condemns Russia annexation plan: `“In this moment of peril, I must underscore my duty as Secretary-General to uphold the Charter of the United Nations,” he told journalists in New York.
    
    “The Charter is clear. Any annexation of a State’s territory by another State resulting from the threat or use of force is a violation of the Principles of the UN Charter and international law.”` - [link](https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/09/1129047)
    
    - Biden at the UN General Assembly: `At the opening of a wide-ranging address to the UN General Assembly, President Biden said that amid countless upheavals the world had witnessed over the past year – from extreme weather events to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and rolling food and fuel shortages – “a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council invaded his neighbor ... attempted to erase a sovereign State from the map.”
    
    “Russia,” he continued, “has shamelessly violated the core tenets of the United Nations Charter ... and “just today [Russian President Vladimir] Putin has made overt nuclear threats against Europe in reckless disregard of the global non-proliferation regime.” Mr. Biden also said Russia was “right now” calling up more soldiers and preparing a “sham” referendum on the annexation of lands it already occupied in eastern Ukraine.` - [link](https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/09/1127321)
    
- Ukrainians have reported armed soldiers going door-to-door in occupied parts of the country to collect votes for self-styled "referendums" on joining Russia.
    
    - `"You have to answer verbally and the soldier marks the answer on the sheet and keeps it," one woman in Enerhodar told the BBC.
    
    In southern Kherson, Russian guardsmen stood with a ballot box in the middle of the city to collect people's votes.
    
    The door-to-door voting is for "security", Russian state media says.
    
    "In-person voting will take place exclusively on 27 September," Tass reported. "On the other days, voting will be organised in communities and in a door-to-door manner."
    
    One woman in Melitopol told the BBC that two local "collaborators" arrived with two Russian soldiers at her parents' flat, to give them a ballot to sign.
    
    "My dad put 'no' [to joining Russia]," the woman said. "My mum stood nearby, and asked what would happen for putting 'no'. They said, 'Nothing'.
    
    "Mum is now worried that the Russians will persecute them."
    
    The woman also said there was one ballot for the entire household, rather than per person.
    
    Although the evidence is anecdotal, the presence of armed men conducting the vote contradicts Moscow's insistence that this is a free or fair process.` - [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-63013356)
    
- On 30 September 2022, Russia's president Vladimir Putin announced the annexation of Ukraine's Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions in an address to both houses of the Russian parliament. Ukraine, the United States, the European Union and the United Nations all condemned the annexation.
    
    - `President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Citizens of Russia, citizens of the Donetsk and Lugansk people’s republics, residents of the Zaporozhye and Kherson regions, deputies of the State Duma, senators of the Russian Federation, As you know, referendums have been held in the Donetsk and Lugansk people’s republics and the Zaporozhye and Kherson regions. The ballots have been counted and the results have been announced. The people have made their unequivocal choice.
    
    Today we will sign treaties on the accession of the Donetsk People’s Republic, Lugansk People’s Republic, Zaporozhye Region and Kherson Region to the Russian Federation.` - [link](http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/copy/69465)
    
- Ahead of the proclamation, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated that an attack on the newly annexed territory would be considered an attack on Russia.
    
    - `Asked by reporters if an attack by Ukraine on the territories Russia is claiming as its land would be considered an attack on Russia, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: "It would not be anything else."
    
    Putin said last week he was willing to use nuclear weapons to defend Russia's "territorial integrity".` - [link](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/kremlin-says-any-attack-annexed-territory-will-be-an-attack-russia-2022-09-30/)
