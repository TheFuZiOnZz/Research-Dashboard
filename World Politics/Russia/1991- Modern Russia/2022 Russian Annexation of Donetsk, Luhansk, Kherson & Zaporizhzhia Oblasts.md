# 2022 Russian Annexation of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson & Zaporizhzhia Oblasts
- On 27 September 2022, Russian-installed officials in Ukraine held staged referendums on the annexation of occupied territories of Ukraine by Russia. They were widely described as sham referendums by commentators and denounced by various countries. UN Secretary-General and Biden condemned the Russia annexation plan. 
	- `“In this moment of peril, I must underscore my duty as Secretary-General to uphold the Charter of the United Nations,” he told journalists in New York.`
	  
	  `“The Charter is clear. Any annexation of a State’s territory by another State resulting from the threat or use of force is a violation of the Principles of the UN Charter and international law.”` - [Ukraine: UN Secretary-General condemns Russia annexation plan, UN News, 2022](https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/09/1129047)
    - `At the opening of a wide-ranging address to the UN General Assembly, President Biden said that amid countless upheavals the world had witnessed over the past year – from extreme weather events to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and rolling food and fuel shortages – “a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council invaded his neighbor ... attempted to erase a sovereign State from the map.”`
      
      `“Russia,” he continued, “has shamelessly violated the core tenets of the United Nations Charter ... and “just today [Russian President Vladimir] Putin has made overt nuclear threats against Europe in reckless disregard of the global non-proliferation regime.” Mr. Biden also said Russia was “right now” calling up more soldiers and preparing a “sham” referendum on the annexation of lands it already occupied in eastern Ukraine.` - [Biden denounces Russia’s ‘shameless violation’ of UN Charter, urges world to stand with Ukraine, UN News, 2022](https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/09/1127321)
- Ukrainians have reported armed soldiers going door-to-door in occupied parts of the country to collect votes for self-styled "referendums" on joining Russia.
    - `"You have to answer verbally and the soldier marks the answer on the sheet and keeps it," one woman in Enerhodar told the BBC.`
      
      `In southern Kherson, Russian guardsmen stood with a ballot box in the middle of the city to collect people's votes.`
      
      `The door-to-door voting is for "security", Russian state media says.`
      
      `"In-person voting will take place exclusively on 27 September," Tass reported. "On the other days, voting will be organised in communities and in a door-to-door manner."`
      
      `One woman in Melitopol told the BBC that two local "collaborators" arrived with two Russian soldiers at her parents' flat, to give them a ballot to sign.`
      
      `"My dad put 'no' [to joining Russia]," the woman said. "My mum stood nearby, and asked what would happen for putting 'no'. They said, 'Nothing'.`
      
      `"Mum is now worried that the Russians will persecute them."`
      
      `The woman also said there was one ballot for the entire household, rather than per person.`
      
      `Although the evidence is anecdotal, the presence of armed men conducting the vote contradicts Moscow's insistence that this is a free or fair process.` - [Ukraine 'referendums': Soldiers go door-to-door for votes in polls, BBC News, 2022](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-63013356)
