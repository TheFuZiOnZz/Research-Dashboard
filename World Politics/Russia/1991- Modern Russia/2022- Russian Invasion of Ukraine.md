# Pre-Invasion
- Before the invasion, Putin accused NATO of threatening Russia's security, demanding that Ukraine be permanently barred from joining the alliance. [link](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_111767.htm)
    - `The focus of the Kremlin’s ire is no longer exclusively on the Two Plus Four deal, but essentially on all accords negotiated since the fall of the Berlin Wall. "You promised us in the 1990s that (NATO) would not move an inch to the East," Putin said in late January. And he is using that history to justify his current demands for written guarantees that Ukraine will never be accepted into the Western alliance.` - [link](https://www.spiegel.de/international/world/nato-s-eastward-expansion-is-vladimir-putin-right-a-bf318d2c-7aeb-4b59-8d5f-1d8c94e1964d)
- This `promise` is in reference to a conversation on February 9 1990 between the then U.S. Secretary of State James Baker and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. This was actually in reference to a specific set of NATO troops not moving into the then German Democratic Republic.
    - `What the Germans, Americans, British and French did agree to in 1990 was that there would be no deployment of non-German NATO forces on the territory of the former GDR. I was a deputy director on the State Department’s Soviet desk at the time, and that was certainly the point of Secretary James Baker’s discussions with Gorbachev and his foreign minister, Eduard Shevardnadze. In 1990, few gave the possibility of a broader NATO enlargement to the east any serious thought.` - [link](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2014/11/06/did-nato-promise-not-to-enlarge-gorbachev-says-no/)
- Gorbachev has even made it clear that NATO expansion at that time wasn't being discussed between the US and the USSR.
    - `We now have a very authoritative voice from Moscow confirming this understanding. Russia behind the Headlines has published an interview with Gorbachev, who was Soviet president during the discussions and treaty negotiations concerning German reunification. The interviewer asked why Gorbachev did not “insist that the promises made to you [Gorbachev]—particularly U.S. Secretary of State James Baker’s promise that NATO would not expand into the East—be legally encoded?” Gorbachev replied: “The topic of ‘NATO expansion’ was not discussed at all, and it wasn’t brought up in those years. … Another issue we brought up was discussed: making sure that NATO’s military structures would not advance and that additional armed forces would not be deployed on the territory of the then-GDR after German reunification. Baker’s statement was made in that context… Everything that could have been and needed to be done to solidify that political obligation was done. And fulfilled.”` - [link](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2014/11/06/did-nato-promise-not-to-enlarge-gorbachev-says-no/)
- Russia issued demands to the US and NATO, including a legally binding promise that Ukraine would not join NATO, as well as a reduction in NATO troops and military hardware stationed in Eastern Europe.
    - `Moscow for the first time laid out in detail demands that it says are essential for lowering tensions in Europe and defusing a crisis over Ukraine, which Western countries have accused Russia of sizing up for a potential invasion after building up troops near the border. Russia has denied planning an invasion. The demands contain elements - such as an effective Russian veto on future NATO membership for Ukraine - that the West has already ruled out.` - [link](https://www.reuters.com/world/russia-unveils-security-guarantees-says-western-response-not-encouraging-2021-12-17/)
- On 17 May 2002, Putin was asked about NATO-Ukraine relations and was categorical in his claim that tit was their business, not Russia’s.
    - `Question: Is Russia going to join NATO? What major changes do you foresee in the relations between Ukraine and NATO? And how do you see the pattern of Ukraine-Russia-NATO relations in the future?`
      
      `Vladimir Putin: Russia does not intend to join NATO. Russia, as you know, is engaged in a very constructive dialogue with NATO to create a new Russia-NATO structure “at twenty”, in which all twenty countries will be represented as nations, each having one vote, and all the issues will be solved without prior consultations, without any prior decisions on a number of issues being taken first within the bloc. You know about these issues and practical consultations have already been completed. These issues are terrorism, humanitarian operations, the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and other issues.`
      
      `I am absolutely convinced that Ukraine will not shy away from the processes of expanding interaction with NATO and the Western allies as a whole. Ukraine has its own relations with NATO; there is the Ukraine-NATO Council. At the end of the day the decision is to be taken by NATO and Ukraine. It is a matter for those two partners.` - [link](http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/21598)
- Ukrainian Support Of NATO Membership. NATO membership has been popular since May 2014. [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine%E2%80%93NATO_relations#:~:text=Popular%20support%20in%20Ukraine%20for%20NATO%20membership%20since%202002)
- Russian Forces were amassing along the Ukrainian border as early as March 2021.

    - `On March 31, U.S. European Command raised its awareness level to “potential imminent crisis” in response to estimates that over 100,000 Russian troops had been positioned along its border with Ukraine and within Crimea, in addition to its naval forces in the Sea of Azov. This deployment, representing the highest force mobilization since Russia’s annexation of Crimea and military incursion into Eastern Ukraine in 2014` - [link](https://www.csis.org/analysis/unpacking-russian-troop-buildup-along-ukraines-border)
# The Invasion
- On 21 February 2022, Putin recognised the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic, two self-proclaimed states controlled by pro-Russian separatists in Donbas from the [2014- Russian Occupation of Donetsk and Luhansk](https://www.notion.so/27b787c817dd4ec6b105f068c07e9c03?pvs=21).

- On 22 February 2022, the Russian Federation Council unanimously authorized use of military force, and Russian soldiers entered both territories.
    - `Russian legislators have given President Vladimir Putin permission to use armed forces abroad.`
      
      `The decision by the upper house of parliament takes immediate effect - and it could presage a broader attack on Ukraine.`
      
      `It comes as Russia said it was evacuating its diplomatic personnel from Ukraine because they had received threats.` - [link](https://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-crisis-putin-asks-legislators-for-permission-to-use-armed-forces-outside-russia-12548832)
- On 24 February 2022, Russia, with the aid of Belarus, began a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, in an escalation from the [2014- Russian Occupation of Donetsk and Luhansk](https://www.notion.so/27b787c817dd4ec6b105f068c07e9c03?pvs=21).
- On 24 February, about 05:00 EET (UTC+2), Putin announced a "special military operation", allegedly to demilitarize and "denazify" Ukraine. [link](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russias-putin-authorises-military-operations-donbass-domestic-media-2022-02-24/) There was also rhetoric used referring to the invasion as a peacekeeping mission.
    - `Russia launched a full-scale invasion against Ukraine on Feb. 24 — two days after Russian tanks rolled into eastern Ukraine on a “peace-keeping” mission.` - [link](https://www.factcheck.org/2022/02/russian-rhetoric-ahead-of-attack-against-ukraine-deny-deflect-mislead/)
- Belarus, a close ally of Russia, has supported the invasion, Russian forces were permitted to stage part of the invasion from Belarusian territory. [link](https://edition.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-news-02-23-22/h_d115a65e9b6348752422ad427fa83b95) 
- Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko also stated that Belarusian troops could take part in the invasion if needed, [link](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/belarusian-troops-could-be-used-operation-against-ukraine-if-needed-lukashenko-2022-02-24/) and Belarusian territory was used to launch missiles into Ukraine. [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/world-europe-60542877?pinned_post_locator=urn:asset:4b1fae66-d68a-4ba0-9cb3-bf962c5a10d2) 
- Ukrainian officials have claimed that Belarusian troops have entered Ukraine. [link](https://time.com/6152999/russia-ukraine-belarus-kharkiv/) 
- Talking at a security council meeting in Minsk, the Belarusian leader repeated that the Russian armed forces conducted missile launches into Ukraine from Belarus to prevent what he claimed was Ukraine's intention to attack Belarus. [link](https://news.sky.com/video/ukraine-invasion-belarusian-president-talks-over-map-of-ukraine-12555168)
- In contrast to the [2014 Russian Annexation of Crimea](https://www.notion.so/27b787c817dd4ec6b105f068c07e9c03?pvs=21) and [2014- Russian Occupation of Donetsk and Luhansk](https://www.notion.so/27b787c817dd4ec6b105f068c07e9c03?pvs=21) speeds of invasion, this invasion was met with more resistance from both the Ukrainian army and Ukrainian civilians and consequently a longer invasion time for the Russian armies.
    - `A possible explanation for Russia’s failure to do so is that President Vladimir Putin built his war strategy on an assumption that Ukrainian defenses would easily fold, allowing Russian forces to quickly capture Kyiv, the capital, and crush Ukrainian forces in the east and south without having to achieve air superiority.` - [link](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-vladimir-putin-europe-nato-2d6348ea2fd973fa0c01e24acdff2908)
- This Caused non-NATO Countries governments to go from not recommending joining before to reconsidering after the invasion.
    - Before: `A 2014 Action Plan, signed by the Defence Ministers of Finland and Sweden, established a number of concrete joint projects to pursue that further binds the future of their security together. Due to their high levels of interoperability and operational capabilities, no decision about NATO membership would be made without close consultations between the two countries. In the meantime, NATO respects Finland and Sweden’s independence and decision not to join the alliance and does not pressure either countries to make a decision regarding membership. Finally, Finland and Sweden have deep business, cultural, and historical ties. While the two have different motivations around NATO membership, they share deeply held beliefs about their place in the Western community. If an accession were to happen, and if history is any guide, Finland and Sweden would likely join NATO together.` - [link](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/sisters-not-twins-prospects-finland-and-swedens-nato-accession)
    - After: `Russian aggression in Ukraine has pushed the Finnish public closer than ever to NATO. Finnish political parties will gather on Tuesday to discuss Russia’s attack on Ukraine and Finland’s role in Europe’s new power balance. Finland’s potential NATO membership will also be on the table, Prime Minister Sanna Marin told reporters Monday.` `“It is very understandable that many Finns have changed or are changing their minds after Russia started waging war on Ukraine,” Marin said.` - [link](https://www.politico.eu/article/finland-nato-membership-sanna-marin-ukraine-russia/)
- On 26 February 2022, Rossiya leaked a premade victory post called `The advance of Russia and the new world` arguing that Putin has started a new era in Ukraine and called the fall of the Soviet Union an tragedy.
	- `A Russian news agency has published and then deleted an article prematurely praising Russia's success in invading Ukraine.`
	  
	  `It applauds Russian President Vladimir Putin for solving the Ukraine "problem", saying that "Ukraine has returned to Russia" through military action. It suggests the author anticipated a rapid victory and the piece was published prematurely.`
	  
	  `The article, published by the state-owned RIA-Novosti news agency on Saturday (26 February) and described by Christo Grozev of fact-checkers Bellingcat, external as "extremely shocking, even for Kremlin standards", was quickly deleted from its website.`
	  
	  `Other Twitter users called it Russia's "victory celebration".` - [Ukraine crisis: Russian news agency deletes victory editorial, BBC News, 2022](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-60562240)
	- `A new world is being born before our eyes. Russia's military operation in Ukraine has opened a new era - in three dimensions at once. And of course, in the fourth, domestic Russian one. Here a new period begins both in ideology and in the very model of our socio-economic system - but this is worth discussing separately a little later.`
	  
	  `Russia is restoring its unity - the tragedy of 1991, this terrible catastrophe of our history, its unnatural dislocation, has been overcome. Yes, at a great cost, yes, through the tragic events of a de facto civil war, because now brothers, divided by their belonging to the Russian and Ukrainian armies, are still shooting at each other - but Ukraine as anti-Russia will no longer exist. Russia is restoring its historical completeness, gathering the Russian world, the Russian people together - in all its totality of Great Russians, Belarusians and Little Russians. If we had refused this, had allowed the temporary division to become entrenched for centuries, then we would not only have betrayed the memory of our ancestors, but would also have been cursed by our descendants - for allowing the disintegration of the Russian land.`
	  
	  `Vladimir Putin has taken upon himself - without a drop of exaggeration - historical responsibility, deciding not to leave the solution of the Ukrainian question to future generations. After all, the need to solve it would always remain the main problem for Russia - for two key reasons. And the issue of national security, that is, the creation of an anti-Russia and an outpost for the West to put pressure on us from Ukraine, is only the second most important of them.` - [The advance of Russia and the new world, Rossiya, 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220226224717/https://ria.ru/20220226/rossiya-1775162336.html)
- On 3 April 2022, RIA News publishes the plan for Ukrainian genocide.
	- `The operation to denazify Ukraine, which began with the military phase, will follow the same logic of stages in peacetime as the military operation. At each of them, it will be necessary to achieve irreversible changes, which will become the results of the corresponding stage. In this case, the necessary initial steps of denazification can be defined as follows:`
	  
	  `liquidation of armed Nazi formations (which are understood to mean any armed formations of Ukraine, including the Armed Forces of Ukraine), as well as the military, information, and educational infrastructure that ensures their activity;`
	  
	  `the formation of organs of popular self-government and militia (defense and law enforcement) of liberated territories, protecting the population from the terror of underground Nazi groups;`
	  
	  `installation of the Russian information space;`
	  
	  `confiscation of educational materials and prohibition of educational programs at all levels that contain Nazi ideological principles;`
	  
	  `mass investigative actions to establish personal responsibility for war crimes, crimes against humanity, the dissemination of Nazi ideology and support for the Nazi regime;`
	  
	  `lustration, publication of the names of accomplices of the Nazi regime, their forced labor to restore the destroyed infrastructure as punishment for Nazi activities (from among those to whom the death penalty or imprisonment will not be applied);`
	  
	  `the adoption at the local level, under the supervision of Russia, of primary normative acts of denazification "from below", the prohibition of all types and forms of the revival of Nazi ideology;`
	  
	  `the establishment of memorials, commemorative signs, and monuments to the victims of Ukrainian Nazism, perpetuating the memory of the heroes of the fight against it;`
	  
	  `inclusion of a set of anti-fascist and denazification norms in the constitutions of the new people's republics;`
	  
	  `creation of permanent denazification bodies for a period of 25 years.`
	  
	  `Russia will have no allies in the denazification of Ukraine. Because this is a purely Russian affair. And also because it is not just the Bandera version of Nazi Ukraine that will be eradicated, but also and above all Western totalitarianism, the imposed programs of civilizational degradation and disintegration, the mechanisms of subordination to the superpower of the West and the USA.`
	  
	  `In order to implement the plan of denazification of Ukraine, Russia itself will have to finally part with pro-European and pro-Western illusions, to recognize itself as the last resort of protection and preservation of those values ​​of historical Europe (the Old World) that deserve it and which the West ultimately abandoned, having lost the fight for itself. This fight continued throughout the 20th century and was expressed in the world war and the Russian revolution, inextricably linked with each other.` - [What Russia Should Do with Ukraine, RIA News, 2022](https://ria.ru/20220403/ukraina-1781469605.html)
- On 28 September 2022, The New York Times released transcripts of Russian soldiers phone calls to family and loved ones, in which they discussed low moral for war, descriptions of deceased civilians, being misled into the frontlines of war instead of training, criticisms of Putin and the Russian Government around military strategy blunders and the medias description of the war.
