# Pre-Invasion
- Before the invasion, Putin accused NATO of threatening Russia's security, demanding that Ukraine be permanently barred from joining the alliance. [link](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_111767.htm)
    - `The focus of the Kremlin’s ire is no longer exclusively on the Two Plus Four deal, but essentially on all accords negotiated since the fall of the Berlin Wall. "You promised us in the 1990s that (NATO) would not move an inch to the East," Putin said in late January. And he is using that history to justify his current demands for written guarantees that Ukraine will never be accepted into the Western alliance.` - [link](https://www.spiegel.de/international/world/nato-s-eastward-expansion-is-vladimir-putin-right-a-bf318d2c-7aeb-4b59-8d5f-1d8c94e1964d)
- This `promise` is in reference to a conversation on February 9 1990 between the then U.S. Secretary of State James Baker and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. This was actually in reference to a specific set of NATO troops not moving into the then German Democratic Republic.
    - `What the Germans, Americans, British and French did agree to in 1990 was that there would be no deployment of non-German NATO forces on the territory of the former GDR. I was a deputy director on the State Department’s Soviet desk at the time, and that was certainly the point of Secretary James Baker’s discussions with Gorbachev and his foreign minister, Eduard Shevardnadze. In 1990, few gave the possibility of a broader NATO enlargement to the east any serious thought.` - [link](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2014/11/06/did-nato-promise-not-to-enlarge-gorbachev-says-no/)
- Gorbachev has even made it clear that NATO expansion at that time wasn't being discussed between the US and the USSR.
    - `We now have a very authoritative voice from Moscow confirming this understanding. Russia behind the Headlines has published an interview with Gorbachev, who was Soviet president during the discussions and treaty negotiations concerning German reunification. The interviewer asked why Gorbachev did not “insist that the promises made to you [Gorbachev]—particularly U.S. Secretary of State James Baker’s promise that NATO would not expand into the East—be legally encoded?” Gorbachev replied: “The topic of ‘NATO expansion’ was not discussed at all, and it wasn’t brought up in those years. … Another issue we brought up was discussed: making sure that NATO’s military structures would not advance and that additional armed forces would not be deployed on the territory of the then-GDR after German reunification. Baker’s statement was made in that context… Everything that could have been and needed to be done to solidify that political obligation was done. And fulfilled.”` - [link](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2014/11/06/did-nato-promise-not-to-enlarge-gorbachev-says-no/)
- Russia issued demands to the US and NATO, including a legally binding promise that Ukraine would not join NATO, as well as a reduction in NATO troops and military hardware stationed in Eastern Europe.
    - `Moscow for the first time laid out in detail demands that it says are essential for lowering tensions in Europe and defusing a crisis over Ukraine, which Western countries have accused Russia of sizing up for a potential invasion after building up troops near the border. Russia has denied planning an invasion. The demands contain elements - such as an effective Russian veto on future NATO membership for Ukraine - that the West has already ruled out.` - [link](https://www.reuters.com/world/russia-unveils-security-guarantees-says-western-response-not-encouraging-2021-12-17/)
- On 17 May 2002, Putin was asked about NATO-Ukraine relations and was categorical in his claim that tit was their business, not Russia’s.
    - `Question: Is Russia going to join NATO? What major changes do you foresee in the relations between Ukraine and NATO? And how do you see the pattern of Ukraine-Russia-NATO relations in the future?`
      
      `Vladimir Putin: Russia does not intend to join NATO. Russia, as you know, is engaged in a very constructive dialogue with NATO to create a new Russia-NATO structure “at twenty”, in which all twenty countries will be represented as nations, each having one vote, and all the issues will be solved without prior consultations, without any prior decisions on a number of issues being taken first within the bloc. You know about these issues and practical consultations have already been completed. These issues are terrorism, humanitarian operations, the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and other issues.`
      
      `I am absolutely convinced that Ukraine will not shy away from the processes of expanding interaction with NATO and the Western allies as a whole. Ukraine has its own relations with NATO; there is the Ukraine-NATO Council. At the end of the day the decision is to be taken by NATO and Ukraine. It is a matter for those two partners.` - [link](http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/21598)

    - `On March 31, U.S. European Command raised its awareness level to “potential imminent crisis” in response to estimates that over 100,000 Russian troops had been positioned along its border with Ukraine and within Crimea, in addition to its naval forces in the Sea of Azov. This deployment, representing the highest force mobilization since Russia’s annexation of Crimea and military incursion into Eastern Ukraine in 2014` - [link](https://www.csis.org/analysis/unpacking-russian-troop-buildup-along-ukraines-border)
# The Invasion
- On 21 February 2022, Putin recognised the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic, two self-proclaimed states controlled by pro-Russian separatists in Donbas from the [2014- Russian Occupation of Donetsk and Luhansk](https://www.notion.so/27b787c817dd4ec6b105f068c07e9c03?pvs=21). [link](https://www.npr.org/2022/02/22/1082345068/why-luhansk-and-donetsk-are-key-to-understanding-the-latest-escalation-in-ukrain?t=1646563793053)
- On 22 February 2022, the Russian Federation Council unanimously authorized use of military force, and Russian soldiers entered both territories.
    - `Russian legislators have given President Vladimir Putin permission to use armed forces abroad.`
      
      `The decision by the upper house of parliament takes immediate effect - and it could presage a broader attack on Ukraine.`
      
      `It comes as Russia said it was evacuating its diplomatic personnel from Ukraine because they had received threats.` - [link](https://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-crisis-putin-asks-legislators-for-permission-to-use-armed-forces-outside-russia-12548832)
- On 24 February 2022, Russia, with the aid of Belarus, began a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, in an escalation from the [2014- Russian Occupation of Donetsk and Luhansk](https://www.notion.so/27b787c817dd4ec6b105f068c07e9c03?pvs=21).
- On 24 February, about 05:00 EET (UTC+2), Putin announced a "special military operation", allegedly to demilitarize and "denazify" Ukraine. [link](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russias-putin-authorises-military-operations-donbass-domestic-media-2022-02-24/) There was also rhetoric used referring to the invasion as a peacekeeping mission.
    - `Russia launched a full-scale invasion against Ukraine on Feb. 24 — two days after Russian tanks rolled into eastern Ukraine on a “peace-keeping” mission.` - [link](https://www.factcheck.org/2022/02/russian-rhetoric-ahead-of-attack-against-ukraine-deny-deflect-mislead/)
- Belarus, a close ally of Russia, has supported the invasion, Russian forces were permitted to stage part of the invasion from Belarusian territory. [link](https://edition.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-news-02-23-22/h_d115a65e9b6348752422ad427fa83b95) 
- Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko also stated that Belarusian troops could take part in the invasion if needed, [link](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/belarusian-troops-could-be-used-operation-against-ukraine-if-needed-lukashenko-2022-02-24/) and Belarusian territory was used to launch missiles into Ukraine. [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/world-europe-60542877?pinned_post_locator=urn:asset:4b1fae66-d68a-4ba0-9cb3-bf962c5a10d2) 
- Ukrainian officials have claimed that Belarusian troops have entered Ukraine. [link](https://time.com/6152999/russia-ukraine-belarus-kharkiv/) 
- Talking at a security council meeting in Minsk, the Belarusian leader repeated that the Russian armed forces conducted missile launches into Ukraine from Belarus to prevent what he claimed was Ukraine's intention to attack Belarus. [link](https://news.sky.com/video/ukraine-invasion-belarusian-president-talks-over-map-of-ukraine-12555168)
- In contrast to the [2014 Russian Annexation of Crimea](https://www.notion.so/27b787c817dd4ec6b105f068c07e9c03?pvs=21) and [2014- Russian Occupation of Donetsk and Luhansk](https://www.notion.so/27b787c817dd4ec6b105f068c07e9c03?pvs=21) speeds of invasion, this invasion was met with more resistance from both the Ukrainian army and Ukrainian civilians and consequently a longer invasion time for the Russian armies.
    - `A possible explanation for Russia’s failure to do so is that President Vladimir Putin built his war strategy on an assumption that Ukrainian defenses would easily fold, allowing Russian forces to quickly capture Kyiv, the capital, and crush Ukrainian forces in the east and south without having to achieve air superiority.` - [link](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-vladimir-putin-europe-nato-2d6348ea2fd973fa0c01e24acdff2908)
- This Caused non-NATO Countries governments to go from not recommending joining before to reconsidering after the invasion.
    - Before: `A 2014 Action Plan, signed by the Defence Ministers of Finland and Sweden, established a number of concrete joint projects to pursue that further binds the future of their security together. Due to their high levels of interoperability and operational capabilities, no decision about NATO membership would be made without close consultations between the two countries. In the meantime, NATO respects Finland and Sweden’s independence and decision not to join the alliance and does not pressure either countries to make a decision regarding membership. Finally, Finland and Sweden have deep business, cultural, and historical ties. While the two have different motivations around NATO membership, they share deeply held beliefs about their place in the Western community. If an accession were to happen, and if history is any guide, Finland and Sweden would likely join NATO together.` - [link](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/sisters-not-twins-prospects-finland-and-swedens-nato-accession)
    - After: `Russian aggression in Ukraine has pushed the Finnish public closer than ever to NATO. Finnish political parties will gather on Tuesday to discuss Russia’s attack on Ukraine and Finland’s role in Europe’s new power balance. Finland’s potential NATO membership will also be on the table, Prime Minister Sanna Marin told reporters Monday.` `“It is very understandable that many Finns have changed or are changing their minds after Russia started waging war on Ukraine,” Marin said.` - [link](https://www.politico.eu/article/finland-nato-membership-sanna-marin-ukraine-russia/)

# 2022 Russian Annexation of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson & Zaporizhzhia Oblasts.
- On 27 September 2022, Russian-installed officials in Ukraine held staged referendums on the annexation of occupied territories of Ukraine by Russia. They were widely described as sham referendums by commentators and denounced by various countries. UN Secretary-General and Biden condemned the Russia annexation plan. 
	- `“In this moment of peril, I must underscore my duty as Secretary-General to uphold the Charter of the United Nations,” he told journalists in New York.`
	  
	  `“The Charter is clear. Any annexation of a State’s territory by another State resulting from the threat or use of force is a violation of the Principles of the UN Charter and international law.”` - [Ukraine: UN Secretary-General condemns Russia annexation plan, UN News, 2022](https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/09/1129047)
    - `At the opening of a wide-ranging address to the UN General Assembly, President Biden said that amid countless upheavals the world had witnessed over the past year – from extreme weather events to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and rolling food and fuel shortages – “a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council invaded his neighbor ... attempted to erase a sovereign State from the map.”`
      
      `“Russia,” he continued, “has shamelessly violated the core tenets of the United Nations Charter ... and “just today [Russian President Vladimir] Putin has made overt nuclear threats against Europe in reckless disregard of the global non-proliferation regime.” Mr. Biden also said Russia was “right now” calling up more soldiers and preparing a “sham” referendum on the annexation of lands it already occupied in eastern Ukraine.` - [Biden denounces Russia’s ‘shameless violation’ of UN Charter, urges world to stand with Ukraine, UN News, 2022](https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/09/1127321)
- Ukrainians have reported armed soldiers going door-to-door in occupied parts of the country to collect votes for self-styled "referendums" on joining Russia.
    - `"You have to answer verbally and the soldier marks the answer on the sheet and keeps it," one woman in Enerhodar told the BBC.`
      
      `In southern Kherson, Russian guardsmen stood with a ballot box in the middle of the city to collect people's votes.`
      
      `The door-to-door voting is for "security", Russian state media says.`
      
      `"In-person voting will take place exclusively on 27 September," Tass reported. "On the other days, voting will be organised in communities and in a door-to-door manner."`
      
      `One woman in Melitopol told the BBC that two local "collaborators" arrived with two Russian soldiers at her parents' flat, to give them a ballot to sign.`
      
      `"My dad put 'no' [to joining Russia]," the woman said. "My mum stood nearby, and asked what would happen for putting 'no'. They said, 'Nothing'.`
      
      `"Mum is now worried that the Russians will persecute them."`
      
      `The woman also said there was one ballot for the entire household, rather than per person.`
      
      `Although the evidence is anecdotal, the presence of armed men conducting the vote contradicts Moscow's insistence that this is a free or fair process.` - [Ukraine 'referendums': Soldiers go door-to-door for votes in polls, BBC News, 2022](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-63013356)
    
- On 30 September 2022, Russia's president Vladimir Putin announced the annexation of Ukraine's Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions in an address to both houses of the Russian parliament. Ukraine, the United States, the European Union and the United Nations all condemned the annexation.
    - `President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Citizens of Russia, citizens of the Donetsk and Lugansk people’s republics, residents of the Zaporozhye and Kherson regions, deputies of the State Duma, senators of the Russian Federation, As you know, referendums have been held in the Donetsk and Lugansk people’s republics and the Zaporozhye and Kherson regions. The ballots have been counted and the results have been announced. The people have made their unequivocal choice.`
      
      `Today we will sign treaties on the accession of the Donetsk People’s Republic, Lugansk People’s Republic, Zaporozhye Region and Kherson Region to the Russian Federation.` - [link](http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/copy/69465)
- Ahead of the proclamation, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated that an attack on the newly annexed territory would be considered an attack on Russia.
    
    - `Asked by reporters if an attack by Ukraine on the territories Russia is claiming as its land would be considered an attack on Russia, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: "It would not be anything else."`
      
      `Putin said last week he was willing to use nuclear weapons to defend Russia's "territorial integrity".` - [link](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/kremlin-says-any-attack-annexed-territory-will-be-an-attack-russia-2022-09-30/)
