# 1962-70 North Yemen Civil War
- [[link]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Yemen_Civil_War)
### Background
- Yemen
    - In 1955, Iraq-trained Colonel Ahmad Thalaya led a revolt against Imam Ahmad bin Yahya.
    - Ahmad bin Yahya defeated the besiegers, publicly decapitating Ahmad Thalaya and then executing Emir Saif el Islam Abdullah, the 48 year old Foreign Minister who was to become the new leader under Thalaya's demands.
    - In March of 1958, Ahmad bin Yahya's son, Muhammad al-Badr, went to Damascus to tell Nasser that Yemen would adhere to the United Arab Republic, as long as Ahmad could keep his throne and power.
    - In 1959, while Ahmad went to Rome for medical treatments, fights between tribal chieftains erupted. When Ahmad returned, he decapitated one of his subjects and amputated the left hand and right foot of 15 others.
    - Imam Ahmad died on September 18th, 1962, and was succeeded by his son, Muhammad al-Badr, who appointed Colonel Abdullah Sallal, a known socialist and Nasserist, as commander of the palace guard.
- Egypt
    - Nasser had desired regime change in Yemen since 1957, and acted in January of 1962 by supporting the Free Yemen Movement.
    - In a desire to continue his pursuit of Arab nationalism, especially after the dissolution of the UAR in 1961, Nasser supported a regime change in Yemen by supporting Colonel Abdullah Sallal.
    - Nasser's considerations for sending troops to Yemen may have included the following
        - impact of his support to the [Algerian War of Independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algerian_War_of_Independence) from 1954–62
        - Syria breaking up from Nasser's UAR in 1961
        - taking advantage of a breach in British and French relations, which had been strained by Nasser's support for the [FLN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Liberation_Front_(Algeria)) in [Algeria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria) and primarily for his efforts to undermine the [Central Treaty Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Treaty_Organization) (CENTO), which caused the downfall of the [Iraqi monarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Kings_of_Iraq) in 1958
        - confronting [imperialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperialism), which Nasser saw as Egypt's destiny
        - guaranteeing dominance of the [Red Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea) from the [Suez Canal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suez_Canal) to the [Bab-el-Mandeb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bab-el-Mandeb) strait
        - retribution against the [Saudi royal family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_royal_family), whom Nasser felt had undermined his union with Syria.
### History

            - Several young princes who wanted to get rid of al-Badr but not the imamate
        - On September 25th, 1962, Sallal gathered known leaders of the Yemeni nationalist movement and began enacting the coup.
    - Execution
        - By late morning of September 26th, all areas of Sana'a were secured and the revolutionaries had achieved victory over al-Badr and his guards.

    - Teams
    - West Germany, The United Kingdom, The United States, and Jordan all supported al-Badr, the Imam.
    - Egypt, Italy, Yugoslavia and the USSR supported Sallal.
    - The US, under John F. Kennedy, tried to resolve the dispute while communicating with Nasser (Egypt), Faisal (Saudi Arabia), Hussein (Jordan) and Salla (Yemen). Nasser agreed to pull out, only if Jordan and Saudi Arabia also stopped their aggression, but Jordan and Saudi Arabia did not trust Egyptian intentions for the peninsula.
    - Sallal proclaimed he would follow Yemen's international obligations, including respect for Britain's Aden Protectorate, and Nasser promised a gradual withdrawal of its 18,000 man force, as long as Saudi Arabian and Jordanian forces retire from border regions.
    - On December 19th, 1962, the US recognized the Yemen Arab Republic, with the UN following the next day.
    - Britain, Iran, Turkey and most of western Europe did not recognize the republic, while West Germany, Italy, Canada, Australia, the remaining Arab governments, Ethiopia and the entire communist bloc did.
- Operation Hard-surface
    - The UN attempted to launch a mission based on the US National Security Council, in which a 25 mile demilitarized strip along the Saudi/Yemen border.
    - Egypt didn't really want to withdraw its forces, and Saudi Arabia had already begun cutting back support for royalists due to the threat of a combined Syria/Iraq/Egypt.
    - On September 4th, 1964, the UN admitted failure and ended the mission.
- Egyptian offenses
    - Egypt attempted to win an air war to substitute lack of ground power.
    - Egypt also bought off and sent humanitarian aid to many tribal leaders in order to encourage them to be loyal to the new republican government.

    - Egypt had run up a foreign debt of nearly $3b.
    - Nasser conceded they were facing difficulties, and raised a variety of taxes on the public to afford the war effort.
    - Nasser also supported Egyptian sabotage bombings in Saudi Arabia.
    - On May Day of 1966, Nasser said the war was entering the "long-breath strategy," where he would draw down troops from 70k to 40k and simply focus on reinforcing tighter positions, withdrawing from exposed positions. He also insisted on attacks on Najran, Qizan and other "bases of aggression", claiming they were originally Yemeni towns stolen by the Saudis in the 1930's.
    - Nasser was warned by both the US and the USSR not to escalate the conflict into a hot war with Saudi Arabia.
    - Tunisia broke diplomatic relations with the republic, and Sallal's government seemed on the verge of collapse.
- Chemical warfare
    - From 1963-1967 multiple gas attacks occurred against North Yemen villages, with claims that the Egyptians were behind the gas attacks.
    - By the end of July, 1967, 1,500 fatalities and 1,500 injuries were estimated among royalist Yemen villages.

- Siege of Sana'a
    - The royalists sieged the newly created republican government headed by Qadi Abdul Rahman Iryani, Armed Noman and Mohamed Ali Uthman. The royalists suffered due to Saudi Arabia no longer shipping them arms nor financing them after the Khartoum agreement, however.

- [[link]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_Revolution)
- [[link]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_Crisis_(2011%E2%80%93present))
## 2004-12 The Houthi Movement
History
- The Houthis began as theologically moderate in Yemen
- Their first organization, the Believing Youth, was founded in 1992 in Saada Governorate by either Mohammed al-Houthi, or his brother, Hussein al-Houthi.
- By 1994-95, 15k-20k students had attended camps that included lectures by Mohammed Hussein Fadhlallah (a Lebanese Shia scholar) and Hassan Nasrallah (Secretary General of Hezbollah).
- In 2004, 800 BY supporters were arrested in Sanaa. Saleh invited Hussein al-Houthi to a meeting in Sana'a, but he declined and was killed on the 10th of September, 2004, by Saleh's forces after a failed insurgency.
- They participated in the 2011 Yemeni Revolution against Saleh's administration.
- By May 2012, Houthis were in control of three governorates and were erecting barricades north of Sana'a.
- By September 2014, Houthis were said to control part of Sana'a.
- On January 20th, 2015, Houthi rebels seized the presidential palace, then deposed the president and dissolved parliament on February 6th.
- On the 20th of March, al-Badr and al-Hashoosh mosques came under suicide attack by ISIS, killing 142 Houthi worshippers and wounding more than 351, the deadliest terrorist attack in Yemen history.
- Saleh and the Houthi alliance broke down in late 2017, with the Houthis killing him on the 4th of December of the same year.
- On January 17th, 2022, Houthi missile and drone attacks on UAE industrial targets killed 3 foreign workers. Saudi Arabia launched an airstrike on January 21st against a detention center in Yemen in response, killing at least 70.
  
Membership and ranks
- They have lots of people.
  
Ideology
- The Houthis have a wide variety of religious and political influences. They seem mainly to stand in opposition to the corruption of earlier governments, and will vary their alliances opportunistically.
- In 2015, _Newsweek_ reported that the Houthis are fighting for "for things that all Yemenis crave: government accountability, the end to corruption, regular utilities, fair fuel prices, job opportunities for ordinary Yemenis and the end of Western influence."
- The Houthis have rejected portrayals that they are trying to restore the old Zaydi imamate.
- Sometimes the Houthis ally with Sunnis, other times they oppress them. :o
- The Houthis have a very unique interpretation of Islam that puts them in conflict with the other sects of Islam, even other Shi'ites/Zaydi traditionalists.
- Houthis have fought with Salafis and later aligned with them depending on conditions. Originally they "crushed" the Salafi community/al-Qaeda presence in Saada Governate, but between 2014-2019 the Houthi leadership have signed multiple co-existence agreements with the Salafi community.
- The Houthis have their own women security force and a Girl Scouts wing. Others claim that Houthis harass women and restrict their freedoms of movement and expression.

- On 20 May 2024, U.S. Secretary of State, Antony Blinken responded to the pursuit of ICC arrest warrants.
    
    > `The United States fundamentally rejects the announcement today from the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) that he is applying for arrest warrants for senior Israeli officials, together with warrants for Hamas terrorists.  
    >   
    > We reject the Prosecutor’s equivalence of Israel with Hamas. It is shameful. Hamas is a brutal terrorist organization that carried out the worst massacre of Jews since the Holocaust and is still holding dozens of innocent people hostage, including Americans.  
    >   
    > Moreover, the United States has been clear since well before the current conflict that that ICC has no jurisdiction over this matter. The ICC was established by its state parties as a court of limited jurisdiction. Those limits are rooted in principles of complementarity, which do not appear to have been applied here amid the Prosecutor’s rush to seek these arrest warrants rather than allowing the Israeli legal system a full and timely opportunity to proceed. In other situations, the Prosecutor deferred to national investigations and worked with states to allow them time to investigate. The Prosecutor did not afford the same opportunity to Israel, which has ongoing investigations into allegations against its personnel.  
    >   
    > There are also deeply troubling process questions. Despite not being a member of the court, Israel was prepared to cooperate with the Prosecutor. In fact, the Prosecutor himself was scheduled to visit Israel as early as next week to discuss the investigation and hear from the Israeli Government. The Prosecutor’s staff was supposed to land in Israel today to coordinate the visit. Israel was informed that they did not board their flight around the same time that the Prosecutor went on cable television to announce the charges. These and other circumstances call into question the legitimacy and credibility of this investigation.  
    >   
    > Fundamentally, this decision does nothing to help, and could jeopardize, ongoing efforts to reach a ceasefire agreement that would get hostages out and surge humanitarian assistance in, which are the goals the United States continues to pursue relentlessly.`
