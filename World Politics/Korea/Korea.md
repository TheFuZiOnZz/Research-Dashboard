## 2018 Denuclearisation Attempts
- Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un signed a Joint Statement which reaffirmed the Panmunjom Declaration. A result of that agreement, Kim Jong-un agreed to speed up the denuclearization process on the Korean Peninsula by building a new relationship between the United States and North Korea, signing a Joint Statement on June 12, 2018.
- Reuters revealed that on the second day of the North Korea–United States Summit in Hanoi, U.S. president passed DPRK Kim a note that bluntly called for North Korea to surrender all its nuclear weapons and fuel, a proposal the North Koreans had repeatedly rejected. [[withapieceofpapertrumpcal]]
- According to Jenny Town, Washington based, think-tank and North Korean expert, `it's Bolton's proposal in 2004, has been rejected more than once and, to bring it up again… would rather be insulting.` She also said that the US should have learned that this wasn't effective diplomacy, and shows they haven't learned how to properly negotiate.

- On September 10, Trump sacked the national security adviser John Bolton as he strongly disagreed with John Bolton's suggestion, [link](https://www.news.com.au/finance/work/leaders/sacked-national-security-adviser-john-boltons-legacy-of-turmoil/news-story/7d35044f50c60f1cbefd4e9282f44044) However, Bolton himself claims he was not sacked but resigned.

- China’s ambassador to the U.N. announced that the current standoff was a failure to counter `positive steps` taken by North Korea toward denuclearisation. A close U.S. ally, South Korea has also supported the official proposal of easing some sanctions to DPRK, and requested for diplomatic efforts to be focused on resuming nuclear talks.

- In 2020, Trump tells his advisers he doesn't want another summit with North Korea's leader Kim before the U.S. presidential election this year. It's understood that Trump might be focused on his re-election campaign; his desire to engage on the nuclear issue has waned. Although Trump’s disinterest, the top foreign policy advisers are still trying to build a bridge of the nuclear deal between two leaders. [link](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-51074956)
