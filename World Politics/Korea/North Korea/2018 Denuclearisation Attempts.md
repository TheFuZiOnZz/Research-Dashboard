## 2018 Denuclearisation Attempts
- Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un signed a Joint Statement which reaffirmed the Panmunjom Declaration.

- According to Jenny Town, Washington based, think-tank and North Korean expert, `it's Bolton's proposal in 2004, has been rejected more than once and, to bring it up again… would rather be insulting.` She also said that the US should have learned that this wasn't effective diplomacy, and shows they haven't learned how to properly negotiate.

- China’s ambassador to the U.N. announced that the current standoff was a failure to counter `positive steps` taken by North Korea toward denuclearisation. A close U.S. ally, South Korea has also supported the official proposal of easing some sanctions to DPRK, and requested for diplomatic efforts to be focused on resuming nuclear talks.

- In 2020, Trump tells his advisers he doesn't want another summit with North Korea's leader Kim before the U.S. presidential election this year. It's understood that Trump might be focused on his re-election campaign; his desire to engage on the nuclear issue has waned. Although Trump’s disinterest, the top foreign policy advisers are still trying to build a bridge of the nuclear deal between two leaders. [link](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-51074956)
