## 1930-33 Asharshylyk Famine
- In 1931 to 1933, the then, Kazakh SSR, and now Republic of Kazakhstan, experienced a famine.

- While these famines hit the Volga, the Don, the Urals, Russia, the Cascus and [[World Politics]] hard, Soviet bureaucrats completely upended the Kazakh traditional ways of life.
    - `This peculiar frontier society, which was struggling to emerge from the upheavals of 1916-1922, was struck by a second crisis in 1928. The events were characterized not only by the grain requisition crisis but also by a more generalized assault on the Kazakh way of life. This was a campaign to eliminate traditional authority, with the intent to incorporate the Kazakhs into the state governed from Moscow.` [link](https://sci-hub.st/10.2307/41036834)
- Kazakhs lost a greater percentage of their population due to famine than any other ethnic groups.
    - `the number of Kazakh deaths directly attributable to the famine of 1931-1933 was 1,450,000, or approximately 38 percent of the total population, the highest percentage of any nationality in the USSR.` [link](https://sci-hub.st/10.2307/41036834)
- Many of the techniques used during the Ukrainian famines and the Great Terror in the Soviet Union were first experimented in Kazakhstan and Central Asia
    - `Thus, one wonders whether the difference between the traumatic change brought about by collectivization and famine in Kazakh pastoral society and the eradication of the peasant culture in Soviet Ukraine was as big as Cameron contends. She writes that ``in many respects the Kazakh famine was more destructive than the Ukrainian famine, as the Kazakh famine brought about a cultural transformation, the loss of Kazakhs’ nomadic way of life, which was even more far-reaching than that endured by the Ukrainians.`` In her comparison with the situation in Ukraine, Cameron convincingly underscores that to some extent the Kremlin applied the same methods against starving Kazakhs as against starving Ukrainians: the expulsions from cities and towns,` [link](https://sci-hub.st/10.1080/14623528.2020.1807140)
- Famines in the east differ from the west in that, collectivization was war against the peasants, but in the east, forcing nomadic peoples to become sedentary
    - `The result would be threefold: there would be more draft animals for farm work; there would be a decrease in the number of animals the Kazaks owned, a source of continual conflicts with the peasants over pasture rights, herds ruining the peasants’ fields, etc.; the Kazaks would be forced to abandon nomadic animal herding, an economic form that was not highly productive for the state. The impoverished Kazaks would want to be “sedentarized,” they would till previously uncultivated land, or could be sent to work in mines and on industrial construction sites, or as was more likely, they would simply flee the district and become refugees and the problem they represented for the official who headed the district would be resolved.` [link](https://journals.openedition.org/monderusse/8681)
- Agrarian socialists who advocated for preserving Kazakhs' communalism were purged by Stalin
    - `The OGPU did not just deport 'enemies' or send them to camps, it also shot them. According to OGPU data, approximately 20,000 people were shot by the OGPU in 1930 and about 11,000 in 1931.` [link](https://sci-hub.st/10.2307/30043925)
- Moscow criminalizes transnational migrations which forced people to settle in drought-prone area. Russian settler-colonialism forced Kazakhs to change their migration routes and increased dependency on trading for grains
    - `They also quote a writer who referred to the famine in Ukraine as 'genocide', although they prefer to use the term to apply also to Kazakhstan and Russia. Their article stresses Stalin's use of harsh measures (e.g. forbidding migration from the most affected regions) and repression (arrest, deportation) against the peasantry.` [link](https://sci-hub.st/10.2307/30043925)
- Many Kazakhs sold their livestock to fulfill grain procurement, especially when the state demanded them to meet the quotas in the form of grains. Often the only place to get grains is by trading with European settlers
    - `During the NEP, after the disruptions of the 1916-1922 period, the economic relations between herdsmen and peasants were significant: the European peasants sold grain to the Kazaks, who bartered for or bought the grain by selling animals and products from animal rearing to the same European peasants, both at fairs and in the cities` [link](https://journals.openedition.org/monderusse/8681)
- To force grain production, Soviet Union made slaughters of livestock in the winter illegal and forced meat animals to become draft livestock
    - `According to the Stalinists, the peasants, who underfulfilled their procurement quotas and required the state to devote great efforts to procurement activities, were thereby guilty of major crimes: 'sabotage' and 'waging war against Soviet power'` [link](https://sci-hub.st/10.2307/30043925)
- Moscow’s obsession with grain procurements led to a 90% decline in herds
    - `The number of head of livestock in Kazakstan had therefore fallen by approximately 90% between 1928 and 1934, but for the areas inhabited by nomads and semi-nomads the figure was 97.5%.` [link](https://journals.openedition.org/monderusse/8681)
- Attempts to centralize livestock production led to epidemic outbreaks, killing many of the animals
    - `In Kazakhstan, thirty-one districts out of slightly less than 200 were eventually blacklisted. It is unclear, however, how many of these Kazakhstan districts were agricultural districts inhabited by Russian or Ukrainian grain-growers. These measures were implemented shortly after Moscow had acknowledged the almost complete disappearance of Kazakh livestock, exempted the Kazakhs from meat procurements for two years, and de facto privatized all the livestock that remained in Kazakhs’ hands.` [link](https://sci-hub.st/10.1080/14623528.2020.1807140)
- Kazakhs depended on animals for everything from transportation to subsistence to clothing to housing.
    - `In the Soviet Union in the late 1920s the principal peoples whose subsistence depended on transhumant-nomadic animal herding were the Kazaks, Turkmen, Kirghizes and Buriat Mongols` [link](https://journals.openedition.org/monderusse/8681)
- Stalin's vision of nationalism and ethnic tensions caused other republics to turn away Kazakh refugees.
    - `In July 1929 the committee of the Alma-Ata okrug approved a resolution which proclaimed the importance of agricultural colonization for bringing “free” farmland into cultivation. The governorship’s committee warned about an increase in ethnic tensions, expected to be a consequence of the changes in immigration policy.` [link](https://journals.openedition.org/monderusse/8681)
- USSR forcibly settled millions of European peasants to 'special villages' to colonize, complimenting the colonial GULAG system. Many of the Kazakhs were forcibly displaced to make room for labour camps and deported peasants from Europe. These resettled peasants fared better during the famine than the nomads.
    - `The last point is an important one, and it raises some of the key methodological differences between researching the Kazakh famine and some of the other crimes of the Stalinist regime, such as the Gulag system, the special settler system, or even the Ukrainian famine. In the Kazakh famine, a far greater percentage of those who suffered were illiterate, and some of the sources that historians typically rely on to get at the ground-level perspective, such as petitions, are much more difficult to find. In the case of the Ukrainian famine, there were numerous efforts to collect oral history accounts of the disaster, spurred in part by the congressional investigation into the Ukrainian famine in the 1980s.` [link](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/bafykbzacecxjoyfwngsqcbqltz4njzrhzwbeufwu2q3kvj2gnbgw7k363c3na?filename=Sarah%20I%20Cameron%20-%20The%20Hungry%20Steppe_%20Famine%2C%20Violence%2C%20and%20the%20Making%20of%20Soviet%20Kazakhstan-Cornell%20University%20Press%20%282018%29.pdf)
- Famine reconfigured kinship and clan relations from one of mutual aid and interdependence to a capitalist relation
    - `Furthermore the famine can and should be a progressive factor not only economically. It will force the peasant to reflect on the bases of the capitalist system, demolish faith in the tsar and tsarism, and consequently in due course make the victory of the revolution easier` [link](https://sci-hub.st/10.2307/30043925)
