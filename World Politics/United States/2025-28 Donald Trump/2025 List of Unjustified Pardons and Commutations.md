# Pardoning of 2 DC Police Officers
## Background
- Trump granted clemency to two DC police officers who had been convicted for unlawfully pursuing a black scooter rider, killing him, then trying to cover up the crime. Of course, Trump has pardon power, so this one probably wasn't illegal, per se, but it was still gross and negated a legitimate jury finding.
