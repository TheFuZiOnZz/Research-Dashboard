- It is a repurposing of the United States Digital Service
    - Quoting from the [Obama White House Archives](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2014/08/11/fact-sheet-improving-and-simplifying-digital-services), USDS's service had "one core mission: to improve and simplify the digital experience that people and businesses have with their government."
        - A Biden Administration [example press sheet](https://www.usds.gov/assets/files/USDS-Overview.pdf) for the types of things USDS would take credit for.
    - The USDS was established in 2014 after members in government worked with the Obama administration to clean up and assist with the rollout of healthcare.gov.
- Trump's [January 20th, 2025 Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/establishing-and-implementing-the-presidents-department-of-government-efficiency/) establishes DOGE (repurposed from the USDS) in the Executive Office of the President.
    - In subsection (c), Agency Heads are required to establish within their respective Agencies a team of at least four DOGE employees. It's unclear whether this process has been followed yet. It's unclear if this process is legal.
    - In Section 4., subsection (b), DOGE is limited to working within the maximum extent consistent with law, and is only given full and prompt access to all unclassified agency records.
- DOGE is supposed to terminate on July 4th, 2026.
- The head administrator of DOGE is Elon Musk.

The primary purpose of the USDS under Obama seems to have been to streamline the technological side of things in government departments. It was not created to further any sort of executive or legislative agenda, and was not marketed as such. DOGE, on the other hand, in writing, appears to strive for the same goal, although Elon's behavior on X seems to make it sound as though the job is actually auditing other departments for "waste and fraud," where "waste" can also just mean "things Trump doesn't like."

- Around January 31st, Jason Gray (the Acting Administrator of USAID) allowed DOGE engineers access to the entire digital network.
    - According to a [ProPublica article](https://www.propublica.org/article/usaid-trump-musk-destruction-may-have-broken-law) citing John Davisson, director of litigation at Electronic Privacy Information Center, it's possible this was a violation of the Privacy Act of 1974.
    - The same article claims there could be violations of the Administrative Procedures Act and the Impoundment Control Act.
- On the [1st of February](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/usaid-security-leaders-removed-refusing-elon-musks-doge-employees-acce-rcna190357), USAID security personnel (director of security, John Vorhees, and his deputy, Brian McGill) were put on administrative leave after they refused to allow DOGE employees to gain access to secure USAID systems. The Doge employees threatened to call the U.S. Marshall and were eventually allowed some access.
    - Shortly after, the top human resources officer was also put on leave after he refused to put on leave 1,400 additional staffers.
    - The same happened afterwards with the labor director, he detailed [in an email](https://x.com/John_Hudson/status/1885122929022681141) to staff.
- Peter Marocco, the director of foreign affairs at the State Department, drafted [an order](https://x.com/prem_thakker/status/1886921967464329450) on February 4th after Musk's engineers arrived at the USAID offices, requiring American-funded aid projects around the world to close down.
- On February 7th, 2025, Steve Davis (the Acting US Attorney in Washington), [threatened](https://x.com/EricColumbus/status/1887904091889647824) to "chase them to the end of the Earth", threatening anyone who stood in DOGE's way.
- On February 7th, a Judge in the US District Court of DC [granted](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.277213/gov.uscourts.dcd.277213.15.0_2.pdf) a TRO to protect USAID workers in foreign environments from harm due to lack of access to security resources, and due to the expedited evacuation demand (30 days) placed on all of the workers. The order is in effect until February 14th, 2025.
