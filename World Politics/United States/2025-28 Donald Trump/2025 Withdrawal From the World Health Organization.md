- No Explicit Withdrawal Clause: The WHO Constitution does not contain an explicit provision for withdrawal. According to the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, a party generally cannot withdraw from such a treaty unless it was the intent of the parties to allow it, or a right to withdraw can be implied by the nature of the agreement.
- U.S. Reservation: When the U.S. joined the WHO in 1948, Congress passed a joint resolution that included a specific reservation, explicitly reserving the right to withdraw upon one year's notice, provided all financial obligations for the current fiscal year were met in full. This reservation, accepted by the World Health Assembly, provides a specific legal pathway for the U.S. to exit under international law that is not available to other member states.
