# Background
- On 11 April 2024, Trump hosed a 20-person roundtable with top oil and gas executives at his Mar-a-Lago Club in which he said he was committed to removing Biden-era EPA policies. Trump was given pre-made executive orders by the executives to sign for if/when he became president to sign on day one. In exchange, Trump said that it would be a deal if they are able to raise $1 Billion for his campaign.
	- `As Donald Trump sat with some of the country’s top oil executives at his Mar-a-Lago Club last month, one executive complained about how they continued to face burdensome environmental regulations despite spending $400 million to lobby the Biden administration in the last year.`
	  
	  `Trump’s response stunned several of the executives in the room overlooking the ocean: You all are wealthy enough, he said, that you should raise $1 billion to return me to the White House. At the dinner, he vowed to immediately reverse dozens of President Biden’s environmental rules and policies and stop new ones from being enacted, according to people with knowledge of the meeting, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a private conversation.`
	  
	  `Giving $1 billion would be a “deal,” Trump said, because of the taxation and regulation they would avoid thanks to him, according to the people.`
	  
	  `Trump’s remarkably blunt and transactional pitch reveals how the former president is targeting the oil industry to finance his reelection bid. At the same time, he has turned to the industry to help shape his environmental agenda for a second term, including rollbacks of some of Biden’s signature achievements on clean energy and electric vehicles.` - [Trump seeks $1 billion from oil CEOs, vows to limit EVs, The Washington Post, 2024](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/05/09/trump-oil-industry-campaign-money/)
	- `The U.S. oil industry is drawing up ready-to-sign executive orders for Donald Trump aimed at pushing natural gas exports, cutting drilling costs and increasing offshore oil leases in case he wins a second term, according to energy executives with direct knowledge of the work.`
	  
	  `The effort stems from the industry’s skepticism that the Trump campaign will be able to focus on energy issues as Election Day draws closer — and worries that the former president is too distracted to prepare a quick reversal of the Biden administration’s green policies. Oil executives also worry that a second Trump administration won’t attract staff skillful enough to roll back President Joe Biden’s regulations or craft new ones favoring the industry, these people added.`
	  
	  `Six energy industry lawyers and lobbyists interviewed by POLITICO described the effort to craft executive orders and other policy paperwork that they see as more effective than anything a second Trump administration could devise on its own. Those include a quick reversal of Biden’s pause on new natural gas export permits and preparations for wider and cheaper access to federal lands and waters for drilling.` - [‘A little bold and gross’: Oil industry writes executive orders for Trump to sign, POLITICO, 2024](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/08/oil-industry-orders-trump-day-one-00156705)
- On 13 August 2024, The Washington Post reported that the founder of Continental Resources, Harold Hamm, was the rallying leader of the Executives to attend the Trump Mar-a-Lago dinner and a FEC receipt shows soon after that dinner, donated $1 Million to Trump's Save America PAC.
	- `After Donald Trump asked the oil industry to contribute $1 billion to his presidential campaign in April, oil baron Harold Hamm immediately started working the phones.`
	  
	  `Hamm, the billionaire founder of Continental Resources, called other oil executives and encouraged them to attend fundraisers and open their wallets, according to people with knowledge of the outreach who, like others interviewed for this article, spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private discussions.`
	  
	  `“We’ve got to do this because it’s the most important election in our lifetime,” Hamm said as he made calls after the April dinner at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Club, where the former president made the audacious fundraising ask, according to an associate.` - [Why oil tycoon Harold Hamm is raising millions to elect Trump in 2024, The Washington Post, 2024](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/13/oil-donors-trump-pac-harold-hamm-election/)

# Day One Executive Orders
- On 20 January 2025, Trump signed Executive Order 14154 `Unleashing American Energy`.
	- `America is blessed with an abundance of energy and natural resources that have historically powered our Nation’s economic prosperity.  In recent years, burdensome and ideologically motivated regulations have impeded the development of these resources, limited the generation of reliable and affordable electricity, reduced job creation, and inflicted high energy costs upon our citizens.  These high energy costs devastate American consumers by driving up the cost of transportation, heating, utilities, farming, and manufacturing, while weakening our national security.`
	  
	  `It is thus in the national interest to unleash America’s affordable and reliable energy and natural resources.  This will restore American prosperity —- including for those men and women who have been forgotten by our economy in recent years.  It will also rebuild our Nation’s economic and military security, which will deliver peace through strength.` - [Unleashing American Energy, The White House, 2025](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/)
	- `to eliminate the “electric vehicle (EV) mandate” and promote true consumer choice, which is essential for economic growth and innovation, by removing regulatory barriers to motor vehicle access; by ensuring a level regulatory playing field for consumer choice in vehicles; by terminating, where appropriate, state emissions waivers that function to limit sales of gasoline-powered automobiles; and by considering the elimination of unfair subsidies and other ill-conceived government-imposed market distortions that favor EVs over other technologies and effectively mandate their purchase by individuals, private businesses, and government entities alike by rendering other types of vehicles unaffordable;` - [Unleashing American Energy, The White House, 2025](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/)
	- `Sec. 3.  Immediate Review of All Agency Actions that Potentially Burden the Development of Domestic Energy Resources.  (a)  The heads of all agencies shall review all existing regulations, orders, guidance documents, policies, settlements, consent orders, and any other agency actions (collectively, agency actions) to identify those agency actions that impose an undue burden on the identification, development, or use of domestic energy resources — with particular attention to oil, natural gas, coal, hydropower, biofuels, critical mineral, and nuclear energy resources — or that are otherwise inconsistent with the policy set forth in section 2 of this order, including restrictions on consumer choice of vehicles and appliances.`
	  
	  `(b)  Within 30 days of the date of this order, the head of each agency shall, in consultation with the director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the National Economic Council (NEC), develop and begin implementing action plans to suspend, revise, or rescind all agency actions identified as unduly burdensome under subsection (a) of this section, as expeditiously as possible and consistent with applicable law.  The head of any agency who determines that such agency does not have agency actions described in subsection (a) of this section shall submit to the Director of OMB a written statement to that effect and, absent a determination by the Director of OMB that such agency does have agency actions described in this subsection, shall have no further responsibilities under this section.` - [Unleashing American Energy, The White House, 2025](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/)
	- `Sec. 5.  Unleashing Energy Dominance through Efficient Permitting.  (a)  Executive Order 11991 of May 24, 1977 (Relating to protection and enhancement of environmental quality) is hereby revoked.`
	  
	  `(b)  To expedite and simplify the permitting process, within 30 days of the date of this order, the Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) shall provide guidance on implementing the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq., and propose rescinding CEQ’s NEPA regulations found at 40 CFR 1500 et seq.`
	  
	  `(c)  Following the provision of the guidance, the Chairman of CEQ shall convene a working group to coordinate the revision of agency-level implementing regulations for consistency. The guidance in subsection (b) and any resulting implementing regulations must expedite permitting approvals and meet deadlines established in the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 (Public Law 118-5).  Consistent with applicable law, all agencies must prioritize efficiency and certainty over any other objectives, including those of activist groups, that do not align with the policy goals set forth in section 2 of this order or that could otherwise add delays and ambiguity to the permitting process.`
	  
	  `(d)  The Secretaries of Defense, Interior, Agriculture, Commerce, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, Energy, Homeland Security, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Chairman of CEQ, and the heads of any other relevant agencies shall undertake all available efforts to eliminate all delays within their respective permitting processes, including through, but not limited to, the use of general permitting and permit by rule.  For any project an agency head deems essential for the Nation’s economy or national security, agencies shall use all possible authorities, including emergency authorities, to expedite the adjudication of Federal permits.  Agencies shall work closely with project sponsors to realize the ultimate construction or development of permitted projects.` - [Unleashing American Energy, The White House, 2025](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/)
		- `Day One Executive Order. To initiate the review and reorganization, a Day One executive order should be drafted for the incoming President with explicit language requiring reconsideration of the agency’s structure with reference to fulfilling its mission to create a better environmental tomorrow with clean air, safe water, healthy soil, and thriving communities.` - [Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership: The Conservative Promise, 2025 Presidential Transition Project, 2023](https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf)
