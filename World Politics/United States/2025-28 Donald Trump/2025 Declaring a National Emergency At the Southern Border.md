# Background
- In the UN Refugee Convention 1951, Article 31 states that refugees cannot be penalized for entering the country illegally to claim asylum.
    - `The Contracting States shall not impose penalties, on account of their illegal entry or presence, on refugees who, coming directly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened in the sense of Article 1, enter or are present in their territory without authorization, provided they present themselves without delay to the authorities and show good cause for their illegal entry or presence.` [link](https://www.unhcr.org/libraries/pdf.js/web/viewer.html?file=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.unhcr.org%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Flegacy-pdf%2F4ca34be29.pdf?version1692333666)
