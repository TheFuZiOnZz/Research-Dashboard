[Deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation_of_Kilmar_Abrego_Garcia)
# Background
- Abrego Garcia was born in the Los Nogales neighborhood of San Salvador, El Salvador, the Barrio 18 criminal gang tried to extort his mother's food business for money and threatened that if she did not pay the money, they would force her eldest son, Cesar, to join the gang; the gang later threatened to kill him. As a result, the family paid the money and hid Cesar, eventually sending him to the United States. Barrio 18 then turned its attention to Kilmar, who was around 12 years old. The gang followed Kilmar and continued to threaten his family. Eventually, when Kilmar was 16 years old, his family sent him to the U.S. as well. Court documents indicate that around 2011 or 2012, he illegally crossed the Mexicoâ€“U.S. border near McAllen, Texas.
- From the U.S. border, Abrego Garcia traveled to Maryland in order to live with his brother Cesar, who became a US citizen. In 2016, Abrego Garcia met Jennifer Vasquez Sura, a U.S. citizen who would become his wife. After marrying, the couple had one child, whom they raised alongside Vasquez Sura's two children from an earlier relationship. All three children have special needs; the son born to the couple has autism, a hearing defect, and is "unable to communicate verbally". Abrego Garcia lived in Maryland with his family, and was not formally convicted of any criminal offense, including gang membership, in the US or in El Salvador.
