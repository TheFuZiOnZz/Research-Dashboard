# Main Point
- On 20 January 2025, Trump signed executive order 14168, that strictly defined sex and gender. The executive order required federal workers to genuflect to that definition, possibly in violation of their First Amendment rights. He unilaterally changed the rules around gender designation on passports, uh, possible violation of the APA and also potentially violating due process rights, especially for trans individuals. The order also froze funding for a variety of entities that Trump claimed were promoting the vaguely defined gender ideology, which punished First Amendment protected speech and obviously was a usurpation of Congress's spending powers and an unlawful empoundment.
