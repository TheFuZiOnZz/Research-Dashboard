# Background
- On 15 March 2025, the U.S. began launching airstrikes on Houthi targets in Yemen due to the ongoing piracy campaign conducted by to support Hamas and the Palestinians in the [2023- Israel-Hamas War](../../Israel-Palestine/1948-%20Israeli-Palestinian%20Period/2023-%20Israel-Hamas%20War).
	- `The US has launched a "decisive and powerful" wave of air strikes on Houthi rebels in Yemen, President Donald Trump has said, citing the group's attacks on shipping in the Red Sea as the reason.`
	  
	  `"Funded by Iran, the Houthi thugs have fired missiles at US aircraft, and targeted our Troops and Allies," Trump said on social media, adding that their "piracy, violence, and terrorism" had cost "billions" and put lives at risk.`
	  
	  `The Houthi-run health ministry said at least 31 people were killed and 101 others were injured in the strikes.`
	  
	  `The group later said it would continue to target Red Sea shipping until Israel lifted its blockade of Gaza, and that its forces would respond to the strikes.`
	  
	  `The Houthis reported a series of explosions on Saturday evening in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, and in the northern province of Saada - the rebels' stronghold on the border with Saudi Arabia.`
	  
	  `The Iranian-backed rebel group, which considers Israel its enemy, controls Sanaa and the north-west of Yemen, but it is not the country's internationally recognised government.`
	  
	  `Unverified images show plumes of black smoke over the area of Sanaa's airport - which includes a military facility.`
	  
	  `In a statement, the Houthis blamed the US and the UK for "wicked" aggression targeting residential areas in Sanaa.` - [US launches wave of air strikes on Yemen's Houthis, BBC News, 2025](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c05mvr3j3yro)
	- `Today, I have ordered the United States Military to launch decisive and powerful Military action against the Houthi terrorists in Yemen. They have waged an unrelenting campaign of piracy, violence, and terrorism against American, and other, ships, aircraft, and drones.`
	  
	  `Joe Biden’s response was pathetically weak, so the unrestrained Houthis just kept going. It has been over a year since a U.S. flagged commercial ship safely sailed through the Suez Canal, the Red Sea, or the Gulf of Aden. The last American Warship to go through the Red Sea, four months ago, was attacked by the Houthis over a dozen times. Funded by Iran, the Houthi thugs have fired missiles at U.S. aircraft, and targeted our Troops and Allies. These relentless assaults have cost the U.S. and World Economy many BILLIONS of Dollars while, at the same time, putting innocent lives at risk.`
	  
	  `The Houthi attack on American vessels will not be tolerated. We will use overwhelming lethal force until we have achieved our objective. The Houthis have choked off shipping in one of the most important Waterways of the World, grinding vast swaths of Global Commerce to a halt, and attacking the core principle of Freedom of Navigation upon which International Trade and Commerce depends.`
	  
	  `Our brave Warfighters are right now carrying out aerial attacks on the terrorists’ bases, leaders, and missile defenses to protect American shipping, air, and naval assets, and to restore Navigational Freedom. No terrorist force will stop American commercial and naval vessels from freely sailing the Waterways of the World.`
	  
	  `To all Houthi terrorists, YOUR TIME IS UP, AND YOUR ATTACKS MUST STOP, STARTING TODAY. IF THEY DON’T, HELL WILL RAIN DOWN UPON YOU LIKE NOTHING YOU HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE!`
	  
	  `To Iran: Support for the Houthi terrorists must end IMMEDIATELY! Do NOT threaten the American People, their President, who has received one of the largest mandates in Presidential History, or Worldwide shipping lanes. If you do, BEWARE, because America will hold you fully accountable and, we won’t be nice about it!` - [@realDonaldTrump Post, Truth Social, 2025](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114167864888304754)
# Main Point
- On 24 March 2025, Jeffrey Goldberg, a writer for The Atlantic wrote in an op-ed that he was added to a Trump Administration Signal group chat in which discussed, before they happened, future strikes in Yemen. 
	- `The world found out shortly before 2 p.m. eastern time on March 15 that the United States was bombing Houthi targets across Yemen.`
	  
	  `I, however, knew two hours before the first bombs exploded that the attack might be coming. The reason I knew this is that Pete Hegseth, the secretary of defense, had texted me the war plan at 11:44 a.m. The plan included precise information about weapons packages, targets, and timing.` - [The Trump Administration Accidentally Texted Me Its War Plans, The Atlantic, 2025](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/trump-administration-accidentally-texted-me-its-war-plans/682151/)
	- `On Tuesday, March 11, I received a connection request on Signal from a user identified as Michael Waltz. Signal is an open-source encrypted messaging service popular with journalists and others who seek more privacy than other text-messaging services are capable of delivering. I assumed that the Michael Waltz in question was President Donald Trump’s national security adviser. I did not assume, however, that the request was from the actual Michael Waltz. I have met him in the past, and though I didn’t find it particularly strange that he might be reaching out to me, I did think it somewhat unusual, given the Trump administration’s contentious relationship with journalists—and Trump’s periodic fixation on me specifically. It immediately crossed my mind that someone could be masquerading as Waltz in order to somehow entrap me. It is not at all uncommon these days for nefarious actors to try to induce journalists to share information that could be used against them.`
	  
	  `I accepted the connection request, hoping that this was the actual national security adviser, and that he wanted to chat about Ukraine, or Iran, or some other important matter.`
	  
	  `Two days later—Thursday—at 4:28 p.m., I received a notice that I was to be included in a Signal chat group. It was called the “Houthi PC small group.”` - [The Trump Administration Accidentally Texted Me Its War Plans, The Atlantic, 2025](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/trump-administration-accidentally-texted-me-its-war-plans/682151/)

	  `As the National Security Council stated, the White House is looking into how Goldberg’s number was inadvertently added to the thread.`
	  
	  `Thanks to the strong and decisive leadership of President Trump, and everyone in the group, the Houthi strikes were successful and effective. Terrorists were killed and that’s what matters most to President Trump.` - [@PressSec Tweet, Twitter, 2025](https://x.com/PressSec/status/1904512527699968437)

	  `Those are some really shitty war plans.`
	  
	  `This only proves one thing: Jeff Goldberg has never seen a war plan or an “attack plan” (as he now calls it). Not even close.`
