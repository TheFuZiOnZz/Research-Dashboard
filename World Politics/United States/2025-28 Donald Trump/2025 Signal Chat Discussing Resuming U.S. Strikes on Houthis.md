# Background
- On 15 March 2025, the U.S. began launching airstrikes on Houthi targets in Yemen due to the ongoing piracy campaign conducted by to support Hamas and the Palestinians in the [2023- Israel-Hamas War](../../Israel-Palestine/1948-%20Israeli-Palestinian%20Period/2023-%20Israel-Hamas%20War).
	- `The US has launched a "decisive and powerful" wave of air strikes on Houthi rebels in Yemen, President Donald Trump has said, citing the group's attacks on shipping in the Red Sea as the reason.`
	  
	  `"Funded by Iran, the Houthi thugs have fired missiles at US aircraft, and targeted our Troops and Allies," Trump said on social media, adding that their "piracy, violence, and terrorism" had cost "billions" and put lives at risk.`
	  
	  `The Houthi-run health ministry said at least 31 people were killed and 101 others were injured in the strikes.`
	  
	  `The group later said it would continue to target Red Sea shipping until Israel lifted its blockade of Gaza, and that its forces would respond to the strikes.`
	  
	  `The Houthis reported a series of explosions on Saturday evening in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, and in the northern province of Saada - the rebels' stronghold on the border with Saudi Arabia.`
	  
	  `The Iranian-backed rebel group, which considers Israel its enemy, controls Sanaa and the north-west of Yemen, but it is not the country's internationally recognised government.`
	  
	  `Unverified images show plumes of black smoke over the area of Sanaa's airport - which includes a military facility.`
	  
	  `In a statement, the Houthis blamed the US and the UK for "wicked" aggression targeting residential areas in Sanaa.` - [US launches wave of air strikes on Yemen's Houthis, BBC News, 2025](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c05mvr3j3yro)
	- `Today, I have ordered the United States Military to launch decisive and powerful Military action against the Houthi terrorists in Yemen. They have waged an unrelenting campaign of piracy, violence, and terrorism against American, and other, ships, aircraft, and drones.`
	  
	  `Joe Biden’s response was pathetically weak, so the unrestrained Houthis just kept going. It has been over a year since a U.S. flagged commercial ship safely sailed through the Suez Canal, the Red Sea, or the Gulf of Aden. The last American Warship to go through the Red Sea, four months ago, was attacked by the Houthis over a dozen times. Funded by Iran, the Houthi thugs have fired missiles at U.S. aircraft, and targeted our Troops and Allies. These relentless assaults have cost the U.S. and World Economy many BILLIONS of Dollars while, at the same time, putting innocent lives at risk.`
	  
	  `The Houthi attack on American vessels will not be tolerated. We will use overwhelming lethal force until we have achieved our objective. The Houthis have choked off shipping in one of the most important Waterways of the World, grinding vast swaths of Global Commerce to a halt, and attacking the core principle of Freedom of Navigation upon which International Trade and Commerce depends.`
	  
	  `Our brave Warfighters are right now carrying out aerial attacks on the terrorists’ bases, leaders, and missile defenses to protect American shipping, air, and naval assets, and to restore Navigational Freedom. No terrorist force will stop American commercial and naval vessels from freely sailing the Waterways of the World.`
	  
	  `To all Houthi terrorists, YOUR TIME IS UP, AND YOUR ATTACKS MUST STOP, STARTING TODAY. IF THEY DON’T, HELL WILL RAIN DOWN UPON YOU LIKE NOTHING YOU HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE!`
	  
	  `To Iran: Support for the Houthi terrorists must end IMMEDIATELY! Do NOT threaten the American People, their President, who has received one of the largest mandates in Presidential History, or Worldwide shipping lanes. If you do, BEWARE, because America will hold you fully accountable and, we won’t be nice about it!` - [@realDonaldTrump Post, Truth Social, 2025](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114167864888304754)
# Main Point
- On 24 March 2025, Jeffrey Goldberg, a writer for The Atlantic wrote in an op-ed that he was added to a Trump Administration Signal group chat in which discussed, before they happened, future strikes in Yemen. 
	- `The world found out shortly before 2 p.m. eastern time on March 15 that the United States was bombing Houthi targets across Yemen.`
	  
	  `I, however, knew two hours before the first bombs exploded that the attack might be coming. The reason I knew this is that Pete Hegseth, the secretary of defense, had texted me the war plan at 11:44 a.m. The plan included precise information about weapons packages, targets, and timing.` - [The Trump Administration Accidentally Texted Me Its War Plans, The Atlantic, 2025](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/trump-administration-accidentally-texted-me-its-war-plans/682151/)
	- `On Tuesday, March 11, I received a connection request on Signal from a user identified as Michael Waltz. Signal is an open-source encrypted messaging service popular with journalists and others who seek more privacy than other text-messaging services are capable of delivering. I assumed that the Michael Waltz in question was President Donald Trump’s national security adviser. I did not assume, however, that the request was from the actual Michael Waltz. I have met him in the past, and though I didn’t find it particularly strange that he might be reaching out to me, I did think it somewhat unusual, given the Trump administration’s contentious relationship with journalists—and Trump’s periodic fixation on me specifically. It immediately crossed my mind that someone could be masquerading as Waltz in order to somehow entrap me. It is not at all uncommon these days for nefarious actors to try to induce journalists to share information that could be used against them.`
	  
	  `I accepted the connection request, hoping that this was the actual national security adviser, and that he wanted to chat about Ukraine, or Iran, or some other important matter.`
	  
	  `Two days later—Thursday—at 4:28 p.m., I received a notice that I was to be included in a Signal chat group. It was called the “Houthi PC small group.”` - [The Trump Administration Accidentally Texted Me Its War Plans, The Atlantic, 2025](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/trump-administration-accidentally-texted-me-its-war-plans/682151/)
	- `It was the next morning, Saturday, March 15, when this story became truly bizarre.`
	  
	  `At 11:44 a.m., the account labeled “Pete Hegseth” posted in Signal a “TEAM UPDATE.” I will not quote from this update, or from certain other subsequent texts. The information contained in them, if they had been read by an adversary of the United States, could conceivably have been used to harm American military and intelligence personnel, particularly in the broader Middle East, Central Command’s area of responsibility. What I will say, in order to illustrate the shocking recklessness of this Signal conversation, is that the Hegseth post contained operational details of forthcoming strikes on Yemen, including information about targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying, and attack sequencing.`
	  
	  `The only person to reply to the update from Hegseth was the person identified as the vice president. “I will say a prayer for victory,” Vance wrote. (Two other users subsequently added prayer emoji.)` - [The Trump Administration Accidentally Texted Me Its War Plans, The Atlantic, 2025](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/trump-administration-accidentally-texted-me-its-war-plans/682151/)
	- `I have never seen a breach quite like this. It is not uncommon for national-security officials to communicate on Signal. But the app is used primarily for meeting planning and other logistical matters—not for detailed and highly confidential discussions of a pending military action. And, of course, I’ve never heard of an instance in which a journalist has been invited to such a discussion.`
	  
	  `Conceivably, Waltz, by coordinating a national-security-related action over Signal, may have violated several provisions of the Espionage Act, which governs the handling of “national defense” information, according to several national-security lawyers interviewed by my colleague Shane Harris for this story. Harris asked them to consider a hypothetical scenario in which a senior U.S. official creates a Signal thread for the express purpose of sharing information with Cabinet officials about an active military operation. He did not show them the actual Signal messages or tell them specifically what had occurred.`
	  
	  `All of these lawyers said that a U.S. official should not establish a Signal thread in the first place. Information about an active operation would presumably fit the law’s definition of “national defense” information. The Signal app is not approved by the government for sharing classified information. The government has its own systems for that purpose. If officials want to discuss military activity, they should go into a specially designed space known as a sensitive compartmented information facility, or SCIF—most Cabinet-level national-security officials have one installed in their home—or communicate only on approved government equipment, the lawyers said. Normally, cellphones are not permitted inside a SCIF, which suggests that as these officials were sharing information about an active military operation, they could have been moving around in public. Had they lost their phones, or had they been stolen, the potential risk to national security would have been severe.`
	  
	  `Hegseth, Ratcliffe, and other Cabinet-level officials presumably would have the authority to declassify information, and several of the national-security lawyers noted that the hypothetical officials on the Signal chain might claim that they had declassified the information they shared. But this argument rings hollow, they cautioned, because Signal is not an authorized venue for sharing information of such a sensitive nature, regardless of whether it has been stamped “top secret” or not.` - [The Trump Administration Accidentally Texted Me Its War Plans, The Atlantic, 2025](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/trump-administration-accidentally-texted-me-its-war-plans/682151/)
	- `Waltz and the other Cabinet-level officials were already potentially violating government policy and the law simply by texting one another about the operation. But when Waltz added a journalist—presumably by mistake—to his principals committee, he created new security and legal issues. Now the group was transmitting information to someone not authorized to receive it. That is the classic definition of a leak, even if it was unintentional, and even if the recipient of the leak did not actually believe it was a leak until Yemen came under American attack.`
	  
	  `All along, members of the Signal group were aware of the need for secrecy and operations security. In his text detailing aspects of the forthcoming attack on Houthi targets, Hegseth wrote to the group—which, at the time, included me—“We are currently clean on OPSEC.”` - [The Trump Administration Accidentally Texted Me Its War Plans, The Atlantic, 2025](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/trump-administration-accidentally-texted-me-its-war-plans/682151/)
- On 24 March 2025, Pete Hegseth claimed that no war plans were discussed in the group chat and proceeded to disparage Goldberg, in which Goldberg later replied to Hegseth's comments saying that was a lie.
	- `What they're saying: Hegseth, who briefly spoke to reporters after landing in Hawaii Monday, lashed out at Goldberg for The Atlantic's history of publishing negative stories about President Trump.`
	  
	  `"You're talking about a deceitful and highly discredited so-called 'journalist' who's made a profession of peddling hoaxes time and time again," Hegseth said, attacking Goldberg's reporting on the Russia investigation and allegations that Trump called fallen veterans "suckers and losers."`
	  
	  `egseth went on to defend Trump's March 15 airstrikes against the Houthis, an Iranian-backed militia group that has disrupted billions of dollars by blockading commercial shipping lanes in the Red Sea.`
	  
	  `Asked why details of the operation were shared on Signal, an encrypted messaging app available to the public, Hegseth denied that part of Goldberg's reporting.`
	  
	  `"I've heard how it was characterized. Nobody was texting war plans. And that's all I have to say about that," the former Fox News host said.`
	  
	  `The latest: Goldberg later responded to Hegseth on MSNBC, alleging that the texts he withheld included "precise details" of the attack on the Houthis — including the specific time, specific targets and sequencing of the operation.`
	  
	  `"He can say that it wasn't a war plan, but it was a minute-by-minute accounting of what was about to happen, organized by CENTCOM ... and [shared] with a bunch of civilian leaders," Goldberg said.` - [Hegseth slams The Atlantic: "Nobody was texting war plans", Axios,](https://www.axios.com/2025/03/24/hegseth-trump-atlantic-yemen-houthis-text-war-plan)
- On 25 March 2025, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt tweeted that Goldberg lied in relation to 
	- `Jeffrey Goldberg is well-known for his sensationalist spin. Here are the facts about his latest story:`
	  
	  `1. No “war plans” were discussed.`
	  
	  `2. No classified material was sent to the thread.`
	  
	  `3. The White House Counsel’s Office has provided guidance on a number of different platforms for President Trump’s top officials to communicate as safely and efficiently as possible.`
	  
	  `As the National Security Council stated, the White House is looking into how Goldberg’s number was inadvertently added to the thread.`
	  
	  `Thanks to the strong and decisive leadership of President Trump, and everyone in the group, the Houthi strikes were successful and effective. Terrorists were killed and that’s what matters most to President Trump.` - [@PressSec Tweet, Twitter, 2025](https://x.com/PressSec/status/1904512527699968437)
- On 25 March 2025, DNI Director Tulsi Gabbard, FBI Director Kash Patel and CIA Director John Ratcliffe testify on global threats in a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing, in which the Signal messages were discussed.

- On 25 March 2025, Trump blamed a Michael Waltz staffer for adding Goldberg to the group chat and said it had no effect on the strikes execution.
	- `President Donald Trump revealed that a staffer with national security advisor Mike Waltz's office included the editor-in-chief of the Atlantic in a Signal group chat with senior Trump officials who were discussing plans for an upcoming strike on Houthi rebels in Yemen.`
	  
	  `"It was one of Michael’s people on the phone. A staffer had his number on there," Trump told NBC in a phone interview when asked how Jeffrey Goldberg, the Atlantic's editor-in-chief, was added to the high-profile chat.`

- On 25 March 2025, Michael Waltz told Fox News host Laura Ingraham that he took responsibility for adding Goldberg to the group chat.
	- `National security advisor Michael Waltz assumed "full responsibility" for a leaked Signal group chat of senior Trump officials that discussed plans for a forthcoming strike on the Houthis in Yemen.`
	  
	  `"I take full responsibility. I built the group," Waltz said on "The Ingraham Angle" Tuesday. "It's embarrassing.
