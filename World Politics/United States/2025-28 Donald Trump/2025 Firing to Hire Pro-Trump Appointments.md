Trump reinstated the so-called schedule F without going through any notice and comment process, potentially firing federal employees without going through the usual merit system protection process, a violation of the APA and civil service protections.
[Schedule F appointment - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schedule_F_appointment)

Trump unilaterally froze hiring in the government without any congressional authorization.

Trump issued a memo making it easier for him to fire senior non-political leaders at government agencies. This was an effort to prioritize loyalty and filty in violation of civil service protections and probably the First Amendment.
