- On February 26, we see Trump's MAGA hats, that are for sale on his website, displayed in the Oval Office. And it's just a reminder that so many people inside Trump's universe continue to sell merchandise on the side in order to make money. Donald Trump has always done this, and we've just accepted it, even though it is a kind of corruption in and of itself. But Kash Patel, the Director of the FBI, is still selling Kash-branded merchandise even while he's going to run the FBI. Elon Musk and others are selling DOGE merchandise. So as they trumpet their brand inside the government, theyâ€™re making money off their brand outside of the government.
