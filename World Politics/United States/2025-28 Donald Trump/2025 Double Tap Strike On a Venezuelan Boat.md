- Executive Order 14157
	- `The Cartels have engaged in a campaign of violence and terror throughout the Western Hemisphere that has not only destabilized countries with significant importance for our national interests but also flooded the United States with deadly drugs, violent criminals, and vicious gangs.`
	  
	  `The Cartels functionally control, through a campaign of assassination, terror, rape, and brute force nearly all illegal traffic across the southern border of the United States.  In certain portions of Mexico, they function as quasi-governmental entities, controlling nearly all aspects of society.  The Cartels’ activities threaten the safety of the American people, the security of the United States, and the stability of the international order in the Western Hemisphere.  Their activities, proximity to, and incursions into the physical territory of the United States pose an unacceptable national security risk to the United States.`
	  
	  `(b)  Other transnational organizations, such as Tren de Aragua (TdA) and La Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) pose similar threats to the United States.  Their campaigns of violence and terror in the United States and internationally are extraordinarily violent, vicious, and similarly threaten the stability of the international order in the Western Hemisphere.`
	  
	  `(c)  The Cartels and other transnational organizations, such as TdA and MS-13, operate both within and outside the United States.  They present an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.  I hereby declare a national emergency, under IEEPA, to deal with those threats.` - [Designating Cartels And Other Organizations As Foreign Terrorist Organizations And Specially Designated Global Terrorists, The White House, 2025](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/designating-cartels-and-other-organizations-as-foreign-terrorist-organizations-and-specially-designated-global-terrorists/)
# Main Point
- On 2 September 2025, Trump announced that a military vessel struck and sank a speedboat that it alleged was smuggling drugs from Venezuela to the United States during a high-seas interdiction mission.
	- `Earlier this morning, on my Orders, U.S. Military Forces conducted a kinetic strike against positively identified Tren de Aragua Narcoterrorists in the SOUTHCOM area of responsibility. TDA is a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization, operating under the control of Nicolas Maduro, responsible for mass murder, drug trafficking, sex trafficking, and acts of violence and terror across the United States and Western Hemisphere. The strike occurred while the terrorists were at sea in International waters transporting illegal narcotics, heading to the United States. The strike resulted in 11 terrorists killed in action. No U.S. Forces were harmed in this strike. Please let this serve as notice to anybody even thinking about bringing drugs into the United States of America. BEWARE! Thank you for your attention to this matter!!!!!!!!!!!` - [@realDonaldTrump Post, Truth Social, 2025](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115136798909755892)
- On 2 September 2025, Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that the boat was not heading for the United States, contradicting Trump.
	- `“The president is very clear that he’s going to use the full power of America, the full might of the United States, to take on and eradicate these drug cartels, no matter where they’re operating from, and no matter how long they’ve been able to act with impunity,” said Secretary of State Marco Rubio before boarding a plane in Florida to head to Mexico.`
	  
	  `In a deviation from Mr. Trump’s account, however, Mr. Rubio said that the vessel’s destination was probably Trinidad or another country in the Caribbean.` - [Trump Says U.S. Attacked Boat Carrying Venezuelan Gang Members, Killing 11, The New York Times, 2025](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/02/us/politics/trump-venezuela-boat-drugs-attack.html)
- On 2 September 2025, JD Vance tweeted that the military strikes being conducted was the best use of the military. A reply stated that this was a war crime, Vance responded with `I don’t give a shit what you call it`.
	- `Killing cartel members who poison our fellow citizens is the highest and best use of our military.` - [@JDVance Tweet, Twitter (X), 2025](https://x.com/JDVance/status/1964341094226743787)

- On 28 November 2025, The Washington Post reported that Department of War Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered all people suspected of ferrying drugs to be killed. Due to this verbal command, the 2 September incident actually featured two separate strikes on the boat featured in the Trump Truth Social post.
	- `The longer the U.S. surveillance aircraft followed the boat, the more confident intelligence analysts watching from command centers became that the 11 people on board were ferrying drugs.`
	  
	  `Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth gave a spoken directive, according to two people with direct knowledge of the operation. “The order was to kill everybody,” one of them said.`
	  
	  `A missile screamed off the Trinidad coast, striking the vessel and igniting a blaze from bow to stern. For minutes, commanders watched the boat burning on a live drone feed. As the smoke cleared, they got a jolt: Two survivors were clinging to the smoldering wreck.`
	  
	  `The Special Operations commander overseeing the Sept. 2 attack — the opening salvo in the Trump administration’s war on suspected drug traffickers in the Western Hemisphere — ordered a second strike to comply with Hegseth’s instructions, two people familiar with the matter said. The two men were blown apart in the water.`
	  
	  `Hegseth’s order, which has not been previously reported, adds another dimension to the campaign against suspected drug traffickers. Some current and former U.S. officials and law-of-war experts have said that the Pentagon’s lethal campaign — which has killed more than 80 people to date — is unlawful and may expose those most directly involved to future prosecution.` - [Hegseth order on first Caribbean boat strike, officials say: Kill them all, Washington Post, 2025](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/11/28/hegseth-kill-them-all-survivors-boat-strike)
- On 28 November 2025, Hegseth tweeted that the Washington Post story was fake news and that the strikes were lawful under U.S. and International Law.
	- `As usual, the fake news is delivering more fabricated, inflammatory, and derogatory reporting to discredit our incredible warriors fighting to protect the homeland.`
	  
	  `As we’ve said from the beginning, and in every statement, these highly effective strikes are specifically intended to be “lethal, kinetic strikes.” The declared intent is to stop lethal drugs, destroy narco-boats, and kill the narco-terrorists who are poisoning the American people. Every trafficker we kill is affiliated with a Designated Terrorist Organization.`
	  
	  `The Biden administration preferred the kid gloves approach, allowing millions of people — including dangerous cartels and unvetted Afghans — to flood our communities with drugs and violence. The Trump administration has sealed the border and gone on offense against narco-terrorists. Biden coddled terrorists, we kill them.`
	  
	  `Our current operations in the Caribbean are lawful under both U.S. and international law, with all actions in compliance with the law of armed conflict—and approved by the best military and civilian lawyers, up and down the chain of command.`
	  
	  `Our warriors in SOUTHCOM put their lives on the line every day to protect the Homeland from narco-terrorists — and I will ALWAYS have their back.` - [@SecWar Tweet, Twitter (X), 2025](https://x.com/SecWar/status/1994552598142038358)
- On 2 December 2025, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that there was a second strike and that the Head of the Joint Special Operations Command, Admiral Frank Bradley worked within his authority.
	- `The White House confirmed Monday that the U.S. did launch a second strike on an alleged drug boat from Venezuela in early September and that it was ordered by Adm. Frank M. Bradley, who at the time headed the Joint Special Operations Command.`
	  
	  `The follow-up strike killed the survivors of an initial U.S. strike on the vessel, which the Trump administration has said originated from Venezuela. Some lawmakers and legal experts say that second attack could constitute a war crime.`
	  
	  `“With respect to the strikes in question on Sept. 2, Secretary Hegseth authorized Adm. Bradley to conduct these kinetic strikes,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement during Monday's briefing.`
	  
	  `“Adm. Bradley worked well within his authority and the law directing the engagement to ensure the boat was destroyed and the threat to the United States of America was eliminated," she added.`
	  
	  `U.S. Special Operations Command, which Bradley now leads as commander, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.` - [White House confirms second Sept. 2 strike on alleged drug boat, NBC News, 2025](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/white-house-confirms-second-sept-2-strike-alleged-drug-boat-rcna246834)
