			  `17.14.1.1 Types of Persons Who Are Considered Wounded, Sick, and Shipwrecked in NIAC. The wounded, sick, and shipwrecked in non-international armed conflict may be understood to include:`
			  
			  `persons who have been rendered unconscious or otherwise have been incapacitated because of their wounds, sickness, or shipwreck;`
			  
			  `persons who have surrendered as a consequence of their health; and`
			  
			  `persons who have been shipwrecked (i.e., helpless persons in distress at sea or stranded on the coast) from any cause, including forced landings at sea by or from aircraft.`
			  
			  `Of course, any person who commits hostile acts or or attempts to evade capture forfeits protection as someone who is placed hors de combat.`
			  
			  `17.14.1.2 Meaning of “Respect and Protection” of the Wounded, Sick, and Shipwrecked. The wounded, sick, and shipwrecked must be respected and protected at all times. This means that they should not be knowingly attacked, fired upon, or unnecessarily interfered with.`
			  
			  `Persons who are part of armed forces or groups, however, are deemed to have accepted the risk of harm due to deliberate proximity to military objectives. Although the presence of such persons does not serve to exempt nearby military objectives from attack due to the risk that such persons would be incidentally harmed, feasible precautions to reduce the risk of harm to such persons who are wounded, sick, or shipwrecked must be taken.`
			  
			  `The respect and protection afforded the wounded, sick, and shipwrecked do not immunize them from search, or other necessary security measures, or capture and detention, even if they are receiving medical care.`
			  
			  `Booby-trapping the wounded or sick is expressly prohibited.`
			  
			  `17.14.2 Humane Treatment and Practicable Medical Care and Attention. In all circumstances, the wounded, sick, and shipwrecked shall be treated humanely and shall receive, to the fullest extent practicable and with the least possible delay, the medical care and attention required by their condition.179 There shall be no distinction among them founded on any grounds other than medical ones.`
			  
			  `17.14.3 Search, Collection, and Protection of the Wounded, Sick, Shipwrecked, and Dead. Whenever circumstances permit, and particularly after an engagement, all possible measures shall be taken, without delay, to search for and collect the wounded, sick, and shipwrecked, to protect them against pillage and ill-treatment, to ensure their adequate care, and to search for the dead, prevent their being despoiled, and decently dispose of them.`
			  
			  `The obligations to search for, collect, and take affirmative steps to protect the wounded, sick, and shipwrecked are subject to practical limitations; military commanders are to judge what is possible, and to what extent they can commit their personnel to these duties.` - [Department of Defense Law of War Manual, U.S. Department of Defense](https://ogc.osd.mil/Portals/99/department_of_defense_law_of_war_manual.pdf)

		- Section 3, Duties of Individual Members of the Armed Forces.
			- `18.3.2 Refuse to Comply With Clearly Illegal Orders to Commit Law of War Violations. Members of the armed forces must refuse to comply with clearly illegal orders to commit law of war violations. In addition, orders should not be construed to authorize implicitly violations of law of war.`
			  
			  `18.3.2.1 Clearly Illegal Orders to Commit Law of War Violations. The requirement to refuse to comply with orders to commit law of war violations applies to orders to perform conduct that is clearly illegal or orders that the subordinate knows, in fact, are illegal. For example, orders to fire upon the shipwrecked would be clearly illegal. Similarly, orders to kill defenseless persons who have submitted to and are under effective physical control would also be clearly illegal. On the other hand, the duty not to comply with orders that are clearly illegal would be limited in its application when the subordinate is not competent to evaluate whether the rule has been violated.`
			  
			  `Subordinates are not required to screen the orders of superiors for questionable points of legality, and may, absent specific knowledge to the contrary, presume that orders have been lawfully issued.`
			  
			  `18.3.2.2 Commands and Orders Should Not Be Understood as Implicitly Authorizing Violations of the Law of War. Commands and orders should not be understood as implicitly authorizing violations of the law of war where other interpretations are reasonably available.`
			  
			  `For example, if a commander issues an order to attack a town, one should assume that the order directs attacks on military objectives located in that area. Similarly, speeches by commanders before combat operations to rally members of their command should not be understood to authorize implicitly law of war violations against the enemy.`  - [Department of Defense Law of War Manual, U.S. Department of Defense](https://ogc.osd.mil/Portals/99/department_of_defense_law_of_war_manual.pdf)
- Office of Legal Counsel Memo, April 2018 Airstrikes Against Syrian Chemical-Weapons Facilities.
	- `We now explain our analysis of the April 13, 2018 Syrian strikes in light of our precedents. In evaluating whether a proposed military action falls within the President’s authority under Article II of the Constitution, we have distilled our precedents into two inquiries. First, we consider whether the President could reasonably determine that the action serves important national interests. See, e.g., Somalia Deployment, 16 O.L.C. at 9 (“At the core of this power is the President’s authority to take military action to protect American citizens, property, and interests from foreign threats.”); British Flying Students, 40 Op. Att’y Gen. at 62 (“[T]he President’s authority has long been recognized as extending to the dispatch of armed forces outside of the United States, either on missions of good will or rescue, or for purposes of protecting American lives or property or American interests.”). Second, we consider whether the “anticipated nature, scope, and duration” of the conflict might rise to the level of a war under the Constitution. See Libya Deployment, 35 Op. O.L.C. at 31 (quoting Haiti Deployment I, 18 Op. O.L.C. at 179). Prior to the Syrian strikes, we applied this framework to conclude that the proposed Syrian operation would fall within the President’s constitutional authority.`
	  
	  `This Office has recognized that a broad set of interests would justify use of the President’s Article II authority to direct military force. These interests understandably grant the President a great deal of discretion. The scope of U.S. involvement in the world, the presence of U.S. citizens across the globe, and U.S. leadership in times of conflict, crisis, and strife require that the President have wide latitude to protect American interests by responding to regional conflagrations and humanitarian catastrophes as he believes appropriate. The Commander in Chief bears great responsibility for the use of the armed forces and for putting U.S. forces in harm’s way. We would not expect that any President would use this power without a substantial basis for believing that a proposed operation is necessary to advance important interests of the Nation. The aim of this inquiry is not to evaluate the worth of the interests at stake—a question more of policy than of law—but rather, to set forth the justifications for the President’s use of military force and to situate those interests within a framework of prior precedents.`
	  
	  `In our past opinions, this Office has identified a number of different interests that have supported sending U.S. forces into harm’s way, including the following:`
	  
	  `the protection of U.S. persons and property, see, e.g., Presidential Power, 4A Op. O.L.C. at 187 (“Presidents have repeatedly employed troops abroad in defense of American lives and property.”); Haiti Deployment II, 28 Op. O.L.C. at 31 (“The President has the authority to deploy the armed forces abroad in order to protect American citizens and interests from foreign threats.”);`
	  
	  `assistance to allies, see, e.g., Haiti Deployment I, 18 Op. O.L.C. at 79 (approving of intervention “at the invitation of a fully legitimate government”); Presidential Power, 4A Op. O.L.C. at 187–88 (citing the Korean War as “precedent . . . for the commitment of United States armed forces, without prior congressional approval or declaration of war, to aid an ally in repelling an armed invasion”);`
	  
	  `support for the United Nations, see, e.g., Haiti Deployment II, 28 Op. O.L.C. at 33 (“Another American interest in Haiti arises from the involvement of the United Nations in the situation there.”); Somalia Deployment, 16 Op. O.L.C. at 11 (“[M]aintaining the credibility of United Nations Security Council decisions, protecting the security of United Nations and related relief efforts, and ensuring the effectiveness of United Nations peacekeeping operations can be considered a vital national interest[.]”); and`
	  
	  `promoting regional stability, see, e.g., Haiti Deployment II, 29 Op. O.L.C. at 32 (“The President also may determine that the deployment is necessary to protect American foreign policy interests. One such interest is the preservation of regional stability.”); Libya Deployment, 35 Op. O.L.C. at 36 (“[W]e believe the President could` - [April 2018 Airstrikes Against Syrian Chemical-Weapons Facilities, Office of Legal Counsel, 2018](https://www.justice.gov/olc/opinion/file/1067551/dl)

	- `The Cartels have engaged in a campaign of violence and terror throughout the Western Hemisphere that has not only destabilized countries with significant importance for our national interests but also flooded the United States with deadly drugs, violent criminals, and vicious gangs.`
	  
	  `The Cartels functionally control, through a campaign of assassination, terror, rape, and brute force nearly all illegal traffic across the southern border of the United States.  In certain portions of Mexico, they function as quasi-governmental entities, controlling nearly all aspects of society.  The Cartels’ activities threaten the safety of the American people, the security of the United States, and the stability of the international order in the Western Hemisphere.  Their activities, proximity to, and incursions into the physical territory of the United States pose an unacceptable national security risk to the United States.`
	  
	  `(b)  Other transnational organizations, such as Tren de Aragua (TdA) and La Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) pose similar threats to the United States.  Their campaigns of violence and terror in the United States and internationally are extraordinarily violent, vicious, and similarly threaten the stability of the international order in the Western Hemisphere.`
	  
	  `(c)  The Cartels and other transnational organizations, such as TdA and MS-13, operate both within and outside the United States.  They present an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.

# Main Point
- On 2 September 2025, Trump announced that a military vessel struck and sank a speedboat that it alleged was smuggling drugs from Venezuela to the United States during a high-seas interdiction mission.
	- `Earlier this morning, on my Orders, U.S. Military Forces conducted a kinetic strike against positively identified Tren de Aragua Narcoterrorists in the SOUTHCOM area of responsibility. TDA is a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization, operating under the control of Nicolas Maduro, responsible for mass murder, drug trafficking, sex trafficking, and acts of violence and terror across the United States and Western Hemisphere. The strike occurred while the terrorists were at sea in International waters transporting illegal narcotics, heading to the United States. The strike resulted in 11 terrorists killed in action. No U.S. Forces were harmed in this strike. Please let this serve as notice to anybody even thinking about bringing drugs into the United States of America. BEWARE! Thank you for your attention to this matter!!!!!!!!!!!` - [@realDonaldTrump Post, Truth Social, 2025](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115136798909755892)
- On 2 September 2025, Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that the boat was not heading for the United States, contradicting Trump.
	- `“The president is very clear that he’s going to use the full power of America, the full might of the United States, to take on and eradicate these drug cartels, no matter where they’re operating from, and no matter how long they’ve been able to act with impunity,” said Secretary of State Marco Rubio before boarding a plane in Florida to head to Mexico.`

- On 4 September 2025, in compliance with the War Powers Resolution of 1973, Trump provided a report to congress to notify them of current hostilities. the report cited to the presidents broad Article 2 constitutional powers as the Commander in Chief with no mention of any specifics about who was targeted and killed or their participation in any prior armed attack or imminent attack, which is required in the War Powers Resolution of 1973. And although the boat was supposed to be affiliated with Tren de Aragua, that detail is omitted here. The summary of what the boat was doing. Illicit trafficking does not say what was being trafficked and where it was going, ignoring the 2018 OLC memo. 
	- `Dear Mr. President:`
	  
	  `I write to apprise you of military action taken on September 2, 2025, in the Caribbean Sea and of the potential for further such actions.`
	  
	  `Extraordinarily violent drug trafficking cartels that the United States has designated as terrorist organizations have wrought devastating consequences on American communities for decades, causing the deaths of tens of thousands of United States citizens each year and threatening our national security and foreign policy interests both at home and abroad. These organizations have evolved into complex structures with the financial means and paramilitary capabilities needed to operate with impunity, engaging in violence and terrorism that threaten the United States and destabilize other nations in our own Hemisphere. Friendly foreign nations have made significant efforts to combat these organizations, suffering significant losses of life due to organized violence at the hands of the groups designated as terrorist organizations, but these groups are now transnational and operate throughout the Western Hemisphere.`
	  
	  `In the face of the inability or unwillingness of some states in the region to address the continuing threat to United States persons and interests emanating from their territories, we have now reached a critical point where we must meet this threat to our citizens and our most vital national interests with United States military force in self-defense. Accordingly, at my direction, on September 2, 2025, United States forces struck a vessel at a location beyond the territorial seas of any nation that was assessed to be affiliated with a designated terrorist organization and to be engaged in illicit drug trafficking activities.`
	  
	  `It is not possible at this time to know the full scope and duration of military operations that will be necessary. United States forces remain postured to carry out further military operations.`
	  
	  `I am providing this report as part Of my efforts to keep the Congress fully informed, consistent with the War Powers Resolution (Public Law 93-148). I directed these actions consistent with my responsibility to protect Americans and United States interests abroad and in furtherance of United States national security and foreign policy interests, pursuant to my constitutional authority as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive to conduct United States foreign relations.

- On 5 September 2025, Trump told reporters that overdoses occurring in the U.S. were equivalent to war dead and that Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro had ties to Tren de Aragua, of which Maduro Denies and that there is not good intelligence to conclude.
	- `At every turn, the Trump administration has sought to tie Maduro's government to narco trafficking, allegations Caracas denies.`
	  
	  `Specifically, Trump has accused Maduro of running the Tren de Aragua gang, which his administration designated a terrorist organization in February. Maduro has denied any connection to Tren de Aragua, which his government says was rendered inactive in Venezuela by a prison raid in 2023.`
	  
	  `Trump on Friday compared the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Americans in overdoses to war dead, as he sought to justify the muscular military activity in the Caribbean.`

		- `Bondi has not presented conclusive evidence of the Venezuelan leader’s alleged role in international drug trafficking. At the same time, Caracas has flatly rejected the claims.`
		  
		  `“For there to be a drug cartel, either you produce (the drugs), you process it or you traffic it. And if there is no cultivation, production, or drug trafficking in Venezuela, how can there be a cartel? It’s unsustainable,” Venezuelan congresswoman Blanca Eekhout told CNN, referring to _Cartel de los Soles_, an alleged drug trafficking organization that the United States claims is led by Maduro and that the Trump administration declared a terrorist organization a few weeks ago.`
		  
		  `According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), Venezuela is not a cocaine-producing country.`
		  
		  `Almost all coca crops – the main ingredient of cocaine – are concentrated in Colombia, Peru and Bolivia. Colombia in particular – has seen its cocaine production grow dramatically in recent years, due both to an increase in cultivation area (almost 100,000 hectares more since 2020) and, more significantly, because of higher yields in refining the product, according to UN researchers.`
		  
		  `In other words, more coca leaves are being grown, and at the same time, each leaf produces more cocaine. Of the 3,700 tons of coca produced worldwide, more than 2,500 tons come from Colombia, while Venezuela does not appear on production maps, according to the latest UNODC report published in June.`

- On 5 September 2025, Hegseth told reporters that Tren de Aragua is no different to al-Qaida.
	- `Days after the U.S. military [destroyed a boat in the Caribbean](https://taskandpurpose.com/news/drug-boat-southern-caribbean/) that it claimed was being used to smuggle drugs, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said that the legal basis for the strike lay in the status of the traffickers as an “imminent threat” to the United States.`
	  
	  `“A foreign terrorist organization poisoning your people with drugs coming from a drug cartel is no different than al-Qaida — and they’ll be treated as such, as they were in international waters,” Hegseth told reporters on Thursday.` - [Drug cartels are 'no different than al-Qaida,' Hegseth says, Task & Purpose, 2025](https://taskandpurpose.com/news/military-drug-cartels-terrorists/)
- On 12 November 2025, CNN reported that the U.K. stopped sharing some intelligence to the U.S.  regarding the Caribbean over the boat strikes.
	- `The United Kingdom is no longer sharing intelligence with the US about suspected drug trafficking vessels in the Caribbean because it does not want to be complicit in US military strikes and believes the attacks are illegal, sources familiar with the matter told CNN.`
	  
	  `The UK’s decision marks a significant break from its closest ally and intelligence sharing partner and underscores the growing skepticism over the legality of the US military’s campaign around Latin America.`
	  
	  `For years, the UK, which controls a number of territories in the Caribbean where it bases intelligence assets, has helped the US locate vessels suspected of carrying drugs so that the US Coast Guard could interdict them, the sources said. That meant the ships would be stopped, boarded, its crew detained, and drugs seized.` - [Exclusive: UK suspends some intelligence sharing with US over boat strike concerns in major break, CNN, 2025](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/11/11/politics/uk-suspends-caribbean-intelligence-sharing-us)
- On 28 November 2025, The Washington Post reported that Department of War Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered all people suspected of ferrying drugs to be killed. Due to this verbal command, the 2 September incident actually featured two separate strikes on the boat featured in the Trump Truth Social post.
	- `The longer the U.S. surveillance aircraft followed the boat, the more confident intelligence analysts watching from command centers became that the 11 people on board were ferrying drugs.`
	  
	  `Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth gave a spoken directive, according to two people with direct knowledge of the operation. “The order was to kill everybody,” one of them said.`
	  
	  `A missile screamed off the Trinidad coast, striking the vessel and igniting a blaze from bow to stern. For minutes, commanders watched the boat burning on a live drone feed. As the smoke cleared, they got a jolt: Two survivors were clinging to the smoldering wreck.`
	  
	  `The Special Operations commander overseeing the Sept. 2 attack — the opening salvo in the Trump administration’s war on suspected drug traffickers in the Western Hemisphere — ordered a second strike to comply with Hegseth’s instructions, two people familiar with the matter said. The two men were blown apart in the water.`
	  
	  `Hegseth’s order, which has not been previously reported, adds another dimension to the campaign against suspected drug traffickers. Some current and former U.S. officials and law-of-war experts have said that the Pentagon’s lethal campaign — which has killed more than 80 people to date — is unlawful and may expose those most directly involved to future prosecution.` - [Hegseth order on first Caribbean boat strike, officials say: Kill them all, Washington Post, 2025](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/11/28/hegseth-kill-them-all-survivors-boat-strike)
	- `In briefing materials provided to the White House, JSOC reported that the “double-tap,” or follow-on strike, was intended to sink the boat and remove a navigation hazard to other vessels — not to kill survivors, according to another person who saw the report.`
	  
	  `A similar explanation was given to lawmakers in two closed-door briefings, according to two congressional aides. That explanation has prompted frustration among some members of Congress who say they believe the Pentagon was deceptive in its description of events, the aides said.`
	  
	  `“The idea that wreckage from one small boat in a vast ocean is a hazard to marine traffic is patently absurd, and killing survivors is blatantly illegal,” said Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Massachusetts), a Marine Corps veteran and vocal Trump critic who received a classified briefing from Pentagon officials on the strikes in late October with other members of the House Armed Services Committee. “Mark my words: It may take some time, but Americans will be prosecuted for this, either as a war crime or outright murder.”`
	  
	  `The boat in the first strike was hit a total of four times, twice to kill the crew and twice more to sink it, four people familiar with the operation said.`
	  
	  `In subsequent strikes on alleged traffickers that left no survivors, the U.S. military has also fired multiple missiles to remove boats from the waterways, several people familiar with the matter said.` - [Hegseth order on first Caribbean boat strike, officials say: Kill them all, Washington Post, 2025](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/11/28/hegseth-kill-them-all-survivors-boat-strike)
- On 28 November 2025, Hegseth tweeted that the Washington Post story was fake news and that the strikes were lawful under U.S. and International Law.
	- `As usual, the fake news is delivering more fabricated, inflammatory, and derogatory reporting to discredit our incredible warriors fighting to protect the homeland.`
	  
	  `As we’ve said from the beginning, and in every statement, these highly effective strikes are specifically intended to be “lethal, kinetic strikes.” The declared intent is to stop lethal drugs, destroy narco-boats, and kill the narco-terrorists who are poisoning the American people. Every trafficker we kill is affiliated with a Designated Terrorist Organization.`
	  
	  `The Biden administration preferred the kid gloves approach, allowing millions of people — including dangerous cartels and unvetted Afghans — to flood our communities with drugs and violence. The Trump administration has sealed the border and gone on offense against narco-terrorists. Biden coddled terrorists, we kill them.`
	  
	  `Our current operations in the Caribbean are lawful under both U.S. and international law, with all actions in compliance with the law of armed conflict—and approved by the best military and civilian lawyers, up and down the chain of command.`

- On 1 December 2025, Hegseth tweeted that he did not give the order for the second strike.
	- `Let’s make one thing crystal clear:`
	  
	  `Admiral Mitch Bradley is an American hero, a true professional, and has my 100% support. I stand by him and the combat decisions he has made — on the September 2 mission and all others since.`
	  
	  `America is fortunate to have such men protecting us. When this @DeptofWar says we have the back of our warriors — we mean it.` - [@PeteHegseth Tweet, Twitter (X), 2025](https://x.com/PeteHegseth/status/1995643490152128919)
- On 2 December 2025, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that there was a second strike and that the Head of the Joint Special Operations Command, Admiral Frank Bradley worked within his authority.
	- `The White House confirmed Monday that the U.S. did launch a second strike on an alleged drug boat from Venezuela in early September and that it was ordered by Adm. Frank M. Bradley, who at the time headed the Joint Special Operations Command.`
	  
	  `The follow-up strike killed the survivors of an initial U.S. strike on the vessel, which the Trump administration has said originated from Venezuela. Some lawmakers and legal experts say that second attack could constitute a war crime.`
	  
	  `“With respect to the strikes in question on Sept. 2, Secretary Hegseth authorized Adm. Bradley to conduct these kinetic strikes,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement during Monday's briefing.`
	  
	  `“Adm. Bradley worked well within his authority and the law directing the engagement to ensure the boat was destroyed and the threat to the United States of America was eliminated," she added.`
	  
	  `U.S. Special Operations Command, which Bradley now leads as commander, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.` - [White House confirms second Sept. 2 strike on alleged drug boat, NBC News, 2025](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/white-house-confirms-second-sept-2-strike-alleged-drug-boat-rcna246834)
- On 4 December 2025, CNN reported that the boat appeared to have no radio or other communications devices onboard, a claim used by defense officials to justify the second strike, and that the two men who survived the first strike were holding on to the boat for 41 minutes before the second strike hit. It was also reported that there were two missiles per strike, totaling four missiles fired.
	- `The two men killed as they floated holding onto their capsized boat in a secondary strike against a suspected drug vessel in early September did not appear to have radio or other communications devices, the top military official overseeing the strike told lawmakers on Thursday, according to three sources with direct knowledge of his congressional briefings.`
	  
	  `As far back as September, defense officials have been quietly pushing back on criticism that killing the two survivors amounted to a war crime by arguing, in part, that they were legitimate targets because they appeared to be radioing for help or backup — reinforcements that, if they had received it, could have theoretically allowed them to continue to traffic the drugs aboard their sinking ship.`
	  
	  `Defense officials made that claim in at least one briefing in September for congressional staff, according to a source familiar with the session, and several media outlets cited officials repeating that justification in the last week.`
	  
	  `But Thursday, Adm. Frank “Mitch” Bradley acknowledged that the two survivors of the military’s initial strike were in no position to make a distress call in his briefings to lawmakers. Bradley was in charge of Joint Special Operations Command at the time of the strike and was the top military officer directing the attack.`
	  
	  `The initial hit on the vessel, believed to be carrying cocaine, killed nine people immediately and split the boat in half, capsizing it and sending a massive smoke plume into the sky, the sources who viewed the video as part of the briefings said. Part of the surveillance video was a zoomed-in, higher-definition view of the two survivors clinging to a still-floating, capsized portion, they said.`
	  
	  `For a little under an hour — 41 minutes, according to a separate US official — Bradley and the rest of the US military command center discussed what to do as they watched the men struggle to overturn what was left of their boat, the sources said.`
	  
	  `During that time, Bradley also consulted with the uniformed lawyer on duty during the operation, he told lawmakers, according to two of the sources. The JAG officer, or judge advocate general officer, assessed it would be legal to move forward with a second strike, the sources added.`
	  
	  `Ultimately, Bradley told lawmakers, he ordered a second strike to destroy the remains of the vessel, killing the two survivors, on the grounds that it appeared that part of the vessel remained afloat because it still held cocaine, according to one of the sources. The survivors could hypothetically have floated to safety, been rescued, and carried on with trafficking the drugs, the logic went.`
	  
	  `The other source with direct knowledge of the briefing called that rationale “f**king insane.”`
	  
	  `The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.`
	  
	  `According to Senate Intelligence Chairman Tom Cotton, a Republican of Arkansas, and Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, who were also briefed, the military used a total of four missiles to sink the boat: two missiles in the initial strike, according to Coons, and two in the second strike.` - [Exclusive: Survivors clinging to capsized boat didn’t radio for backup, admiral overseeing double-tap strike tells lawmakers,  CNN, 2025](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/12/04/politics/strike-lawmakers-briefing-radio-survivors)

# Investigations
- On 29 November 2025, both the Senate Armed Services Committee and the House Armed Services Committee have announced their intention to investigate the strike in a rare display of bipartisan alignment.
	- `House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mike Rogers (R-Ala.) and Ranking Member Adam Smith (D-Wash.) issued the following joint statement.`
	  
	  `"This committee is committed to providing rigorous oversight of the Department of Defense’s military operations in the Caribbean. We take seriously the reports of follow-on strikes on boats alleged to be ferrying narcotics in the SOUTHCOM region and are taking bipartisan action to gather a full accounting of the operation in question.”` - [Rogers and Smith Issue Joint Statement on Recent Reports of Follow-Up Strike Ordered in SOUTHCOM AOR, House Armed Services Committee, 2025](https://democrats-armedservices.house.gov/2025/11/rogers-and-smith-issue-joint-statement-on-recent-reports-of-follow-up-strike-ordered-in-southcom-aor#:~:text=We%20take%20seriously%20the%20reports,of%20the%20operation%20in%20question.%E2%80%9D)
