# Perkins Coie Executive Order
## Background
- Perkins Coie are a law firm that, in relation to the [Mueller’s Special Counsel Investigation](../2017-21%20Donald%20Trump/2016-19%20Mueller’s%20Special%20Counsel%20Investigation), were retaining Fusion GPS' services that entailed Christopher Steele to make the Steele Dossier for the Hillary Clinton Presidential Campaign, as well as representing Democrats in various legal cases including all the [2020 Election Fraud](../2017-21%20Donald%20Trump/2020%20Election%20Fraud%20Conspiracy,%202nd%20Impeachment) cases against Trump. Michael Sussmann, a former lawyer who worked for Perkins Coie was indited in the course of the [Durham’s Special Counsel Investigation](../2017-21%20Donald%20Trump/2019-23%20Durham’s%20Special%20Counsel%20Investigation) for making false statements to the FBI in 2016, but was acquitted by a jury of those charges.
## Main Point
- On 6 March 2025, Trump signed an executive order targeting Perkins Coie LLP and their security clearances, ordered a review of all Perkins Coie LLP, 
	- `The dishonest and dangerous activity of the law firm Perkins Coie LLP (“Perkins Coie”) has affected this country for decades. Notably, in 2016 while representing failed Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, Perkins Coie hired Fusion GPS, which then manufactured a false “dossier” designed to steal an election. This egregious activity is part of a pattern. Perkins Coie has worked with activist donors including George Soros to judicially overturn popular, necessary, and democratically enacted election laws, including those requiring voter identification. In one such case, a court was forced to sanction Perkins Coie attorneys for an unethical lack of candor before the court.`
	  
	  `In addition to undermining democratic elections, the integrity of our courts, and honest law enforcement, Perkins Coie racially discriminates against its own attorneys and staff, and against applicants. Perkins Coie publicly announced percentage quotas in 2019 for hiring and promotion on the basis of race and other categories prohibited by civil rights laws. It proudly excluded applicants on the basis of race for its fellowships, and it maintained these discriminatory practices until applicants harmed by them finally sued to enforce change.`
	  
	  `My Administration is committed to ending discrimination under “diversity, equity, and inclusion” policies and ensuring that Federal benefits support the laws and policies of the United States, including those laws and policies promoting our national security and respecting the democratic process. Those who engage in blatant race-based and sex-based discrimination, including quotas, but purposefully hide the nature of such discrimination through deceiving language, have engaged in a serious violation of the public trust. Their disrespect for the bedrock principle of equality represents good cause to conclude that they neither have access to our Nation’s secrets nor be deemed responsible stewards of any Federal funds.` - [Addressing Risks from Perkins Coie LLP, The White House, 2025](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-risks-from-perkins-coie-llp/)

## Lawsuit
- On 11 March 2025, Perkins Coie filed a lawsuit arguing that Trump exercised unconstitutional judicial authority, unconstitutionally deprived them of procedural due process, unconstitutionally denied of equal protection and unconstitutionally denied of first amendment free speech and associational rights.
	- `This case concerns an Executive Order issued on March 6, 2025, entitled, “Addressing Risks From Perkins Coie LLP” (“the Order”). The Order is an affront to the Constitution and our adversarial system of justice. Its plain purpose is to bully those who advocate points of view that the President perceives as adverse to the views of his Administration, whether those views are presented on behalf of paying or pro bono clients. Perkins Coie brings this case reluctantly. The firm is comprised of lawyers who advocate for clients; its attorneys and employees are not activists or partisans. But Perkins Coie’s ability to represent the interests of its clients—and its ability to operate as a legal-services business at all—are under direct and imminent threat. Perkins Coie cannot allow its clients to be bullied. The firm is committed to a resolute defense of the rule of law, without regard to party or ideology, and therefore brings this lawsuit to declare the Order unlawful and to enjoin its implementation.` - [Perkins Coie LLP V. U.S. Department of Justice (Civil Complaint), United States District Court for the District of Columbia, 2025](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.278290/gov.uscourts.dcd.278290.1.0_3.pdf)
	- `The Order imposes these punishments ex post facto—the President having already supposedly adjudicated the matters—determining that Perkins Coie engaged in “dishonest and dangerous activity,” “manufactured” evidence in connection with the Clinton 2016 presidential campaign, engaged in “a pattern” of “egregious activity” by challenging (and defending) election laws, and “racially discriminated against” its employees and applicants, all without giving notice to Perkins Coie and without giving Perkins Coie an opportunity to be heard and contest these and other false and disparaging claims made in the Order.`
	  
	  `The Order imposes these punishments as retaliation for the firm’s association with, and representation of, clients that the President perceives as his political opponents. Many law firms represented candidates, parties, and related political committees and organizations in the 2016 and 2020 campaigns. But the Order targets only one firm—Perkins Coie—because the President views it, more than any other firm, as aligned with the Democratic Party by reason of its representation of the 2016 Clinton presidential campaign and its successful handling of challenges brought by the Trump campaign seeking to overturn the results of the 2020 election, as well as victories the firm won for its clients in a significant number of voting rights cases, including cases where Perkins Coie succeeded in upholding existing laws, in connection with the 2020 election.` - [Perkins Coie LLP V.

	- `WHEREFORE, Perkins Coie respectfully requests that the Court:`
	  
	  `Declare the Executive Order unconstitutional as violative of the Separation of Powers and Article II of and the First, Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the Constitution.`
	  
	  `Immediately enjoin implementation of the Order pending consideration of a motion for preliminary injunction.`
	  
	  `Preliminarily, then permanently, enjoin implementation of the Order.`
	  
	  `Grant such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.` - [Perkins Coie LLP V. U.S. Department of Justice (Civil Complaint), United States District Court for the District of Columbia, 2025](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.278290/gov.uscourts.dcd.278290.1.0_3.pdf)
- On 12 March 2025, Judge Beryl Howell granted Perkins Coie a Temporary Restraining Order, in which stopped the execution of parts 1, 3, and 5 of the executive order.
