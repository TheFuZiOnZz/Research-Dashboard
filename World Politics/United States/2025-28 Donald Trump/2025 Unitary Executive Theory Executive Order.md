# Background
- Unitary Executive Theory is a Constitutional law theory according to which the President of the United States has sole authority over the executive branch.
# Main Info
- On 18 February 2025, Trump signed an Executive Order which claimed that the Executive Office has been given ultimate authority, to execute all U.S. law. The order also expanded control of various independent regulatory agencies.
	- `The Constitution vests all executive power in the President and charges him with faithfully executing the laws. Since it would be impossible for the President to single-handedly perform all the executive business of the Federal Government, the Constitution also provides for subordinate officers to assist the President in his executive duties. In the exercise of their often-considerable authority, these executive branch officials remain subject to the President’s ongoing supervision and control. The President in turn is regularly elected by and accountable to the American people. This is one of the structural safeguards, along with the separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches, regular elections for the Congress, and an independent judiciary whose judges are appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, by which the Framers created a Government accountable to the American people.`
	  
	  `However, previous administrations have allowed so-called “independent regulatory agencies” to operate with minimal Presidential supervision.  These regulatory agencies currently exercise substantial executive authority without sufficient accountability to the President, and through him, to the American people. Moreover, these regulatory agencies have been permitted to promulgate significant regulations without review by the President.`
	  
	  `These practices undermine such regulatory agencies’ accountability to the American people and prevent a unified and coherent execution of Federal law. For the Federal Government to be truly accountable to the American people, officials who wield vast executive power must be supervised and controlled by the people’s elected President.`
	  
	  `Therefore, in order to improve the administration of the executive branch and to increase regulatory officials’ accountability to the American people, it shall be the policy of the executive branch to ensure Presidential supervision and control of the entire executive branch. Moreover, all executive departments and agencies, including so-called independent agencies, shall submit for review all proposed and final significant regulatory actions to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) within the Executive Office of the President before publication in the Federal Register.` - [Ensuring Accountability for All Agencies, The White House, 2025](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/ensuring-accountability-for-all-agencies/)
# Lawsuit
- On 28 February 2025, the the Democratic National Committee (DNC), Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) filed a lawsuit against Trump’s Executive Order claiming it would remove a requirement of the Federal Election Campaign Act to keep the decisions made independent.
	- `As applied to the Commission, Executive Order 14215 would eliminate [the Federal Election Campaign Act’s] requirement that the executive branch’s legal interpretations of FECA’s provisions reflect the bipartisan consensus of an expert multimember board and replace that bipartisan consensus with the judgment of a single partisan political figure — the President of the United States.` - [Democratic National Committee V. Donald J. Trump (Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief), United States District Court for the District of Columbia, 2025](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/elg-compl-for-decl-and-inj-relief-02-28-2025.pdf)
	- `Executive Order 14215 grounds its unprecedented assertion of presidential power in Article II of the U.S. Constitution. But the constitutionality of FECA’s vesting of authority in the FEC is beyond question. The FEC is “patterned on the classic independent regulatory agency.” FEC v. NRA Political Victory Fund, 6 F.3d 821, 826 (D.C. Cir. 1993). As the Supreme Court has held for 90 years, it “cannot well be doubted” that Congress possesses the authority to insulate from presidential micromanagement agencies that are led by a multimember, bipartisan board that performs quasi-judicial and quasi-legislative functions—that is, agencies like the FEC. Humphrey’s Ex’r v. United States, 295 U.S. 602, 629 (1935). Congress’s authority is especially true in this context, where the credibility of the entire regulatory enterprise would be fatally undermined if the party controlling the White House can unilaterally structure campaign rules and adjudicate disputes to disadvantage its electoral competitors.` - [Democratic National Committee V. Donald J. Trump (Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief), United States District Court for the District of Columbia, 2025](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/elg-compl-for-decl-and-inj-relief-02-28-2025.pdf)
	- `The Court should therefore certify the question of FECA’s constitutionality to the en banc D.C. Circuit under 52 U.S.C. § 30110, and then declare that FECA’s provisions shielding FEC decision-making from presidential coercion or control are constitutionally valid and enjoin the application of Section 7 of Executive Order 14215 to the Commission as inconsistent with those provisions.` - [Democratic National Committee V. Donald J. Trump (Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief), United States District Court for the District of Columbia, 2025](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/elg-compl-for-decl-and-inj-relief-02-28-2025.pdf)
	- `The assertion is incompatible with nearly a century’s worth of Supreme Court precedent blessing Congress’s authority to insulate certain agencies and officials from day-to-day control by the President. See, e.g., Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654, 692–93 (1988); Weiner v. United States, 357 U.S. 349, 356 (1958); Humphrey’s Ex’r, 295 U.S. at 629; see also Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 141 (1976) (recognizing the FEC’s functions “are of kinds usually performed by independent regulatory agencies” and that “Congress viewed [the FEC’s] broad powers as essential to effective and impartial administration of the entire substantive framework of [FECA]”)` - [Democratic National Committee V. Donald J. Trump (Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief), United States District Court for the District of Columbia, 2025](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/elg-compl-for-decl-and-inj-relief-02-28-2025.pdf)
