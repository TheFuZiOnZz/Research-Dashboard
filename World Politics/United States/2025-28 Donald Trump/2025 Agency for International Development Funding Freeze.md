- Trump signed an [Executive Order on January 20th, 2025](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/reevaluating-and-realigning-united-states-foreign-aid/) ordering a 90-day freeze to be put into effect on all foreign development assistance programs for evaluation to ensure that they are aligned with Trump's foreign policy. The EO cites the [apportionment authority](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/a11_current_year/s120.pdf) of the OMB in order to carry out this funding freeze. It's unclear (to me) if this is a legitimate and legal use of the apportionment authority. (According to a _Just Security_ [article](https://www.justsecurity.org/107267/can-president-dissolve-usaid-by-executive-order/), it's probably not legal)

        - **Update 1:** On Feb. 11, Plaintiffs [moved](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.277336/gov.uscourts.dcd.277336.4.0_1.pdf) for a TRO enjoining implementation of the Executive Order and State Department Memorandum.
        - **Update 2:** On Feb. 13, the court [granted](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.277336/gov.uscourts.dcd.277336.21.0_4.pdf) a TRO in this case and _AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition v. United States Department of State_ on narrower terms than originally requested. The order enjoins implementation on the blanket suspension of foreign aid funding, but does not enjoin enforcement or implementation of Executive Order 14169, individual personnel decisions, or termination of individual contracts.
        - **Update 3:** On Feb. 20, the court [granted](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.277333/gov.uscourts.dcd.277333.30.0.pdf) in part plaintiffs’ motion for enforcement of the court’s TRO “to the extent Defendants have not complied with the terms of the TRO,” but did not make a finding of contempt, citing “Defendants’ explicit recognition that ‘prompt compliance with the order’ is required.” The granted motion applies to this case and AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition v. United States Department of State.
