        - **Update 1:** On Feb. 11, Plaintiffs [moved](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.277336/gov.uscourts.dcd.277336.4.0_1.pdf) for a TRO enjoining implementation of the Executive Order and State Department Memorandum.

United States Department of State_ on narrower terms than originally requested.

United States Department of State.
