- On 20 November 2025, following multiple reposting of similar messages from Trump supporters on his Truth Social feed, Trump posted that the Democrats featured in the video should be charged with Seditious Conspiracy stating that it is punishable by death.  
	- `SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!` - [@realDonaldTrump Post, Truth Social, 2025](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115582703277798715)
- On 20 November 2025, following the Truth Social post, Trump claimed that the post was not threatening death.
	- `Following his social media posts, Trump told Fox News in a radio interview on Friday: "I'm not threatening death, but I think they're in serious trouble."`
	  
	  `"If you look at sedition", Trump continued, "that's a form of, a very strong form of being a traitor. It's a terrible thing to say, I must tell you."`
	  
	  `Trump also suggested the US defence secretary and US deputy attorney general were looking into the matter.` - [Trump says he was 'not threatening death' to Democrats over video to troops, BBC News, 2025](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx2p2dz9zk2o)
- On 25 November 2025, the six Democratic Lawmakers became subject to a FBI probe.
	- `A group of Democratic lawmakers who encouraged US troops to disobey any orders they deem illegal are pushing back on an alleged federal inquiry into their actions.`
	  
	  `US Senator Elissa Slotkin, of Michigan, said the FBI had notified the six lawmakers of its investigation on Monday, after she and others appeared in a video last week, which US President Donald Trump branded "seditious".`
	  
	  `"No amount of intimidation or harassment will ever stop us from doing our jobs and honouring our Constitution," four Democrats in the US House of Representatives said.`
	  
	  `The Department of Justice (DoJ) and FBI have declined to comment on the reported investigation.`
	  
	  `The Pentagon has also previously announced that it will review "serious allegations of misconduct" against Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, who appeared in the clip.`
	  
	  `On Tuesday, Reuters reported that a DoJ official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the FBI had requested interviews with six Democratic politicians to determine "if there's any wrongdoing, and then go from there".`
	  
	  `When Kelly was asked by NPR about the matter later that day, he said: "The sergeant at arms got something in an email. We're taking a look at it."` - 
# Investigations
- On 24 November 2025, The Pentagon said it is reviewing "serious allegations of misconduct" against US Democratic Senator Mark Kelly.
	- `The Department of War has received serious allegations of misconduct against Captain Mark Kelly, USN (Ret.). In accordance with the Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C. § 688, and other applicable regulations, a thorough review of these allegations has been initiated to determine further actions, which may include recall to active duty for court-martial proceedings or administrative measures. This matter will be handled in compliance with military law, ensuring due process and impartiality. Further official comments will be limited, to preserve the integrity of the proceedings.`
	  
	  `The Department of War reminds all individuals that military retirees remain subject to the UCMJ for applicable offenses, and federal laws such as 18 U.S.C. § 2387 prohibit actions intended to interfere with the loyalty, morale, or good order and discipline of the armed forces. Any violations will be addressed through appropriate legal channels.`
	  
	  `All servicemembers are reminded that they have a legal obligation under the UCMJ to obey lawful orders and that orders are presumed to be lawful. A servicemember’s personal philosophy does not justify or excuse the disobedience of an otherwise lawful order.` - [@DeptofWar Tweet, Twitter, 2025](https://x.com/DeptofWar/status/1992999267967905905)
- On 24 November 2025, Kelly responded to the news of the Pentagon's investigation saying he and other members of congress wouldn't be intimidated and will protect the constitution.
	- `When I was 22 years old, I commissioned as an Ensign in the United States Navy and swore an oath to the Constitution. I upheld that oath through flight school, multiple deployments on the USS Midway, 39 combat missions in Operation Desert Storm, test pilot school, four space shuttle flights at NASA, and every day since I retired – which I did after my wife Gabby was shot in the head while serving her constituents.`
	  
	  `In combat, I had a missile blow up next to my jet and flew through anti-aircraft fire to drop bombs on enemy targets. At NASA, I launched on a rocket, commanded the space shuttle, and was part of the recovery mission that brought home the bodies of my astronaut classmates who died on Columbia. I did all of this in service to this country that I love and has given me so much.`
	  
	  `Secretary Hegseth’s tweet is the first I heard of this. I also saw the President’s posts saying I should be arrested, hanged, and put to death.`
	  
	  `If this is meant to intimidate me and other members of Congress from doing our jobs and holding this administration accountable, it won’t work. I’ve given too much to this country to be silenced by bullies who care more about their own power than protecting the Constitution.` - [@SenMarkKelly Tweet, Twitter, 2025](https://x.com/SenMarkKelly/status/1993025671757807746)
