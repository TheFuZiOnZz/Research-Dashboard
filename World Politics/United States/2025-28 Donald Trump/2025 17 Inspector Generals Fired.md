# Background
- On 13 February 2025, The New York Times reported that Phyllis Fong, the fired inspector for the Department of Agriculture, was conducting an investigation into Elon Musk’s brain implant startup, Neuralink.
	- `In his first week, Mr. Trump fired at least 17 inspectors general, who are charged with investigating waste and corruption within their own agencies.`
	  
	  `The mass firing — a move that may have violated federal law — may benefit Mr. Musk.`
	  
	  `Among the dismissed inspectors general was Phyllis Fong at the Agriculture Department.`
	  
	  `Her agency had opened an investigation in 2022 into Mr. Musk’s brain implant start-up, Neuralink, and the inquiry was in progress as of late last year, according to two people familiar with it. Reuters reported last month that the investigation was continuing.`
	  
	  `In December, Mr. Musk posted a letter from his lawyer on X that claimed that the S.E.C. had also reopened an investigation into Neuralink.`
	  
	  `Both investigations arose after a nonprofit, Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, discovered through a public records lawsuit in 2021 that Neuralink had allegedly mistreated dozens of test monkeys, Ryan Merkley, the nonprofit’s director of research advocacy, said in an interview.`
	  
	  `“They suffered from infections, internal bleeding and there were surgical mistakes that were made where devices that were screwed to the skull came loose,” Mr. Merkley said.`
	  
	  `Mr. Musk has denied the mistreatment of monkeys at Neuralink, and the company was not cited after a U.S.D.A. review.` - [Elon Musk’s Business Empire Scores Benefits Under Trump Shake-Up, The New York Times, 2025](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/us/politics/elon-musk-companies-conflicts.html/)
# Main Info
- On 25 January 2025, Trump fired 17 different Inspector Generals from a broad swath of the federal departments, including the Department of Defense, State Department, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Energy, and Department of Transportation. allowing him free to appoint their replacements. Trump said `I did it because it’s a very common thing to do`. The cited reason for the firings were `changing priorities` in a two sentence email.
	- `President Donald Trump fired the inspectors general from more than a dozen federal agencies in a Friday night purge, according to a Trump administration official, paving the way for him to install his own picks for the independent watchdog roles.`
	  
	  `Agency inspectors general received an email late Friday from Sergio Gor, the head of the White House Office of Presidential Personnel, informing them that “changing priorities” had led to their positions being “terminated” effective immediately, according to a person familiar with the matter. The shake-up affected a broad swath of the federal government, including the departments of State, Energy, the Interior, Defense and Transportation.`
	  
	  `During Trump’s first term, he gutted his administration of independent government watchdogs he saw as disloyal. An IG conducts investigations and audits into any potential malfeasance, fraud, waste or abuse by a government agency or its personnel, and issues reports and recommendations on its findings. An inspector general’s office is intended to operate independently.`
	  
	  `Partly in reaction to Trump’s last IG firings, Congress built new guardrails intended to protect them. A 2022 law requires the White House to provide substantive rationale for terminating any inspector general.`
	  
	  `The firings have prompted concern from some GOP senators, including Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley of Iowa, a known “watchdog” for IGs, who said Congress wasn’t given the 30 days’ notice from the White House required by federal law.`
	  
	  `Trump said Saturday night that “I did it because it’s a very common thing to do,” telling reporters aboard Air Force One that “not all of them” were removed. He added, without providing evidence, “I don’t know them, but some people thought that some were unfair or were not doing the job. It’s a very standard thing to do.”` - [Trump fires inspectors general from more than a dozen federal agencies, CNN Politics, 2025](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/25/politics/trump-fires-inspectors-general/index.html)

	  `“On behalf of President Donald J. Trump, I am writing to inform you that due to changing priorities your position as Inspector General… is terminated, effective immediately. Thank you for your service," the email read.`
	  
	  `The email addressed the inspector general by her first name -- "Dear Christi" -- with no customary courtesy title, such as "the Honorable," or even "Ms."` - [Trump administration cites 'changing priorities' in emails that fired inspectors general, ABC News, 2025](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-administration-cites-changing-priorities-emails-fired-inspectors/story?id=118123086)
