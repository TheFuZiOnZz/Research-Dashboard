# Main Point
- On 8 March 2025, Mahmoud Khalil, a student activist and negotiator in the 2024 Columbia University pro-Palestinian campus occupations, was taken from his apartment building by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. The federal immigration agents were acting on orders from the State Department to revoke Khalil's student visa. When the agents were informed that Khalil, of Palestinian descent, Syrian nationality, and Algerian citizenship, is a lawful permanent resident of the United States in possession of a green card, they said this status would be revoked instead.
	- `A Columbia University student who helped lead last year’s pro-Palestinian demonstrations has been arrested by federal immigration authorities.`
	  
	  `Mahmoud Khalil was detained Saturday night by Department of Homeland Security agents, according to his lawyer Amy Greer. The agents said they were acting on orders from the State Department to revoke his green card, Greer said.`
	  
	  `Multiple immigration agents took Khalil into custody around 8:30 p.m. after entering his building, which is owned by Columbia University, according to his lawyer.`
	  
	  `Khalil, who is Palestinian and Syrian, was able to call Greer from the lobby, she said, and one of the agents got on the phone to speak to her. When the agent told her the State Department had revoked his student visa, Greer said she informed the agent that Khalil is a lawful permanent resident.`
	  
	  `“And the agent said they revoked that too,” said Greer. The agent hung up when she said she needed to see a warrant before Khalil could be detained, according to Greer. Khalil finished his studies in December and plans to walk in the school’s coming graduation ceremony, she said. During the protests he took on the role of negotiator between his group and administrators, his lawyer said.` - [ICE Arrests Columbia Student Who Helped Lead Pro-Palestinian Protests, The Wall Street Journal, 2025](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/dhs-detains-columbia-student-who-helped-lead-pro-palestinian-protests-fbbd8196?mod=Searchresults_pos1)
