# Background
- On 13 February 2025, The New York Times reported that the National Labor Relations Board was suing Musk's X/Twitter for its large job cuts 
	- `On its own, the National Labor Relations Board, an independent watchdog agency for workers’ rights, has 24 investigations into Mr. Musk’s companies, according to the review by The Times.` - [Elon Musk’s Business Empire Scores Benefits Under Trump Shake-Up, The New York Times, 2025](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/us/politics/elon-musk-companies-conflicts.html/)
	- `At two federal watchdog agencies for workers, the actions by Mr. Trump have a clear effect on Mr. Musk’s business empire, as well as countless other companies that have matters before them.`
	  
	  `The firings at the agencies, the National Labor Relations Board and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, mean neither has a quorum on its board to decide cases.`
	  
	  `One of the many N.L.R.B. investigations involves Mr. Musk’s companies’ sweeping job cuts in 2022 at his social media platform X, then called Twitter.`
	  
	  `Twitter employees at the time banded together to talk about what was going on at work, on Slack software and on the messaging app Signal. Twitter tried to get ahold of the communications and even surveilled some employees, according to copies of the N.L.R.B. charges obtained through public records requests.`
	  
	  `The matter is being reviewed by N.L.R.B. staff, but the board’s current construct could trouble its path forward or prevent a decision against X from being enforced.`
	  
	  `Even if Mr. Trump replaces the absent board member, that would be likely to significantly shift the balance of the board more Republican, according to four people familiar with the agency.`
	  
	  `Shannon Liss-Riordan, a lawyer representing the Twitter workers, said she is worried that the changes at the N.L.R.B. could affect those specific charges.`
	  
	  `“If I were a betting person, this is not exactly where I’m hanging my hat today,” she said.`
	  
	  `In 2023, the E.E.O.C. separately sued Tesla, alleging widespread and “ongoing racial harassment of its Black employees” and retaliation.`
	  
	  `The litigation has been a thorn in Tesla’s side. Last year, a judge ruled against the company’s move to dismiss the lawsuit despite the company’s argument that “Black workers can and do thrive at Tesla.”` - [Elon Musk’s Business Empire Scores Benefits Under Trump Shake-Up, The New York Times, 2025](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/us/politics/elon-musk-companies-conflicts.html/)
# Main Info
- On 25 January 2025
	- `Donald Trump has fired a senior official at the top US labor watchdog, triggering a chorus of criticism from unions and in effect paralyzing the body until a replacement is confirmed.`
	  
	  `Gwynne Wilcox, a member and former chair of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), described her dismissal as “unprecedented and illegal” and pledged to challenge the move.`
	  
	  `Her removal leaves the board with only two members, and leaves it without a quorum of three members required to issue decisions, per a 2010 supreme court ruling.`
	  
	  `Wilcox was confirmed by the Senate, and her term was due to continue until August 2028. She had been appointed chair of the NLRB by Biden last month, before Trump appointed Marvin Kaplan, a Republican-appointed member, as chair last week.` -
