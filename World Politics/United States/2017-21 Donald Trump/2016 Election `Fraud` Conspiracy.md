### 2016 Election `Fraud` Conspiracy
- Trump has claimed without evidence that between 3 and 5 million people cost him the popular vote to Hillary Clinton by voting illegally. He argued that he narrowly lost to Hillary Clinton in 2016 in New Hampshire because thousands of people were illegally bused there from Massachusetts.

- On May 11, 2017, Trump signed an executive order to establish a voter fraud commission to conduct an investigation into voter fraud. [link](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/11/trump-voter-fraud-commission-238263)
- On January 3, 2018, the Trump administration disbanded the commission. In the disbanding announcement, Trump blamed states for not handing over requested voter information to the commission, and still maintained that there was `substantial evidence of voter fraud`.

- `In a letter to Vice President Mike Pence and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who are both Republicans and led the commission, Maine Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap said the documents show there was a “pre-ordained outcome” and that drafts of a commission report included a section on evidence of voter fraud that was “glaringly empty.”` [link](https://apnews.com/f5f6a73b2af546ee97816bb35e82c18d/Report:-Trump-commission-did-not-find-widespread-voter-fraud)
- Election integrity experts argued that the commission was disbanded because of the lawsuits, which would have led to greater transparency and accountability in the commission and thus prevented the Republican members of the commission from producing a sham report to justify restrictions on voting rights, [link](http://www.pressherald.com/2018/01/06/trump-administration-resists-turning-over-documents-to-dunlap/)
- The often cited 2012 Pew report, which Trump has incorrectly cited as proof of voter fraud, entitled `Inaccurate, Costly, and Inefficient Evidence That America's Voter Registration System Needs an Upgrade,` was based on data collected in 2008. The study investigated `outdated voter rolls, not fraudulent votes.` It did not make `mention of non-citizens voting or registering to vote`.

- Proponents of voter ID laws have pointed to a 2014 study by Old Dominion University professors Jesse Richman and David Earnest as justification. The study, which used data developed by the Cooperative Congressional Election Study, concluded that more than 14 percent of self-identified non-citizens in 2008 and 2010 indicated that they were registered to vote, approximately 6.4% of surveyed non-citizens voted in 2008, and 2.2% of surveyed non-citizens voted in 2010.

- However, the study also concluded that voter ID requirements would be ineffective at reducing non-citizen voting. [[lafim]] This study has been criticized by numerous academics.

- One of those was a 2015 study by the managers of the Cooperative Congressional Election Study found that the Richman and Earnest study was `almost certainly flawed` and that, in fact, it was most likely that 0% of non-citizens had voted in recent American elections. Richman and Earnest's findings were the result of measurement error; some individuals who answered the survey checked the wrong boxes in surveys. Richman and Earnest therefore extrapolated from a handful of wrongfully classified cases to achieve an exaggerated number of individuals who appeared to be non-citizen voters.

- Richman later conceded that `the response error issues ... may have biased our numbers`. Richman has also rebuked Trump for claiming that millions voted illegally in 2016. [[illegal]]
- Brian Schaffner, Professor of Political Science at University of Massachusetts, Amherst, who was part of the team that debunked Richman and Earnest's study said that the study `... is not only wrong, it is irresponsible social science and should never have been published in the first place. There is no evidence that non-citizens have voted in recent U.S. elections ... It is bad research, because it fails to understand basic facts about the data it uses. Indeed, it took me and my colleagues only a few hours to figure out why the authors' findings were wrong and to produce the evidence needed to prove as much. The authors were essentially basing their claims on two pieces of data associated with the large survey—a question that asks people whether they are citizens and official vote records to which each respondent has been matched to determine whether he or she had voted. Both these pieces of information include some small amounts of measurement error, as is true of all survey questions. What the authors failed to consider is that measurement error was entirely responsible for their results. In fact, once my colleagues and I accounted for that error, we found that there were essentially zero non-citizens who voted in recent elections.` [link](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/11/donald-trump-illegal-votes-evidence-debunked-214487)
