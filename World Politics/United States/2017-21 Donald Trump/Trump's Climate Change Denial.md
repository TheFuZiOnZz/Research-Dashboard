### Trump's Climate Change Denial
- Trump in 2016, he was asked `You think climate change is a real thing? Is there human-caused climate change?` and he responded `I think there’s a change in weather. I am not a great believer in man-made climate change.` [link](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2016/03/22/donald-trumps-unsettling-nonsense-on-weather-and-climate/)
- Trump in 2015 made a speech for the paris climate committee before leaving the accord and said `We’re going to deal with real environmental challenges, not the phony ones we’ve been hearing about.`. [[dona]]
- Trump in 2018 was interviewed on `60 Minutes` following both Hurricane Michael and the release of the latest IPCC report and said `I’m not denying climate change. But it could very well go back.` interviewer disagrees and brings up consensus and says `Show me the scientists` [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7vYkX-WVs)
- Trump in 2018 was interviewed by Piers Morgan and was asked about if climate change is real, he said `The ice caps were going to melt. They were going to melt. They were going to be gone by now, but now they’re setting records, so OK, they’re at a record level.` [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYWsTHbDIm8)
- The consensus on the acknowledgement of climate change has been consistent for many years
- In 2001 Following the publication of the IPCC Third Assessment Report, seventeen national science academies issued a joint statement, entitled `The Science of Climate Change`, explicitly acknowledging the IPCC position as representing the scientific consensus on climate change science.

- In 2007 In preparation for the 33rd G8 summit, the Network of African Science Academies submitted a joint `statement on sustainability, energy efficiency, and climate change`: A consensus, based on current evidence, now exists within the global scientific community that human activities are the main source of climate change and that the burning of fossil fuels is largely responsible for driving this change. The IPCC should be congratulated for the contribution it has made to public understanding of the nexus that exists between energy, climate and sustainability.

- In 2009 In advance of the UNFCCC negotiations to be held in Copenhagen in December 2009, the national science academies of the G8+5 nations issued a joint statement declaring, `Climate change and sustainable energy supply are crucial challenges for the future of humanity. It is essential that world leaders agree on the emission reductions needed to combat negative consequences of anthropogenic climate change`. The statement references the IPCC's Fourth Assessment of 2007, and asserts that `climate change is happening even faster than previously estimated; global CO2 emissions since 2000 have been higher than even the highest predictions, Arctic sea ice has been melting at rates much faster than predicted, and the rise in the sea level has become more rapid`. The thirteen signatories were the same national science academies that issued the 2007 and 2008 joint statements. [link](https://www.nationalacademies.org/includes/G8+5energy-climate09.pdf)
