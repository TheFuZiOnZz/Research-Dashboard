### 2020 Trump Withdrawing All U.S. Funding From The W.H.O. During Global Pandemic
- Trump announced on 14 April that he is halting $400 million to $500 million of funding to the World Health Organization while a review is conducted. Trump said, noting that China `contributes roughly $40 million.` that there was an imbalance of funding compared to China. Trump said the review would cover the WHO's `role in severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of coronavirus.` `Had the WHO done its job to get medical experts into China to objectively assess the situation on the ground and to call out China's lack of transparency, the outbreak could have been contained at its source with very little death,` Trump said.
