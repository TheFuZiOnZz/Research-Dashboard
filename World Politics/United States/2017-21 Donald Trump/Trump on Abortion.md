### Trump on Abortion
- Trump is in support of appointing justices who may overturn the ruling in Roe v. Wade. [link](https://edition.cnn.com/2016/11/14/politics/trump-gay-marriage-abortion-supreme-court/) Trump said during the Republican 2016 Primaries, he would change the Republican Party platform's position on abortion to include exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother. [link](https://edition.cnn.com/2016/04/21/politics/donald-trump-republican-platform-abortion/) Trump said at a town-hall-style forum in 2016, that women who seek abortions should be subject to `some form of punishment` if the procedure is banned in the United States.

- On the 27th April 2019, Trump said `The baby is born. The mother meets with the doctor. They take care of the baby. They wrap the baby beautifully. And then the doctor and the mother determine whether or not they will execute the baby.` [link](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/28/us/politics/trump-abortion-fact-check.html)
- Anti-abortion laws do not stop or reduce abortions, [link](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/173586/WHO_RHR_15.04_eng.pdf;jsessionid=29C1CFD0AB9731960132761646E95991?sequence=1) but they do make them dangerous. When carried out with the assistance of a trained health-care provider in sanitary conditions, abortions are one of the safest medical procedures available. But when abortions are restricted or criminalized, people are forced to seek unsafe ways to end pregnancies. Worldwide, [link](https://youthsextion.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/2011facts-iaw.pdf) an estimated five million women are hospitalized each year for treatment of abortion-related complications and about 47,000 women die.

- The US has the highest maternal mortality rate [link](https://www.npr.org/2017/05/12/528098789/u-s-has-the-worst-rate-of-maternal-deaths-in-the-developed-world) of any developed nation, and states with more restrictive abortion laws [[lafihiltzikantiabor]] already have higher rates of both infant and maternal mortality. That’s why these new laws are a recipe for disaster for women’s health. People with low incomes - teenagers, people of colour, migrants and refugees - are hardest hit by abortion restrictions because it is more difficult for them to pay, travel or take time off work.
- African-American women are three or four times more likely to die in pregnancy or childbirth than white women in the US, and this shameful inequality will likely be entrenched by new laws making pregnancy more dangerous.

- Even if we dont agree Abortion should be alowed, Subsidizing Contraception contributes to a reduced number of abortions. Abortion rates have been falling since the 80’s, according to numbers from the CDC. [link](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr63/nvsr63_04.pdf)
- Subsidizing Contraception contributes to a reduced number of teen pregnancies. According to a 2014 National Vital Statistics report teen pregnancy has fallen 57% between 1991 and 2013. An analysis of data from two cycles of NSFG concluded that improved contraceptive use may have been the key factor behind the declines in teen birth rates.

- A study posted in the Quarterly Journal of Economics in 2006 asserts `The results suggest that legal access to the pill before age 21 significantly reduced the likelihood of a first birth before age 22, increased the number of women in the paid labor force, and raised the number of annual hours worked.` Access to the pill before the age of 21 reduced the likelihood of being a mother before age 22 by 14-18%, and increased later employment between the ages of 26-30 by 8%.` [link](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/19c2/ba3f4f380f3ba5dc064b7b6e8e9f095492e2.pdf)
- A study published by Harvard University and National Bureau of Economic Research presents evidence `establishing the `power of the pill` in lowering the costs of long-duration professional education for women and raising the age at first marriage.` [link](https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/2624453)
- A 2009 study, `Cost Savings From the Provision of Specific Methods of Contraception in a Publicly Funded Program,` `examined the cost-effectiveness of contraceptive methods dispensed in 2003 to 955, 000 women in Family PACT (Planning, Access, Care and Treatment), California's publicly funded family planning program...The implant and intrauterine contraceptives were the most cost-effective, with cost savings of more than $7.00 for every $1.00 spent in services and supplies. Per $1.00 spent, injectable contraceptives yielded savings of $5.60; oral contraceptives, $4.07; the patch, $2.99; the vaginal ring, $2.55; barrier methods, $1.34; and emergency contraceptives, $1.43...All contraceptive methods were cost-effective—they saved more in public expenditures for unintended pregnancies than they cost to provide.` [link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2661445/)
- A similar study in 2014 in Colorado found the same, `programs that increase LARC use among young, low-income women may contribute to declines in fertility rates, abortion rates and births among high-risk women.` [link](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1363/46e1714/full)
- Biden Is in support of `Expanding access to contraception and protect the constitutional right to an abortion.` as he recognises `state laws that so blatantly violate the constitutional right to an abortion, such as so-called TRAP laws, parental notification requirements, mandatory waiting periods, and ultrasound requirements.` [link](https://joebiden.com/healthcare/)
- Biden Is in support of `Expanding access to contraception and protect the constitutional right to an abortion. The Affordable Care Act made historic progress by ensuring access to free preventive care, including contraception. The Biden Plan will build on that progress.` [link](https://joebiden.com/healthcare/)
- Biden Is in support of `Reverse the Trump Administration and states’ all-out assault on women’s right to choose. As president, Biden will work to codify Roe v. Wade, and his Justice Department will do everything in its power to stop the rash of state laws that so blatantly violate the constitutional right to an abortion, such as so-called TRAP laws, parental notification requirements, mandatory waiting periods, and ultrasound requirements.` [link](https://joebiden.com/healthcare/)
- Biden Is in support of `Restore federal funding for Planned Parenthood. The Obama-Biden administration fought Republican attacks on funding for Planned Parenthood again and again. As president, Biden will reissue guidance specifying that states cannot refuse Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood and other providers that refer for abortions or provide related information and reverse the Trump Administration’s rule preventing Planned Parenthood and certain other family planning programs from obtaining Title X funds.` [link](https://joebiden.com/healthcare/)
