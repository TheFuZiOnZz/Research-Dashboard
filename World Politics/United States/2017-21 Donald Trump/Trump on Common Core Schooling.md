### Trump on Common Core Schooling
- Trump has blasted the Common Core State Standards Initiative, calling it a `total disaster`. Trump has asserted that Common Core is `education through Washington, D.C.`, a claim which is `false`, since the adoption and implementation of Common Core is a state choice, not a federal one [link](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/mar/10/donald-trump/common-core-education-through-washington-dc-trump-/) [link](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2016/03/04/donald-trump-is-wrong-about-common-core-but-hes-not-the-only-candidate-who-is/)
- Kentucky was the first to implement the Common Core State Standards, and local school districts began offering new math and English curricula based on the standard in August 2010. In 2013, Time magazine reported that the high school graduation rate had increased from 80 percent in 2010 to 86 percent in 2013, test scores went up 2 percentage points in the second year of using the Common Core test, and the percentage of students considered to be ready for college or a career, based on a battery of assessments, went up from 34 percent in 2010 to 54 percent in 2013 [link](http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2152412,00.html)
- The Obama-Biden administration did all it could to change how states approach the issue, using both carrots (money) and sticks (the threat of consequences under No Child Left Behind) to push them to evaluate teachers based on studentsâ€™ test scores, to adopt the Common Core standards in reading and math, and to make it easier for charter schools to open.
