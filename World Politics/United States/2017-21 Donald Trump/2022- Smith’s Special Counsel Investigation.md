## Original Trump and Nauta Federal Inditement
- [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_prosecution_of_Donald_Trump)
- On 8 June 2023, Trump was indited on 37 charges including Wilful Retention of National Defence Information, Conspiracy to Obstruct Justice, Withholding a Document or Record, Corruptly Concealing a Document or Record, Concealing a Document in a Federal Investigation, Scheme to Conceal and False Statements and Representations. An aide to Trump, Walt Nauta was also indited for the same charges barring Wilful Retention of National Defence Information.
    - `The classified documents TRUMP stored in his boxes included information regarding defense and weapons capabilities of both the United States and foreign countries; United States nuclear programs; potential vulnerabilities of the United States and its allies to military attack; and plans for possible retaliation in response to as-foreign attack. The unauthorized disclosure of these classified documents could put at risk the national security of the United States, foreign relations, the safety of the United States military, and human sources and the continued viability of sensitive intelligence collection methods.`
      
      `At 12:00 p.m. on January 20, 2021, TRUMP ceased to be president. As he departed the White House, TRUMP caused scores of boxes, many of which contained classified documents, to be transported to The Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida, where he maintained his residence. TRUMP was not authorized to possess or retain those classified documents.` - [link](https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/trump-indictment-document/967835b8a14a6b03/full.pdf)
- On 9 June 2023, Trumps lawyers quit hours after the indictment was unsealed.
    - `Two lawyers working for former President Donald Trump have quit his legal team just a day after he was indicted on federal charges in connection to his handling of classified information.`
      
      `“For purposes of fighting the Greatest Witch Hunt of all time, now moving to the Florida Courts, I will be represented by Todd Blanche, Esq., and a firm to be named later,” Mr Trump wrote on Truth Social on Friday.
      
      `“I want to thank Jim Trusty and John Rowley for their work, but they were up against a very dishonest, corrupt, evil, and ‘sick’ group of people, the likes of which has not been seen before. We will be announcing additional lawyers in the coming days,” he added.
      
      `Mr Rowley and Mr Trusty issued a joint statement in which they said that they had “tendered our resignations as counsel to President Trump, and we will no longer represent him on either the indicted case or the January 6 investigation”.` - Trump lawyers quit hours after indictment | The Independent

## Further Recovered Documents
- On 21 May 2024, Trump handed in a further 4 documents totalling 6 pages with classification markings
    - `Remarkably, the report regarding the Mar-a-Lago search, conducted on December 15-16, 2023, uncovered four more responsive records. See id., Ex. D at 1-15 (four responsive records found at Mar-a-Lago on December 15-16, 2022). The certification misleadingly refers to these documents as "low-level ministerial documents" without any explicit mention whether they had classification markings, indicating only that one document includes "an explanation that it was no longer deemed classified' if not connected to the attachment, and this document had no attachment." Id. ¶ 49. To be clear, the four documents were responsive to the May 2022 subpoena: "On or about December 15, 2022," the former president's counsel informed the government that "a box containing four documents or partial documents, totaling six pages, with classification markings were found in a closet" of the Office's designated space at Mar-a-Lago and "[t]hose documents contained markings at the Secret level."`
      
      `The Office provided the entire box in which the four responsive records were located to the FBI on approximately January 5, 2023, in compliance with another subpoena. Id.11 That was still not the end of the production of responsive records. In complying with the subpoena to produce that box, the Office also provided the FBI with two additional documents responsive to the May 2022 subpoena: "one empty folder and another mostly empty folder marked" Classified Evening Summary" that were found in the former president's bedroom at Mar-a-Lago.` - [United States v.
