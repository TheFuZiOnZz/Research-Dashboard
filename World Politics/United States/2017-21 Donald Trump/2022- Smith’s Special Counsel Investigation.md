Really ashamed."
        - On July 26th, 2018:
            - "As the head of the executive branch and Commander in Chief, I have a unique, Constitutional responsibility to protect the Nation's classified information, including by controlling access to it. . .. More broadly, the issue of a former executive branch official's) security clearance raises larger questions about the practice of former officials maintaining access to our Nation's most sensitive secrets long after their time in Government has ended. Such access is particularly inappropriate when former officials have transitioned into highly partisan positions and seek to use real or perceived access to sensitive information to validate their political attacks. Any access granted to our Nation's secrets should be in furtherance of national, not personal, interests.""

        - Attorney, he was great, he did a great job. You know what? He said, he said that it - that it was him. That he was the one who deleted all of her emails, the 30,000 emails, because they basically dealt with her scheduling and her going to the gym and her having beauty appointments. And he was great.

    - `The classified documents TRUMP stored in his boxes included information regarding defense and weapons capabilities of both the United States and foreign countries; United States nuclear programs; potential vulnerabilities of the United States and its allies to military attack; and plans for possible retaliation in response to as-foreign attack. The unauthorized disclosure of these classified documents could put at risk the national security of the United States, foreign relations, the safety of the United States military, and human sources and the continued viability of sensitive intelligence collection methods.`
      
      `At 12:00 p.m. on January 20, 2021, TRUMP ceased to be president. As he departed the White House, TRUMP caused scores of boxes, many of which contained classified documents, to be transported to The Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida, where he maintained his residence.

      `âI want to thank Jim Trusty and John Rowley for their work, but they were up against a very dishonest, corrupt, evil, and âsickâ group of people, the likes of which has not been seen before. We will be announcing additional lawyers in the coming days,â he added.
      
      `Mr Rowley and Mr Trusty issued a joint statement in which they said that they had âtendered our resignations as counsel to President Trump, and we will no longer represent him on either the indicted case or the January 6 investigationâ.` - Trump lawyers quit hours after indictment | The Independent

## Further Recovered Documents
- On 21 May 2024, Trump handed in a further 4 documents totalling 6 pages with classification markings
    - `Remarkably, the report regarding the Mar-a-Lago search, conducted on December 15-16, 2023, uncovered four more responsive records. See id., Ex. D at 1-15 (four responsive records found at Mar-a-Lago on December 15-16, 2022). The certification misleadingly refers to these documents as "low-level ministerial documents" without any explicit mention whether they had classification markings, indicating only that one document includes "an explanation that it was no longer deemed classified' if not connected to the attachment, and this document had no attachment." Id. Â¶ 49. To be clear, the four documents were responsive to the May 2022 subpoena: "On or about December 15, 2022," the former president's counsel informed the government that "a box containing four documents or partial documents, totaling six pages, with classification markings were found in a closet" of the Office's designated space at Mar-a-Lago and "[t]hose documents contained markings at the Secret level."`
      
      `The Office provided the entire box in which the four responsive records were located to the FBI on approximately January 5, 2023, in compliance with another subpoena. Id.11 That was still not the end of the production of responsive records. In complying with the subpoena to produce that box, the Office also provided the FBI with two additional documents responsive to the May 2022 subpoena: "one empty folder and another mostly empty folder marked" Classified Evening Summary" that were found in the former president's bedroom at Mar-a-Lago.` - [United States v.

## Government's Motion for Immunity Decisions
- On 2 October 2024, A legal brief by the special counsel, Jack Smith, was partly unsealed which lays out his case for why Trump is not immune from prosecution on federal charges of plotting to overturn the 2020 election. It adds new details to the extensive public record of how Trump lost the race but attempted nonetheless to cling to power.
- Almost all names in the court filing have been redacted. however with information in the filing and other public information, corroboration for the names redacted is possible and have been compiled. [Unmasked Characters - United States v. TRUMP, Google Docs, 2024](https://docs.google.com/document/d/112_twBkr3x1XGMPrQ4MzvTAY8_-dPySQQHHD7RRXbWw/edit?pli=1)
- P5 has been determined to be Mike Roman, director of election day operations for Trump's 2020 presidential campaign.
	- `In the immediate post-election period, while the defendant claimed fraud without proof, his private operatives sought to create chaos,rather than seek clarity, at polling places where states were continuing to tabulate votes. For example, on November 4, P5 -a Campaign employee, agent, and co-conspirator ofthe defendant?tried to sow confusion when the ongoing vote count at the TCF Center in Detroit, Michigan, looked unfavorable for the defendant. There, when a colleague at the TCF Center told P5 "We think [a batch ofvotes heavily in Biden's favor is] right," P5 responded, âfind a reason it isnt,â âgive me options to file litigation,â and âeven ifitbis [sic].â When the colleague suggested that there was about to be unrestreminiscent of the Brooks Brothers Riot, a violent effort to stop the vote count in Florida after the 2000 presidential election, P5 responded, "Make them riotâ and âDo it!!!" The defendant's Campaign operatives and supporters used similar tactics at other tabulation centers, including in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and the defendant sometimes used the resulting confrontations to falsely claim that his election observers were being denied proper access, thus serving as a predicate to the defendant's claim that fraud must have occurred in the observers' absence.` - [United States v. Donald Trump (Smith, Involvement in January 6, Government's Motion for Immunity Decisions), 2024](https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/73357920e3c8d739/8fc8bfd0-full.pdf)
- P15 has been determined to be Nicholas F. Luna, Assistant to the President and Director of Oval Office Operations.
	- `It was at that pointâalone, watching news in real time, and with knowledge that rioters had breached the Capitol buildingâthat the defendant issued the 2:24 p.m. Tweet attacking Pence for refusing the defendant's entreaties to join the conspiracy and help overturn the results of the election. One minute later, the Secret Service wasforced to evacuate Pence to a secure location in the Capitol. This was roughly ninety minutes after Pence had announced publicly that he would not actunlawfully to overturn the election; the certification proceeding was underway; and the first breach ofthe Capitol building had occurred minutes before, at 2:12 p.m. At that point, the defendant's only hope to disrupt the certification proceeding and retain power was through his angry supporters. The defendant further revealed the private nature of his desperate conduct as a candidate, rather than a President, in an exchange (that the Government does not plan to use at trial) he had with aide P15 shortly after the 2:24 p.m. Tweet. Upon receiving a phone call alerting him that Pence had been taken to a secure location, P15 rushed to the dining room to inform the defendant in hopes that the defendant would take action to ensure Pence's safety. Instead, after P15 delivered the news, the defendant looked at him and said only, "So what?"` - [United States v.

	- `At one point long after the defendant had begun spreading false fraud claims, P15 a White House staffer traveling with the defendant, overheard him tell family members that "it doesn't matter if you won or lost the election. You still have to fight like hell.â` - [United States v.

- C3 has been determined to be Dominion Voting Systems. P38 has been determined to be Lee Chatfield, Michiganâs Speaker of the House. P39 has been determined to be Ronna McDaniel, RNC Chairwoman from 2017 to 2024.
	- `In mid-December, the defendant spoke with RNC Chairwoman P39 and asked her to publicize and promote a private report that had been released on December 13 that purported to identify flaws in the use of C3 machines in Antrim County, Michigan. P39 refused, telling the defendant that she already had discussed the report with P38 Michigan's Speaker of the House, who had told her that the report was inaccurate. P39 conveyed to the defendant P38's exact assessment: the report was âfucking nuts.â` - [United States v.
