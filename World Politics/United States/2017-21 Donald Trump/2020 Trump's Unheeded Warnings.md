- Seven days before Trump took charge, Trump’s administration was briefed by the outgoing Obama administration on how to respond to pandemics by using simulated scenarios. This being about a strain of influenza known as H9N2 and that health systems were crashing in Asia, overwhelmed by the demand. `Health officials warn that this could become the worst influenza pandemic since 1918,` Trump’s aides were told. But roughly two-thirds of the Trump representatives in that room are no longer serving in the Trump administration.

- Dr. Rick Bright, a former Department of Health and Human Services official, on May 5 was alleging that the Trump administration pressured him to award contracts on the basis of politics and disregarding scientific opinion. `I was pressured to let politics and cronyism drive decisions over the opinions of the best scientists we have in government,` Bright said on a call with reporters after filing his complaint. In a lengthy series of exhibits that was included with Bright's whistleblower complaint, some of the memos are provided, including warnings on shortages of masks and syringes to administer an eventual vaccine.
