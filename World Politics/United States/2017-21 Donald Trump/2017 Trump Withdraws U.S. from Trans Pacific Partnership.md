- The original TPP would have boosted U.S. exports and economic growth. This should create more jobs and prosperity for the 12 countries involved. It will increase exports by $305 billion per year by 2025. U.S. exports would increase by $123.5 billion. It would benefit the machinery, auto, plastics, and agriculture industries. It would have increased exports by removing 18,000 tariffs placed on U.S. exports to the other countries. The United States has already withdrawn 80% of these tariffs on imports. The TPP would have evened the playing field. The agreement would have added $223 billion a year to incomes of workers in all the countries, with $77 billion going to U.S. workers. Notably, the TPP excluded China. [link](https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-the-trans-pacific-partnership-3305581)

- The U.S. International Trade Commission report on its evaluation on the TPP was positive on all fronts. The Economy-Wide effects, `the TPP Agreement would increase annual U.S. GDP in 2032 relative to the 2032 baseline by $42.7 billion in 2017 dollars, or by 0.15 percent of total U.S. GDP`Broad Sector Level Effects, `While output and employment would increase in the overall economy due to TPP, this change would be driven by expansion in the agriculture and food sector and the services sector. In dollar terms, the output of the services sector would expand the most ($42.3 billion) relative to its baseline volume in 2032` Industry Level Effects `Sectors benefiting from the most extensive liberalization measures tend to expand production and exports as they become relatively more competitive in the world economy: these are the direct effects of TPP.` [link](https://www.usitc.gov/publications/332/pub4607.pdf)
