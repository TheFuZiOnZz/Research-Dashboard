### 2020 Pence Disbanding Coronavirus Task Force
- Pence told reporters on May 6, that the coronavirus task force created to manage the federal government’s response to the pandemic could be disbanded within a month because `of the tremendous progress we’ve made as a country.` [link](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/05/05/coronavirus-update-us/) Pence portrayed the task force as having accomplished its goal as the U.S. outbreak -- the largest in the world -- plateaus. There have been nearly 1.2 million cases of Covid-19 and more than 70,000 deaths from the disease, but states are beginning to try to reopen businesses and lift social-distancing regulations as the growth of the outbreak slows. On Sunday, Trump revised upward the number of the deaths he expects from the outbreak, saying the total could reach 100,000. In April he had said he thought between 50,000 and 60,000 Americans would die. [link](https://fortune.com/2020/05/05/coronavirus-task-force-white-house/)
