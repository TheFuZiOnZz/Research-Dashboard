### 2020 Trump Administration Ignoring The CDC On Reopening Us During Pandemic
- The Trump administration said they will not implement the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 17-page draft recommendation for reopening America, a senior CDC official confirmed on 7 May. `The 17-page report represents an ask from the White House Task Force to come up with these recommendations. That's our role. To put together this guidance.` A task force official told CNN that Trumpâ€™s guidelines announced in mid-April for reopening the country `made clear that each state should open up in a safe and responsible way based on the data and response efforts in those individual states.` An administration official told CNN that CDC leadership had not seen the draft document before it was leaked, and there were two concerns when it reached the task force. It was `overly prescriptive` because `guidance in rural Tennessee shouldn't be the same guidance for urban New York City,` and the recommendations in the document did not fit the `phases` that had already been outlined by the task force. `I want to go back to where it was, that's where we're going to be,` Trump said.
