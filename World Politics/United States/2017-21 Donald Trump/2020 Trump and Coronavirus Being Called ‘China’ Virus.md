### 2020 Trump and Coronavirus Being Called ‘China’ Virus
- Trump has been quoted over 20 times in various Press Conferences, Interviews and Tweets. [link](https://factba.se/search\#Chinese%2Bvirus) His deliberateness of the wording was made clear when a photographer captured the script of his speech wherein Trump had crossed out the word `Corona` and replaced it with `Chinese.` [link](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/03/20/coronavirus-trump-chinese-virus/) When faced with accusations of racism, he dismissed its impact on Asian Americans, saying: `It’s not racist at all. No, it’s not at all. It’s from China. That’s why. It comes from China. I want to be accurate.` [link](https://youtu.be/JgDcS-ZBH0k?t=1417) [link](https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-press-conference-coronavirus-briefing-march-18-2020)
- By early March, racist acts and harassment against Asians had already surged and they continued to spike through March and into April.

That is why the WHO has had a strict guideline since 2015 regarding the naming of diseases, a guideline followed by other world leaders.

- The expressions `Chinese virus` and `Wuhan virus` personify the threat. Personification is metaphorical: its purpose is to help understand something unfamiliar and abstract (i.e. the virus) by using terms that are familiar and embodied (i.e. a location, a nationality or a person). But as cognitive linguists George Lakoff and Mark Johnson have long shown, metaphors are not just poetic tools, they are used constantly and shape our world view. [link](https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/M/bo3637992.html) The adjective `Chinese` is particularly problematic as it associates the infection with an ethnicity. Talking about group identities with an explicitly medical language [link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2690128/) is a recognized process of Othering, [link](https://tidsskrift.dk/qual/article/view/5510) [link](https://books.google.fr/books?hl=en&lr=&id=aB6pAgAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PT306&dq=othering+identity+) historically used in anti-immigrant rhetoric and policy, including toward Chinese immigrants in North America. This type of language stokes anxiety, resentment, fear and disgust toward people associated with that group.

- Trump in those multiple tweets has been seen using the phrase and has defended [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zatCqqRY_I) and said he’ll stop using the term, `I don’t regret it, but they accused us of having done it through our soldiers, they said our soldiers did it on purpose, what kind of a thing is that?` Trump said in an interview Tuesday with Fox News. `Look, everyone knows it came out of China, but I decided we shouldn’t make any more of a big deal out of it. I think I made a big deal. I think people understand it. But that all began when they said our soldiers started it. Our soldiers had nothing to do with it.` [link](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-25/trump-says-he-ll-stop-using-chinese-virus-easing-blame-game) Sars-Cov-2 is the appropriate name for the new coronavirus recognised by medical professionals in Lancet.
