### 2016-21 Trump Drone Strikes
- According to an analysis from Micah Zenko, an analyst with the Council on Foreign Relations, Trump has markedly increased U.S. drone strikes since taking office. Zenko, who reported earlier this year on the over 26,000 bombs Obama dropped in 2016, summarized the increase: “During President Obama’s two terms in office, he approved 542 such targeted strikes in 2,920 days—one every 5.4 days. From his inauguration through today, Trump had approved at least 36 drone strikes or raids in 45 days—one every 1.25 days.

- Trump revoked an Obama-era policy requiring US intelligence officials report civilian drone strike deaths outside of war zones.

In Yemen, for example, a third of the deaths are civilians, not terrorists [link](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2018/11/14/hidden-toll-of-us-drone-strikes-in-yemen-nearly-a-third-of-deaths-are-civilians-not-al-qaida/) “U.S. Air Forces Central Command data shows that coalition aircraft (excluding the Afghan Air Force) dropped 7,423 weapons in 2019, slightly higher than the 7,362 dropped in 2018” [link](https://www.statista.com/chart/16079/weapons-released-by-the-us-coalition-over-afghanistan/) “That increase can primarily be attributed to a change in the rules of engagement which allows coalition forces to open fire on the enemy without having to be in close contact with them. The change was orchestrated by former Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis who wanted to remove such restrictions in order to use air power to its full potential and defeat the enemy. The change, combined with more air strikes by the Afghan Air Force, has also led to a spike in civilian deaths. Last summer, the United Nations announced that Afghan and U.S. forces killed more civilians in the first half of 2019 than insurgents.” [link](https://www.statista.com/chart/16079/weapons-released-by-the-us-coalition-over-afghanistan/)
- On 16 March 2017 Trump submitted his request to Congress for $639 billion in military spending—$54 billion—which represents a 10 percent increase—for FY 2018 as well as $30 billion for FY2017 which ends in September. With a total federal budget of $3.9 trillion for FY2018, the increase in military spending would result in deep cuts to many other federal agencies and domestic programs, as well as the State Department.
