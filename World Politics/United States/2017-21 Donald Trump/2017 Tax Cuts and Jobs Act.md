### 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
- On his first day in office, Trump reversed a middle class tax cut in mortgage insurance premiums issued by the Federal Housing Administration. These insurance fees are effectively a tax on middle-class homeownership. For a mortgage worth $200,000, this adds $500 to a homebuyer’s annual costs.

- Trump's tax proposal (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017) would reduce the corporate tax rate to 20% from 35%. The Trump Treasury Department released a one-page summary of the nearly 500-page Senate tax bill that suggested the tax cut would more than pay for itself, based on an assumption of higher economic growth than any independent analysis had forecast.

- The CBO estimated in April 2018 that implementing the Act would add an estimated $2.289 trillion to the national debt over ten years. [link](https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/115th-congress-2017-2018/reports/53651-outlook.pdf\#page=133)
- Analysis conducted by The New York Times in November 2019 found that average business investment was lower after the tax cut than before, and that firms receiving larger tax relief increased investment less than firms receiving smaller tax relief. The analysis also found that since the tax cut firms increased dividends and stock buybacks by nearly three times as much as they increased capital investments.

- A study found ‘379 large, profitable U.S. companies in 2018 paid an effective tax rate of 11.3%’, the first year the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was in force. That's slightly more than half of the nominal corporate tax rate of 21%, which itself was reduced by the TCJA from a previous rate of 35%.

- Trump’s Treasury Department has been on record for Deleted Research That Contradicts Republicans on Tax Reform. `In an interview on Fox News last month, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin made a sales pitch for the GOP’s tax reform plan—specifically, its plan to cut corporate taxes. `Most economists believe that over 70 percent of corporate taxes are paid for by the workers,` he said. His implication, in layman's terms: Regular workers would get 70 percent of the benefit of corporate tax cuts.` [link](https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2017/10/trumps-treasury-department-deleted-research-that-contradicts-republicans-on-tax-reform/)
- Another study found 83% of the benefits of the Trump tax bill will go to the top 1%, `We find the bill would reduce taxes on average for all income groups in both 2018 and 2025.` ` On average, in 2027 taxes would change little for lower- and middle-income groups and decrease for higher-income groups. Compared to current law, 5 percent of taxpayers would pay more tax in 2018, 9 percent in 2025, and 53 percent in 2027.` [link](https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/distributional-analysis-conference-agreement-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act)
