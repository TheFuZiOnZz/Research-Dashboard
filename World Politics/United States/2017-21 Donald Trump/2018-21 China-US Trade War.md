### 2018-21 China-US Trade War
- Trump in 2018 began setting tariffs and other trade barriers on China with the goal of forcing it to make changes to what the U.S. says are "unfair trade practices" [link](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/05/business/china-us-trade-war-trump-tariffs.html) Among those trade practices and their effects are the growing trade deficit, the theft of intellectual property, and the forced transfer of American technology to China.

- Trump stated that he would spend the tens of billions of dollars in tariffs from China to buy products from "Great Patriot Farmers" and distribute the food to starving people in nations around the world [link](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1127681372896800768) [link](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1127681373966409730) According to an August 2019 USDA report, as American wheat exports "plunged", Canadian wheat exports "rocketed" from 32% to more than 60% of Chinese wheat imports during the most recent marketing year.

- Since the 1980s, Trump has advocated tariffs to reduce the U.S. trade deficit and promote domestic manufacturing, saying the country was being "ripped off" by its trading partners; imposing tariffs became a major plank of his presidential campaign. Although some economists and politicians argue that the United States' persistent trade deficit is problematic, many economists argue that it is not a problem.

- According to a January 14, 2019 article in the Wall Street Journal, despite US-imposed tariffs, in 2018 China's annual trade surplus was $323.32 billion, a record high. [link](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-annual-trade-surplus-with-u-s-hits-record-despite-trumps-tariff-offensive-11547439977) On February 6, 2018, The New York Times reported that in 2017 the trade deficit had also reached a record high. [link](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/06/us/politics/us-china-trade-deficit.html) In March 2019, the U.S. Department of Commerce stated that in 2018 the U.S. trade deficit reached $621 billion, the highest it had been since 2008.

- Over 600 companies and trade associations wrote to Trump in mid-2019 to ask him to remove tariffs and end the trade war, saying that increased tariffs would have "a significant, negative, and long-term impact on American businesses, farmers, families, and the US economy".

- Biden commented on what was accomplished in the phase one deal, Biden said, “[It] won’t actually resolve the real issues at the heart of the dispute, including industrial subsidies, support for state-owned enterprises, cybertheft, and other predatory practices in trade and technology.” While the United States was able to gain certain market access commitments in the deal, it required a $28 billion bailout to farmers, more than double the auto bailout that Biden assisted with following the 2008 financial crisis. Biden has not directly addressed if he would end the tariffs, though he’s made clear that the costs have not been worth what Trump has managed to extract from China thus far.

- Biden Is in support of `Quadruple funding for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership. America’s small manufacturers need help. On the heels of the Trump Administration’s reckless trade wars, our country’s manufacturing sector has been thrown into a full-blown recession. Righting American manufacturing will require smarter, less erratic trade policies – but it also begins with giving small manufacturers the tools they need to succeed.` [link](https://joebiden.com/infrastructure/)
