- Protectionism is trying to use restrictions such as tariffs to boost your country's industry, and shield it from foreign competition making goods made in said country more expensive to make and purchase. Take Trump's steel and aluminium tariffs. In May 2018, the president announced a 25% tariff on all steel imports, and 10% on aluminium. [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-44320221)
- The Trump administration claims the US relies too much on other countries for its metals, and that it couldn't make enough weapons or vehicles using its own industry if a war broke out. Critics point out the US gets most of its steel from Canada and the EU - staunch US allies. [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-43512098)
- Trump argued that the tariffs enriched the United States. He said the United States was gaining `Billions of Dollars` from `Tariffs being charged to China`. He added, `If companies don't want to pay Tariffs, build in the U.S.A. Otherwise, let's just make our Country richer than ever before!` Fact-checkers and economists described the assertions made by Trump as false, with the Associated Press writing `Almost all economists say the president is wrong. That's because tariffs are taxes on imports. They can cause higher prices, reduce trade among countries and hurt overall economic growth as a result.` [link](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/29/us/politics/how-tariffs-work-china.html) [link](https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2018/12/05/ap-fact-check-economists-say-trump-off-on-tariffs-impact)
- A study published in fall 2019 in the Journal of Economic Perspectives found that by December 2018, Trump’s tariffs resulted in a reduction in aggregate U.S. real income of $1.4 billion per month in deadweight losses, and cost U.S. consumers an additional $3.2 billion per month in added tax. The study's authors noted that these were conservative measures of the losses from the tariffs, because they did not take account of the tariffs' effects in reducing the variety of products available to consumers, or the tariff-related costs attributable to policy uncertainty or the fixed costs incurred by companies to reorganize their global supply chains.

- A study by Federal Reserve Board economists found that the tariffs reduced employment in the American manufacturing sector. [link](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2019086pap.pdf)
- An April 2019 working paper by economists found that the tariffs on washing machines caused the prices of washers to increase by approximately twelve percent in the United States. [link](http://www.nber.org/papers/w25767)
- A 2019 paper by Federal Reserve Board economists found that the steel tariffs led to 0.6% fewer jobs in the manufacturing sector than would have happened in the absence of the tariffs; this amounted to approximately 75,000 jobs.

- Analysis conducted by Deutsche Bank estimated that Trump’s trade actions had resulted in foregone American stock market capitalization of $5 trillion through May 2019. [[trumpstradewarshavecostthestockmarket]]
- Trump announced on August 1, 2019, that he would impose a 10% tariff on $300 billion of Chinese imports beginning September 1; four days later the Chinese Commerce Ministry announced that China was halting imports of all American agricultural goods. American Farm Bureau Federation data showed that agriculture exports to China fell from $19.5 billion in 2017 to $9.1 billion in 2018, a 53% decline. [link](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-agriculture-idUSKCN1UV0XJ) The figure was $21.4 billion in 2016.

- Between the time Trump took office in 2017 through March 2019, the U.S.'s trade deficit grew by $119 billion, reaching $621 billion, the highest it had been since 2008. [link](https://www.npr.org/2019/03/06/700650144/despite-trumps-promises-the-trade-deficit-is-only-getting-wider)
- The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reported its estimate of the U.S. economic impact from Trump’s trade policies in August 2019. By 2020, tariffs would reduce the level of real U.S. GDP by about 0.3%, reduce real consumption by 0.3%, reduce real private investment by 1.3%, and reduce real household income by $580 (about 1%). Real U.S. exports would be 1.7% lower and real imports would be 2.6% lower. CBO explained tariffs reduce U.S. economic activity in three ways: 1) Consumer and capital goods become more expensive; 2) Business uncertainty increases, thereby reducing or slowing investment; and 3) Other countries impose retaliatory tariffs, making U.S. exports more expensive and thus reducing them. CBO estimated the U.S. had imposed tariffs on 11% of imports by January 2018. As of July 25, 2019, retaliatory tariffs had been imposed on 7% of all U.S. goods exports. CBO expects the negative consequences will remain but have a smaller impact in 2029, as businesses adjust their supply chains (i.e., source from countries not affected by tariffs).

- Free trade is the opposite of protectionism which means as few tariffs as possible, giving people the freedom to buy cheaper or better-made products from anywhere in the world. It is widely regarded by economists to be more free trade and less protectionist as `Freer trade improves productive efficiency and offers consumers better choices, and in the long run these gains are much larger than any effects on employment.`, 29% Strongly Agree, 56% Agree, 5% Uncertain, no one in this survey disagreed.
