### Trump’s Inherited Economy
- Both the ‘Good economy’ and ‘Low Unemployment Rates’ were inherited from Obama’s Presidency. [link](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/02/business/economy/jobs-report.html) [link](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/fact-check-economy-booming-who-gets-credit-trump-or-obama-n908286)
- Trump claimed the US now has the `best jobs numbers ever.` More jobs were created in the 31 final full months of Obama's presidency (6.91 million) than during the 31 first full months of Trump’s presidency (5.85 million).

- Trump said he had to rebuild the US military because it had been `totally depleted` under Obama's tenure. It's misleading for Trump to claim the military was `totally depleted` when he took office. While average defense spending per year has increased under Trump, the US spent around the same amount on the military over both Obama and Trump’s first three years in office respectively.

- With his comments about the `Fed Rate` being zero under Obama and up since his tenure, Trump is arguing that Obama got more help from the Federal Reserve in boosting the economy. It's true that Fed policies helped the economy recover from the Great Recession under Obama, and while its key interest rate is higher now than it ever was under the previous president-- it was cut last year for the first time since 2008.

- Responding to Obama's claim that the Recovery Act passed under his administration set the country on a path to economic success, Trump claimed Obama actually had `the weakest recovery since the Great Depression.` If you look solely at the average rate of GDP growth, it's true that the economy recovered more slowly after the Great Recession than during previous rebounds. But growth hasn't been exceptionally better under Trump. [link](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/02/18/politics/trump-v-obama-economy-fact-check/index.html)
- Writing in The New York Times, Steven Rattner explained in August 2018 that `Yes, the economy is continuing to expand nicely, which all Americans should celebrate. But no, there’s nothing remarkable in the overall results since Mr. Trump took office. Most importantly, there is little evidence that the president’s policies have meaningfully improved the fortunes of those 'forgotten' Americans who elected him.` [link](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/03/opinion/trump-jobs-economy.html)
- A study found that there's no evidence that Trump has affected the economy positively, `The impact of President Trump on the macroeconomic performance of the US economy has been negligible so far. We measure neither an acceleration of growth nor increased job creation in the US economy relative to an appropriate benchmark.` [link](https://voxeu.org/article/stable-genius-estimating-trump-effect-us-economy)
- Trump’s cabinet, even the current chair of the Council of Economic Advisors, lacks economists with academic experience. [[somethingmi]]
