- On 1 July 2024, SCOTUS held that President’s are entitled to `Presumptive Immunity`
- Syllabus
    - `When the President exercises such authority, Congress cannot act on, and courts cannot examine, the President’s actions. It follows that an Act of Congress—either a specific one targeted at the President or a generally applicable one—may not criminalize the President’s actions within his exclusive constitutional power. Neither may the courts adjudicate a criminal prosecution that examines such Presidential actions.` - [Trump v. United States (Absolute Immunity SCOTUS Case), Supreme Court of the United States, 2024](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf)
    - `The reasons that justify the President’s absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for acts within the scope of his exclusive constitutional authority do not extend to conduct in areas where his authority is shared with Congress.` - [Trump v. United States (Absolute Immunity SCOTUS Case), Supreme Court of the United States, 2024](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf)
    - `the Court concludes that the separation of powers principles explicated in the Court’s precedent necessitate at least a presumptive immunity from criminal prosecution for a President’s acts within the outer perimeter of his official responsibility. Such an immunity is required to safeguard the independence and effective functioning of the Executive Branch, and to enable the President to carry out his constitutional duties without undue caution. At a minimum, the President must be immune from prosecution for an official act unless the Government can show that applying a criminal prohibition to that act would pose no “dangers of intrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch.” Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 754. Pp. 12–15.` - [Trump v. United States (Absolute Immunity SCOTUS Case), Supreme Court of the United States, 2024](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf)
    - `As for a President’s unofficial acts, there is no immunity. Although Presidential immunity is required for official actions to ensure that the President’s decisionmaking is not distorted by the threat of future litigation stemming from those actions, that concern does not support immunity for unofficial conduct. Clinton, 520 U. S., at 694, and n. 19. The separation of powers does not bar a prosecution predicated on the President’s unofficial acts. P. 15.` - [Trump v. United States (Absolute Immunity SCOTUS Case), Supreme Court of the United States, 2024](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf)
    - `The immunity the Court has recognized therefore extends to the “outer perimeter” of the President’s official responsibilities, covering actions so long as they are “not manifestly or palpably beyond [his] authority.” Blassingame v. Trump, 87 F. 4th 1, 13 (CADC).` - [Trump v. United States (Absolute Immunity SCOTUS Case), Supreme Court of the United States, 2024](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf)
    - `In dividing official from unofficial conduct, courts may not inquire into the President’s motives. Such a “highly intrusive” inquiry would risk exposing even the most obvious instances of official conduct to judicial examination on the mere allegation of improper purpose. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 756.` - [Trump v. United States (Absolute Immunity SCOTUS Case), Supreme Court of the United States, 2024](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf)
    - `Because the President cannot be prosecuted for conduct within his exclusive constitutional authority, Trump is absolutely immune from prosecution for the alleged conduct involving his discussions with Justice Department officials.` - [Trump v. United States (Absolute Immunity SCOTUS Case), Supreme Court of the United States, 2024](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf)
    - `Whenever the President and Vice President discuss their official responsibilities, they engage in official conduct. Presiding over the January 6 certification proceeding at which Members of Congress count the electoral votes is a constitutional and statutory duty of the Vice President. Art. II, §1, cl. 3; Amdt. 12; 3 U. S. C. §15. The indictment’s allegations that Trump attempted to pressure the Vice President to take particular acts in connection with his role at the certification proceeding thus involve official conduct, and Trump is at least presumptively immune from prosecution for such conduct.` - [Trump v. United States (Absolute Immunity SCOTUS Case), Supreme Court of the United States, 2024](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf)
    - `The question then becomes whether that presumption of immunity is rebutted under the circumstances. It is the Government’s burden to rebut the presumption of immunity. The Court therefore remands to the District Court to assess in the first instance whether a prosecution involving Trump’s alleged attempts to influence the Vice President’s oversight of the certification proceeding would pose any dangers of intrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch. Pp. 21–24.` - [Trump v. United States (Absolute Immunity SCOTUS Case), Supreme Court of the United States, 2024](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf)
    - `Determining whose characterization may be correct, and with respect to which conduct, requires a fact-specific analysis of the indictment’s extensive and interrelated allegations. The Court accordingly remands to the District Court to determine in the first instance whether Trump’s conduct in this area qualifies as official or unofficial. Pp. 24–28.` - [Trump v. United States (Absolute Immunity SCOTUS Case), Supreme Court of the United States, 2024](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf)
    - `Presidents cannot be indicted based on conduct for which they are immune from prosecution. On remand, the District Court must carefully analyze the indictment’s remaining allegations to determine whether they too involve conduct for which a President must be immune from prosecution. And the parties and the District Court must ensure that sufficient allegations support the indictment’s charges without such conduct. Testimony or private records of the President or his advisers probing such conduct may not be admitted as evidence at trial. Pp. 30–32.` - [Trump v. United States (Absolute Immunity SCOTUS Case), Supreme Court of the United States, 2024](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf)
    - `The Federalist Papers on which Trump relies concerned the checks available against a sitting President; they did not endorse or even consider whether the Impeachment Judgment Clause immunizes a former President from prosecution. Transforming the political process of impeachment into a necessary step in the enforcement of criminal law finds little support in the text of the Constitution or the structure of the Nation’s Government. Pp. 32–34.` - [Trump v. United States (Absolute Immunity SCOTUS Case), Supreme Court of the United States, 2024](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf)
    - `This case poses a question of lasting significance: When may a former President be prosecuted for official acts taken during his Presidency? In answering that question, unlike the political branches and the public at large, the Court cannot afford to fixate exclusively, or even primarily, on present exigencies. Enduring separation of powers principles guide our decision in this case. The President enjoys no immunity for his unofficial acts, and not everything the President does is official. The President is not above the law. But under our system of separated powers, the President may not be prosecuted for exercising his core constitutional powers, and he is entitled to at least presumptive immunity from prosecution for his official acts. That immunity applies equally to all occupants of the Oval Office.` - [Trump v. United States (Absolute Immunity SCOTUS Case), Supreme Court of the United States, 2024](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf)
- Justice Roberts Opinion of the Court
    - `We granted certiorari to consider the following question: “Whether and if so to what extent does a former President enjoy presidential immunity from criminal prosecution for conduct alleged to involve official acts during his tenure in office.”` - [Trump v. United States (Absolute Immunity SCOTUS Case), Supreme Court of the United States, 2024](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf)
    - `This case is the first criminal prosecution in our Nation’s history of a former President for actions taken during his Presidency. We are called upon to consider whether and under what circumstances such a prosecution may proceed. Doing so requires careful assessment of the scope of Presidential power under the Constitution. We undertake that responsibility conscious that we must not confuse “the issue of a power’s validity with the cause it is invoked to promote,” but must instead focus on the “enduring consequences upon the balanced power structure of our Republic.”` - [Trump v. United States (Absolute Immunity SCOTUS Case), Supreme Court of the United States, 2024](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf)
    - `If the President claims authority to act but in fact exercises mere “individual will” and “authority without law,” the courts may say so. Youngstown, 343 U. S., at 655 (Jackson, J., concurring). In Youngstown, for instance, we held that President Truman exceeded his constitutional authority when he seized most of the Nation’s steel mills. See id., at 582–589 (majority opinion). But once it is determined that the President acted within the scope of his exclusive authority, his discretion in exercising such authority cannot be subject to further judicial examination.` - [Trump v. United States (Absolute Immunity SCOTUS Case), Supreme Court of the United States, 2024](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf)
    - `At a minimum, the President must therefore be immune from prosecution for an official act unless the Government can show that applying a criminal prohibition to that act would pose no “dangers of intrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch.” Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 754.` - [Trump v. United States (Absolute Immunity SCOTUS Case), Supreme Court of the United States, 2024](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf)
    - `And some Presidential conduct—for example, speaking to and on behalf of the American people, see Trump v. Hawaii, 585 U. S. 667, 701 (2018)—certainly can qualify as official even when not obviously connected to a particular constitutional or statutory provision. For those reasons, the immunity we have recognized extends to the “outer perimeter” of the President’s official responsibilities, covering actions so long as they are “not manifestly or palpably beyond [his] authority.”` - [Trump v. United States (Absolute Immunity SCOTUS Case), Supreme Court of the United States, 2024](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf)
    - `In dividing official from unofficial conduct, courts may not inquire into the President’s motives. Such an inquiry would risk exposing even the most obvious instances of official conduct to judicial examination on the mere allegation of improper purpose, thereby intruding on the Article II interests that immunity seeks to protect.` - [Trump v. United States (Absolute Immunity SCOTUS Case), Supreme Court of the United States, 2024](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf)
    - `The indictment’s allegations that the requested investigations were “sham[s]” or proposed for an improper purpose do not divest the President of exclusive authority over the investigative and prosecutorial functions of the Justice Department and its officials. App. 186–187, Indictment ¶10(c). And the President cannot be prosecuted for conduct within his exclusive constitutional authority. Trump is therefore absolutely immune from prosecution for the alleged conduct involving his discussions with Justice Department officials.` - [Trump v. United States (Absolute Immunity SCOTUS Case), Supreme Court of the United States, 2024](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf)
    - `Whenever the President and Vice President discuss their official responsibilities, they engage in official conduct. Presiding over the January 6 certification proceeding at which Members of Congress count the electoral votes is a constitutional and statutory duty of the Vice President. Art. II, §1, cl. 3; Amdt. 12; 3 U. S. C. §15. The indictment’s allegations that Trump attempted to pressure the Vice President to take particular acts in connection with his role at the certification proceeding thus involve official conduct, and Trump is at least presumptively immune from prosecution for such conduct.` - [Trump v. United States (Absolute Immunity SCOTUS Case), Supreme Court of the United States, 2024](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf)
    - `It is ultimately the Government’s burden to rebut the presumption of immunity. We therefore remand to the District Court to assess in the first instance, with appropriate input from the parties, whether a prosecution involving Trump’s alleged attempts to influence the Vice President’s oversight of the certification proceeding in his capacity as President of the Senate would pose any dangers of intrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch.` - [Trump v. United States (Absolute Immunity SCOTUS Case), Supreme Court of the United States, 2024](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf)
    - `Congress may prescribe when the state-appointed electors shall meet, and it counts and certifies their votes. Art. II, §1, cls. 3, 4. The President, meanwhile, plays no direct role in the process, nor does he have authority to control the state officials who do. And the Framers, wary of “cabal, intrigue and corruption,” specifically excluded from service as electors “all those who from situation might be suspected of too great devotion to the president in office.” The Federalist No. 68, at 459 (A. Hamilton); see Art. II, §1, cl. 2.` - [Trump v. United States (Absolute Immunity SCOTUS Case), Supreme Court of the United States, 2024](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf)
    - `Unlike Trump’s alleged interactions with the Justice Department, this alleged conduct cannot be neatly categorized as falling within a particular Presidential function. The necessary analysis is instead fact specific, requiring assessment of numerous alleged interactions with a wide variety of state officials and private persons. And the parties’ brief comments at oral argument indicate that they starkly disagree on the characterization of these allegations. The concerns we noted at the outset—the expedition of this case, the lack of factual analysis by the lower courts, and the absence of pertinent briefing by the parties—thus become more prominent. We accordingly remand to the District Court to determine in the first instance—with the benefit of briefing we lack—whether Trump’s conduct in this area qualifies as official or unofficial.` - [Trump v. United States (Absolute Immunity SCOTUS Case), Supreme Court of the United States, 2024](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf)
    - `Indeed, a long-recognized aspect of Presidential power is using the office’s “bully pulpit” to persuade Americans, including by speaking forcefully or critically, in ways that the President believes would advance the public interest. He is even expected to comment on those matters of public concern that may not directly implicate the activities of the Federal Government—for instance, to comfort the Nation in the wake of an emergency or tragedy. For these reasons, most of a President’s public communications are likely to fall comfortably within the outer perimeter of his official responsibilities.` - [Trump v. United States (Absolute Immunity SCOTUS Case), Supreme Court of the United States, 2024](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf)
    - `The indictment reflects these challenges. It includes only select Tweets and brief snippets of the speech Trump delivered on the morning of January 6, omitting its full text or context. See App. 228–230, Indictment ¶104. Whether the Tweets, that speech, and Trump’s other communications on January 6 involve official conduct may depend on the content and context of each. Knowing, for instance, what else was said contemporaneous to the excerpted communications, or who was involved in transmitting the electronic communications and in organizing the rally, could be relevant to the classification of each communication. This necessarily factbound analysis is best performed initially by the District Court. We therefore remand to the District Court to determine in the first instance whether this alleged conduct is official or unofficial.` - [Trump v. United States (Absolute Immunity SCOTUS Case), Supreme Court of the United States, 2024](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf)
    - `The implication of Trump’s theory is that a President who evades impeachment for one reason or another during his term in office can never be held accountable for his criminal acts in the ordinary course of law. So if a President manages to conceal certain crimes throughout his Presidency, or if Congress is unable to muster the political will to impeach the President for his crimes, then they must forever remain impervious to prosecution. Impeachment is a political process by which Congress can remove a President who has committed “Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.” Art. II, §4. Transforming that political process into a necessary step in the enforcement of criminal law finds little support in the text of the Constitution or the structure of our Government.` - [Trump v. United States (Absolute Immunity SCOTUS Case), Supreme Court of the United States, 2024](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf)
    - `As for the dissents, they strike a tone of chilling doom that is wholly disproportionate to what the Court actually does today—conclude that immunity extends to official discussions between the President and his Attorney General, and then remand to the lower courts to determine “in the first instance” whether and to what extent Trump’s remaining alleged conduct is entitled to immunity. Supra, at 24, 28, 30.`
      
      `The principal dissent’s starting premise—that unlike Speech and Debate Clause immunity, no constitutional text supports Presidential immunity, see post, at 4–6 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.)—is one that the Court rejected decades ago as “unpersuasive.” Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 750, n. 31; see also Nixon, 418 U. S., at 705–706, n. 16 (rejecting unanimously a similar argument in the analogous executive privilege context). “[A] specific textual basis has not been considered a prerequisite to the recognition of immunity.”` - [Trump v. United States (Absolute Immunity SCOTUS Case), Supreme Court of the United States, 2024](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf)
	    - `Petitioner, as a former President of the United States, is entitled to absolute immunity from damages liability predicated on his official acts. Pp. 457 U. S. 744-758.`
	      
	      `(a) Although there is no blanket recognition of absolute immunity for all federal executive officials from liability for civil damages resulting from constitutional violations, certain officials -- such as judges and prosecutors -- because of the special nature of their responsibilities, require absolute exemption from liability. Cf. Butz v. Economou, 438 U. S. 478. Determination of the immunity of particular officials is guided by the Constitution, federal statutes, history, and public policy. Pp. 457 U. S. 744-748.` - [Nixon v. Fitzgerald, Supreme Court of the United States, 1982](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf)
	    - `The plaintiff in this lawsuit seeks relief in civil damages from a former President of the United States. The claim rests on actions allegedly taken in the former President's official capacity during his tenure in office. The issue before us is the scope of the immunity possessed by the President of the United States.` - [Nixon v. Fitzgerald, Supreme Court of the United States, 1982](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf)
    - `As the Court has previously noted, relevant historical evidence on the question of Presidential immunity is of a “fragmentary character.” Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 752, n. 31; see also Clinton, 520 U. S., at 696–697; cf. Youngstown, 343 U. S., at 634 (Jackson, J., concurring) (noting “the poverty of really useful and unambiguous authority applicable to concrete problems of executive power”). “[T]he most compelling arguments,” therefore, “arise from the Constitution’s separation of powers and the Judiciary’s historic understanding of that doctrine.” Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 752, n. 31.` - [Trump v. United States (Absolute Immunity SCOTUS Case), Supreme Court of the United States, 2024](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf)
    - `Our first President had such a perspective. In his Farewell Address, George Washington reminded the Nation that “a Government of as much vigour as is consistent with the perfect security of Liberty is indispensable.” 35 Writings of George Washington 226 (J. Fitzpatrick ed. 1940). A government “too feeble to withstand the enterprises of faction,” he warned, could lead to the “frightful despotism” of “alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by the spirit of revenge.” Id., at 226–227. And the way to avoid that cycle, he explained, was to ensure that government powers remained “properly distributed and adjusted.” Id., at 226.`
      
      `It is these enduring principles that guide our decision in this case. The President enjoys no immunity for his unofficial acts, and not everything the President does is official. The President is not above the law. But Congress may not criminalize the President’s conduct in carrying out the responsibilities of the Executive Branch under the Constitution. And the system of separated powers designed by the Framers has always demanded an energetic, independent Executive. The President therefore may not be prosecuted for exercising his core constitutional powers, and he is entitled, at a minimum, to a presumptive immunity from prosecution for all his official acts. That immunity applies equally to all occupants of the Oval Office, regardless of politics, policy, or party.` - [Trump v. United States (Absolute Immunity SCOTUS Case), 2024](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf)
	    - `All obstructions to the execution of the laws, all combinations and associations under whatever plausible character with the real design to direct, control, counteract, or awe the regular deliberation and action of the constituted authorities, are destructive of this fundamental principle and of fatal tendency. They serve to organize faction; to give it an artificial and extraordinary force; to put in the place of the delegated will of the nation the will of a party, often a small but artful and enterprising minority of the community; and, according to the alternate triumphs of different parties, to make the public administration the mirror of the ill concerted and incongruous projects of faction, rather than the organ of consistent and wholesome plans digested by common councils and modified by mutual interests.` - [Washington’s Farewell Address to the People of the United States, 1796](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-CDOC-106sdoc21/pdf/GPO-CDOC-106sdoc21.pdf)
	    - `Towards the preservation of your government and the permanency of your present happy state, it is requisite not only that you steadily discountenance irregular oppositions to its acknowledged authority but also that you resist with care the spirit of innovation upon its principles, however specious the pretexts. One method of assault may be to effect in the forms of the Constitution alterations which will impair the energy of the system and thus to undermine what cannot be directly overthrown. In all the changes to which you may be invited, remember that time and habit are at least as necessary to fix the true character of governments as of other human institutions, that experience is the surest standard by which to test the real tendency of the existing constitution of a country, that facility in changes upon the credit of mere hypotheses and opinion exposes to perpetual change from the endless variety of hypotheses and opinion; and remember, especially, that for the efficient management of your common interests in a country so extensive as ours, a government of as much vigor as is consistent with the perfect security of liberty is indispensable; liberty itself will find in such a government, with powers properly distributed and adjusted, its surest guardian. It is indeed little else than a name, where the government is too feeble to withstand the enterprises of faction, to confine each member of the society within the limits prescribed by the laws, and to maintain all in the secure and tranquil enjoyment of the rights of person and property.` - [Washington’s Farewell Address to the People of the United States, 1796](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-CDOC-106sdoc21/pdf/GPO-CDOC-106sdoc21.pdf)
	    - `I have already intimated to you the danger of parties in the state, with particular reference to the founding of them on geographical discriminations. Let me now take a more comprehensive view and warn you in the most solemn manner against the baneful effects of the spirit of party, generally.`
	      
	      `This spirit, unfortunately, is inseparable from our nature, having its root in the strongest passions of the human mind. It exists under different shapes in all governments, more or less stifled, controlled, or repressed; but in those of the popular form it is seen in its greatest rankness and is truly their worst enemy.`
	      
	      `The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by the spirit of revenge natural to party dissension, which in different ages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is itself a frightful despotism. But this leads at length to a more formal and permanent despotism. The disorders and miseries which result gradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in the absolute power of an individual; and sooner or later the chief of some prevailing faction, more able or more fortunate than his competitors, turns this disposition to the purposes of his own elevation on the ruins of public liberty.` - [Washington’s Farewell Address to the People of the United States, 1796](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-CDOC-106sdoc21/pdf/GPO-CDOC-106sdoc21.pdf)
    
    - Chief Justice John Roberts, writing the majority opinion
        - The president has three broad types of immunity claims
            - "Core powers" that only the executive/president can perform.
                - Actions taken here are granted **absolute immunity.**
            - "Official powers" or "Overlapping powers" where the president OR some other branch could perform them.
                - Actions taken here are given **presumptive immunity**, meaning the burden is on the Government to prove that immunity should not be granted in this particular case, by proving that prosecuting a particular presidential act must pose "no dangers of intrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch."
            - "Unofficial" actions
                - Actions taken here are granted **no criminal immunity**, Roberts says that these actions must be "manifestly or palpably beyond [their] authority."
        - Any immunity granted for any actions also means those actions cannot be reviewed even if they were used in the furtherance of another crime.
        - Rulings on 4 major allegations brought up in the Opinion
            - Conversation between Trump and his Attorney General
                - The SC said this would be granted **absolute immunity**
            - Pressuring Pence to flip the electoral vote.
                - Granted **presumptive immunity**
            - Conversations with state officials to flip their electoral votes.
                - Remanded to the lower courts to argue about what kind of actions these were.
            - Speech made on January 6th to rally supporters to march on the capitol
                - Remanded to the lower courts to argue about what kind of actions these were
- Justice Thomas Concurring Opinion
    - `Few things would threaten our constitutional order more than criminally prosecuting a former President for his official acts. Fortunately, the Constitution does not permit us to chart such a dangerous course. As the Court forcefully explains, the Framers “deemed an energetic executive essential to . . . the security of liberty,” and our “system of separated powers” accordingly insulates the President from prosecution for his official acts.` - [Trump v. United States (Absolute Immunity SCOTUS Case), Supreme Court of the United States, 2024](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf)
	    - `There is an idea, which is not without its advocates, that a vigorous Executive is inconsistent with the genius of republican government. The enlightened well-wishers to this species of government must at least hope that the supposition is destitute of foundation; since they can never admit its truth, without at the same time admitting the condemnation of their own principles. Energy in the Executive is a leading character in the definition of good government. It is essential to the protection of the community against foreign attacks; it is not less essential to the steady administration of the laws; to the protection of property against those irregular and high-handed combinations which sometimes interrupt the ordinary course of justice; to the security of liberty against the enterprises and assaults of ambition, of faction, and of anarchy. Every man the least conversant in Roman story, knows how often that republic was obliged to take refuge in the absolute power of a single man, under the formidable title of Dictator, as well against the intrigues of ambitious individuals who aspired to the tyranny, and the seditions of whole classes of the community whose conduct threatened the existence of all government, as against the invasions of external enemies who menaced the conquest and destruction of Rome.`
	      
	      `There can be no need, however, to multiply arguments or examples on this head. A feeble Executive implies a feeble execution of the government. A feeble execution is but another phrase for a bad execution; and a government ill executed, whatever it may be in theory, must be, in practice, a bad government.` - [The Federalist Papers: No.70, Alexander Hamilton, 1788](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed70.asp)
	    - `But one of the weightiest objections to a plurality in the Executive, and which lies as much against the last as the first plan, is, that it tends to conceal faults and destroy responsibility. Responsibility is of two kinds to censure and to punishment. The first is the more important of the two, especially in an elective office. Man, in public trust, will much oftener act in such a manner as to render him unworthy of being any longer trusted, than in such a manner as to make him obnoxious to legal punishment. But the multiplication of the Executive adds to the difficulty of detection in either case. It often becomes impossible, amidst mutual accusations, to determine on whom the blame or the punishment of a pernicious measure, or series of pernicious measures, ought really to fall. It is shifted from one to another with so much dexterity, and under such plausible appearances, that the public opinion is left in suspense about the real author. The circumstances which may have led to any national miscarriage or misfortune are sometimes so complicated that, where there are a number of actors who may have had different degrees and kinds of agency, though we may clearly see upon the whole that there has been mismanagement, yet it may be impracticable to pronounce to whose account the evil which may have been incurred is truly chargeable. "I was overruled by my council. The council were so divided in their opinions that it was impossible to obtain any better resolution on the point.'' These and similar pretexts are constantly at hand, whether true or false. And who is there that will either take the trouble or incur the odium, of a strict scrunity into the secret springs of the transaction? Should there be found a citizen zealous enough to undertake the unpromising task, if there happen to be collusion between the parties concerned, how easy it is to clothe the circumstances with so much ambiguity, as to render it uncertain what was the precise conduct of any of those parties?` - [The Federalist Papers: No.70, Alexander Hamilton, 1788](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed70.asp)

      `For reasons I explain below, I do not join Part III–C of the Court’s opinion. The remainder of the opinion is consistent with my view that the Constitution prohibits Congress from criminalizing a President’s exercise of core Article II powers and closely related conduct. That said, I would have framed the underlying legal issues differently. The Court describes the President’s constitutional protection from certain prosecutions as an “immunity.” As I see it, that term is shorthand for two propositions: The President can challenge the constitutionality of a criminal statute as applied to official acts alleged in the indictment, and he can obtain interlocutory review of the trial court’s ruling.` - [Trump v. United States (Absolute Immunity SCOTUS Case), 2024](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf)
    - `If the statute covers the alleged official conduct, the prosecution may proceed only if applying it in the circumstances poses no “ ‘dange[r] of intrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch.’ ” Ante, at 14 (quoting Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 731, 754 (1982)). On remand, the lower courts will have to apply that standard to various allegations involving the President’s official conduct.` - [Trump v. United States (Absolute Immunity SCOTUS Case), Supreme Court of the United States, 2024](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf)
    - `This analysis is unnecessary for allegations involving the President’s private conduct because the Constitution offers no protection from prosecution of acts taken in a private capacity. Ante, at 15. Sorting private from official conduct sometimes will be difficult—but not always. Take the President’s alleged attempt to organize alternative slates of electors. See, e.g., App. 208. In my view, that conduct is private and therefore not entitled to protection. See post, at 27–28 (SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting). The Constitution vests power to appoint Presidential electors in the States. Art. II, §1, cl. 2; see also Chiafalo v. Washington, 591 U. S. 578, 588–589 (2020). And while Congress has a limited role in that process, see Art. II, §1, cls. 3–4, the President has none. In short, a President has no legal authority—and thus no official capacity—to influence how the States appoint their electors. I see no plausible argument for barring prosecution of that alleged conduct.` - [Trump v. United States (Absolute Immunity SCOTUS Case), Supreme Court of the United States, 2024](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf)
    - `The Constitution does not insulate Presidents from criminal liability for official acts. But any statute regulating the exercise of executive power is subject to a constitutional challenge. See, e.g., Collins v. Yellen, 594 U. S. 220, 235236 (2021); Zivotofsky v. Clinton, 566 U. S. 189, 192–194 (2012); Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd., 561 U. S. 477, 487–488 (2010). A criminal statute is no exception. Thus, a President facing prosecution may challenge the constitutionality of a criminal statute as applied to official acts alleged in the indictment. If that challenge fails, however, he must stand trial.` - [Trump v. United States (Absolute Immunity SCOTUS Case), Supreme Court of the United States, 2024](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf)
    - Amy Coney Barrett, concurring in part
        - Barrett disagrees that official acts can't be probed or presented as evidence in a criminal trial, even if those particular acts would ordinarily be immune from criminal prosecution.
        - Barrett also doesn't seem to agree with an "expansive" view on the absolute immunity argument forwarded by Roberts, but instead seems to view "official conduct" with a much more narrow lens, citing the conversations Trump has with election officials as falling squarely into private conduct, whereas Roberts remanded those questions to the lower courts.

    - `First, the Framers clearly knew how to provide for immunity from prosecution. They did provide a narrow immunity for legislators in the Speech or Debate Clause. See Art. I, §6, cl. 1 (“Senators and Representatives . . . shall in all Cases, except Treason, Felony and Breach of the Peace, be privileged from Arrest during their Attendance at the Session of their respective Houses, and in going to and returning from the same; and for any Speech or Debate in either House, they shall not be questioned in any other Place”). They did not extend the same or similar immunity to Presidents.`
      
      `Second, “some state constitutions at the time of the Framing specifically provided ‘express criminal immunities’ to sitting governors.” Brief for Scholars of Constitutional Law as Amici Curiae 4 (quoting S. Prakash, Prosecuting and Punishing Our Presidents, 100 Tex. L. Rev. 55, 69 (2021)). The Framers chose not to include similar language in the Constitution to immunize the President. If the Framers “had wanted to create some constitutional privilege to shield the President . . . from criminal indictment,” they could have done so. Memorandum from R. Rotunda to K. Starr re: Indictability of the President 18 (May 13, 1998). They did not.` - [Trump v.

    - `Third, insofar as the Constitution does speak to this question, it actually contemplates some form of criminal liability for former Presidents. The majority correctly rejects Trump’s argument that a former President cannot be prosecuted unless he has been impeached by the House and convicted by the Senate for the same conduct. See ante, at 32–34; Part IV–C, infra. The majority ignores, however, that the Impeachment Judgment Clause cuts against its own position. That Clause presumes the availability of criminal process as a backstop by establishing that an official impeached and convicted by the Senate “shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.” Art. I, §3, cl. 7 (emphasis added). That Clause clearly contemplates that a former President may be subject to criminal prosecution for the same conduct that resulted (or could have resulted) in an impeachment judgment—including conduct such as “Bribery,” Art. II, §4, which implicates official acts almost by definition.` - [Trump v. United States (Absolute Immunity SCOTUS Case), Supreme Court of the United States, 2024](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf)
    - `At the Constitutional Convention, James Madison, who was aware that some state constitutions provided governors immunity, proposed that the Convention “conside[r] what privileges ought to be allowed to the Executive.” 2 Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, p. 503 (M. Farrand ed. 1911). There is no record of any such discussion. Ibid. Delegate Charles Pinckney later explained that “[t]he Convention which formed the Constitution well knew” that “no subject had been more abused than privilege,” and so it “determined to . . . limi[t] privilege to what was necessary, and no more.” 3 id., at 385. “No privilege . . . was intended for [the] Executive.”` - [Trump v. United States (Absolute Immunity SCOTUS Case), Supreme Court of the United States, 2024](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf)
    - `To note, as the majority does, see ante, at 39, that this Court has recognized civil immunities arguably inconsistent with this view is not to say that Pinckney was wrong about what the Framers had “intended.” Indeed, Pinckney’s contemporaries shared the same view during the ratification debates. See, e.g., 4 Debates on the Constitution 109 (J. Elliot ed. 1836) (J. Iredell) (“If the President does a single act by which the people are prejudiced, he is punishable himself. . . . If he commits any crime, he is punishable by the laws of his country”).` - [Trump v. United States (Absolute Immunity SCOTUS Case), Supreme Court of the United States, 2024](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf)
	    - `No man has an authority to injure another with impunity. No man is better than his fellow-citizens, nor can pretend to any superiority over the meanest man in the country. If the President does a single act by which the people are prejudiced, he is punishable himself, and no other man merely to screen him. If he commits any misdemeanor in office, he is impeachable, removable from office, and incapacitated to hold any office of honor, trust, or profit. If he commits any crime, he is punishable by the laws of his country, and in capital cases may be deprived of his life. This being the case, there is not the same reason here for having a council which exists in England. It is, however, much to be desired, that a man who has such extensive and important business to perform should have the means of some assistance to enable him to discharge his arduous employment. The advice of the principal executive officers, which he can at all times command, will, in my opinion, answer this valuable purpose. He can at no time want advice, if he desires it, as the principal officers will always be on the spot. Those officers, from their abilities and experience, will probably be able to give as good, if not better, advice than any counsellors would do; and the solemnity of the advice in writing, which must be preserved, would be a great check upon them.` - [Debates on the Constitution 109, James Iredell, 1788](https://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a2_2_1s13.html)
    - `This historical evidence reinforces that, from the very beginning, the presumption in this Nation has always been that no man is free to flout the criminal law. The majority fails to recognize or grapple with the lack of historical evidence for its new immunity. With nothing on its side of the ledger, the most the majority can do is claim that the historical evidence is a wash. See ante, at 38–39. It claims that the Court previously has described the “relevant historical evidence on the question of Presidential immunity” as “ ‘fragmentary’” and not worthy of consideration. Ante, at 38 (quoting Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 752, n. 31). Yet the Court has described only the evidence regarding “the President’s immunity from damages liability” as “fragmentary.” Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 751–752, n. 31 (emphasis added). Moreover, far from dismissing that evidence as irrelevant, the Fitzgerald Court was careful to note that “[t]he best historical evidence clearly support[ed]” the immunity from damages liability that it recognized, and it relied in part on that historical evidence to overcome the lack of any textual basis for its immunity. Id., at 152, n. 31. The majority ignores this reliance. It seems history matters to this Court only when it is convenient. See, e.g., New York State Rifle & Pistol Assn., Inc. v. Bruen, 597 U. S. 1 (2022); Dobbs, 597 U. S. 215.` - [Trump v. United States (Absolute Immunity SCOTUS Case), Supreme Court of the United States, 2024](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf)
    - `Consider Watergate, for example. After the Watergate tapes revealed President Nixon’s misuse of official power to obstruct the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s investigation of the Watergate burglary, President Ford pardoned Nixon. Both Ford’s pardon and Nixon’s acceptance of the pardon necessarily “rested on the understanding that the former President faced potential criminal liability.” Brief for United States 15; see also Public Papers of the Presidents, Gerald R. Ford, Vol. 1, Sept. 8, 1974, p. 103 (1975) (granting former President Nixon a “full, free, and absolute pardon . . . for all offenses against the United States which he . . . has committed or may have committed or taken part in during” his Presidency); R. Nixon, Statement by Former President Richard Nixon to P. Buchen, Counsel to President Ford, p. 1 (Sept. 8, 1974) (accepting “full and absolute pardon for any charges which might be brought against me for actions taken during the time I was President of the United States”).` - [Trump v. United States (Absolute Immunity SCOTUS Case), Supreme Court of the United States, 2024](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf)
    - `Indeed, Trump’s own lawyers during his second impeachment trial assured Senators that declining to impeach Trump for his conduct related to January 6 would not leave him “in any way above the law.” 2 Proceedings of the U. S. Senate in the Impeachment Trial of Donald John Trump, S. Doc. 117–2, p. 144 (2021). They insisted that a former President “is like any other citizen and can be tried in a court of law.” Ibid.; see also 1 id., S. Doc. 117–3, at 339 (Trump’s impeachment counsel stating that “no former officeholder is immune” from the judicial process “for investigation, prosecution, and punishment”); id., at 322–323 (Trump’s impeachment counsel stating: “If my colleagues on this side of the Chamber actually think that President Trump committed a criminal offense . . . [a]fter he is out of office, you go and arrest him”). Now that Trump is facing criminal charges for those acts, though, the tune has changed. Being treated “like any other citizen” no longer seems so appealing.` - [Trump v. United States (Absolute Immunity SCOTUS Case), Supreme Court of the United States, 2024](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf)
    - `the majority announces that former Presidents are “absolute[ly],” or “at least . . . presumptive[ly],” immune from criminal prosecution for all of their official acts. Ante, at 14 (emphasis omitted). The majority purports to keep us in suspense as to whether this immunity is absolute or presumptive, but it quickly gives up the game. It explains that, “[a]t a minimum, the President must . . . be immune from prosecution for an official act unless the Government can show that applying a criminal prohibition to that act would pose no ‘dangers of intrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch.’ ” Ibid. (emphasis added). No dangers, none at all. It is hard to imagine a criminal prosecution for a President’s official acts that would pose no dangers of intrusion on Presidential authority in the majority’s eyes. Nor should that be the standard. Surely some intrusions on the Executive may be “justified by an overriding need to promote objectives within the constitutional authority of Congress.” Nixon v. Administrator of General Services, 433 U. S. 425, 443 (1977). Other intrusions may be justified by the “primary constitutional duty of the Judicial Branch to do justice in criminal prosecutions.” United States v. Nixon, 418 U. S. 683, 707 (1974). According to the majority, however, any incursion on Executive power is too much. When presumptive immunity is this conclusive, the majority’s indecision as to “whether [official-acts] immunity must be absolute” or whether, instead, “presumptive immunity is sufficient,” ante, at 6, hardly matters.` - [Trump v. United States (Absolute Immunity SCOTUS Case), Supreme Court of the United States, 2024](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf)
    - `Quick on the heels of announcing this astonishingly broad official-acts immunity, the majority assures us that a former President can still be prosecuted for “unofficial acts.” Ante, at 15. Of course he can. No one has questioned the ability to prosecute a former President for unofficial (otherwise known as private) acts. Even Trump did not claim immunity for such acts and, as the majority acknowledges, such an immunity would be impossible to square with Clinton v. Jones, 520 U. S. 681 (1997). See ante, at 15. This unremarkable proposition is no real limit on today’s decision. It does not hide the majority’s embrace of the most far-reaching view of Presidential immunity on offer.`
      
      `In fact, the majority’s dividing line between “official” and “unofficial” conduct narrows the conduct considered “unofficial” almost to a nullity. It says that whenever the President acts in a way that is “ ‘not manifestly or palpably beyond [his] authority,’ ” he is taking official action. Ante, at 17 (quoting Blassingame v. Trump, 87 F. 4th 1, 13 (CADC 2023)). It then goes a step further: “In dividing official from unofficial conduct, courts may not inquire into the President’s motives.” Ante, at 18. It is one thing to say that motive is irrelevant to questions regarding the scope of civil liability, but it is quite another to make it irrelevant to questions regarding criminal liability. Under that rule, any use of official power for any purpose, even the most corrupt purpose indicated by objective evidence of the most corrupt motives and intent, remains official and immune. Under the majority’s test, if it can be called a test, the category of Presidential action that can be deemed “unofficial” is destined to be vanishingly small.`
      
      `Ultimately, the majority pays lip service to the idea that “[t]he President, charged with enforcing federal criminal laws, is not above them,” ante, at 13–14, but it then proceeds to place former Presidents beyond the reach of the federal criminal laws for any abuse of official power.` - [Trump v. United States (Absolute Immunity SCOTUS Case), 2024](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf)
    - `In the context of a federal criminal prosecution of a former President, however, the danger to the functioning of the Executive Branch is much reduced. Further, as every member of the Fitzgerald Court acknowledged, see Part IVB–2, infra, the public interest in a criminal prosecution is far weightier. Applying the Fitzgerald balancing here should yield the opposite result. Instead, the majority elides any difference between civil and criminal immunity, granting Trump the same immunity from criminal prosecution that Nixon enjoyed from an unlawful termination suit. That is plainly wrong.` - [Trump v. United States (Absolute Immunity SCOTUS Case), Supreme Court of the United States, 2024](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf)
    - `Indeed, a former President is likely to have legal arguments that would be unavailable to the average criminal defendant. For example, he may be able to rely on a public-authority exception from particular criminal laws,3 or an advice-of-the-Attorney-General defense, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 107–108.4` - [Trump v. United States (Absolute Immunity SCOTUS Case), Supreme Court of the United States, 2024](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf)
    - `If the case nonetheless makes it to trial, the Government will bear the burden of proving every element of the alleged crime beyond a reasonable doubt to a unanimous jury of the former President’s fellow citizens. See United States v. Gaudin, 515 U. S. 506, 510 (1995). If the Government manages to overcome even that significant hurdle, then the former President can appeal his conviction, and the appellate review of his claims will be “ ‘particularly meticulous.’ ” Trump v. Vance, 591 U. S. 786, 809 (2020) (quoting Nixon, 418 U. S., at 702). He can ultimately seek this Court’s review, and if past practice (including in this case) is any indication, he will receive it.`
      
      `In light of these considerable protections, the majority’s fear that “ ‘bare allegations of malice,’ ” ante, at 18 (alteration omitted), would expose former Presidents to trial and conviction is unfounded. Bare allegations of malice would not make it out of the starting gate. Although a private civil action may be brought based on little more than “ ‘intense feelings,’ ” ante, at 11 (quoting Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 752), a federal criminal prosecution is made of firmer stuff. Certainly there has been, on occasion, great feelings of animosity between incoming and outgoing Presidents over the course of our country’s history. Yet it took allegations as grave as those at the center of this case to have the first federal criminal prosecution of a former President. That restraint is telling.`
      
      `Third, because of longstanding interpretations by the Executive Branch, every sitting President has so far believed himself under the threat of criminal liability after his term in office and nevertheless boldly fulfilled the duties of his office. The majority insists that the threat of criminal sanctions is “more likely to distort Presidential decisionmaking than the potential payment of civil damages.” Ante, at 13. If that is right, then that distortion has been shaping Presidential decisionmaking since the earliest days of the Republic. Although it makes sense to avoid “diversion of the President’s attention during the decisionmaking process” with “needless worry,” Clinton, 520 U. S., at 694, n. 19, one wonders why requiring some small amount of his attention (or his legal advisers’ attention) to go towards complying with federal criminal law is such a great burden. If the President follows the law that he must “take Care” to execute, Art. II, §3, he has not been rendered “ ‘unduly cautious,’ ” ante, at 10 (quoting Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 752, n. 32). Some amount of caution is necessary, after all. It is a far greater danger if the President feels empowered to violate federal criminal law, buoyed by the knowledge of future immunity. I am deeply troubled by the idea, inherent in the majority’s opinion, that our Nation loses something valuable when the President is forced to operate within the confines of federal criminal law.` - [Trump v.

    - Sonia Sotomayor, with whom Elena Kagan and Kentaji Jackson join, dissenting
        - Sotomayor argues in five parts
            - That the immunity is legally and historically inconsistent
                - Some state constitution actually did provide for criminal immunity for sitting governors, this was not included in the US Constitution.
                - Art I §3 C7 gives us the "_nevertheless_" for criminal prosecution, and things like bribery are official acts for which one can be impeached, so any citations of this part of the Constitution seem to imply that criminalizing official conduct was textually supported by the Constitution.
                - Sotomayor makes reference to other historical arguments that support the criminal charging of public officials acting in their official capacity.
            - That it is "deeply wrong"
            - That the "core" immunity is misguided and not needed
                - The difference between an official and unofficial act and the inability to probe motives or intents of anything that can be even slightly construed as an official act essentially nullifies almost all criminal law from applying to almost all presidential actions.
                - The civil vs criminal balancing test is not appropriately applied, since the public has a greater interest in criminal prosecution than it does in private suits, the executive branch should need to provide a greater reason, not a lesser one, to evade such liability.
            - The evidentiary holding is unprecedented
            - And that the ruling will have disastrous consequences
        - There are many more safeguards and protections built into criminal suits vs private action.
        - The court, even though it rejected Trump's arguments that impeachment must precede any criminal indictment, actually grants more immunity by claiming even actions by which a president is impeached for cannot be criminal charged.
        - Sotomayor challenges the logic that juries might be biased against a president's "official-acts" due to their bias against their administration, however, that same logic would likely extend to literally every single act of a president, including non-official acts for other private suits.
        - Roberts remanded 3 actions back to the lower courts for analysis, but for some reason thought it appropriate to declare the conversations Trump had with the AG as qualifying for absolute immunity with zero lower court consideration or analysis first.
        - She points out that Roberts goes further than what the defendants were even asking for, noting that even when they've conceded some acts as private, Roberts is saying they may not be.

    - Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, dissenting
        - Jackson points out the ludicrousness of the majority calling this a "Separation of Powers" question.
        - Says that majority claims that the president must commit crimes in order to do his job.
        - She points out that the Judges and Prosecutors themselves must assume a role of quasi-jury, judging whether a particular action was official or criminal in nature before any trial has even begun.
        - This ruling has allowed the court to snatch power from the Legislature and give it to the Court and the Executive, as they are now making determinations of who the law applies to.
        - "Core powers" aren't even very well defined in the Constitution.
