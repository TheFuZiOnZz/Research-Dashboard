- In March 2022, Trump filed a RICO lawsuit against Hillary Clinton, the Democratic National Committee, and dozens of Democrats, "alleging that they 'maliciously conspired to weave a false narrative that [Trump] was colluding with a hostile foreign sovereignty [Russia]' to try and rig the 2016 election." He demanded a jury trial and compensatory damages of at least $24 million.

- In September, US District Judge Donald M. Middlebrooks dismissed the suit, stating that it "ignored existing laws, U.S, Supreme Court precedent, and basic legal theory." The judge noted that Trump filed in the federal courthouse in Fort Pierce, Florida, whose only federal judge, district judge Aileen Cannon, is a Trump appointee. [link]
