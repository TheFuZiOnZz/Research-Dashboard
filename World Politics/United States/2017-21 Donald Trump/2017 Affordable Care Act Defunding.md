### 2017 Affordable Care Act Defunding
- The ACA is a multi payer system implemented under the Obama Administration, under the Trump Administration it was defunded. Trump has referred to the ACA as a `complete disaster` and has often offered solutions to healthcare with policy that sounds very similar to what the ACA proposes. [link](https://reason.com/2015/09/29/donald-trump-wants-to-repeal-obamacare-r/) Trump has also said he has `never supported socialized medicine.` [link](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2015/sep/11/reid-ribble/donald-trump-wants-replace-obamacare-single-payer-/) Trump has cited the rising costs of premiums and deductibles as a motivation to repeal the Affordable Care Act.
- However, according to a study by the Kaiser Family Foundation, the after-subsidy premium costs to those with insurance coverage via the Affordable Care Act's exchanges did not change significantly on average from 2016 to 2017, as increases in the subsidies offset pre-subsidy insurance premium increases. For example, after-subsidy costs for a popular `silver plan` remained around $200/month in 2016 and 2017 [link](https://www.kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/2017-premium-changes-and-insurer-participation-in-the-affordable-care-acts-health-insurance-marketplaces/)
- The Congressional Budget Office reported in March 2016 that there were approximately 23 million people with insurance due to the law, with 12 million people covered by the exchanges (10 million of whom received subsidies to help pay for insurance) and 11 million made eligible for Medicaid.

- The ACA major provisions came into force in 2014 and we saw a significant reduction in the number and percentage of people without health insurance after that. [link](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhis/earlyrelease/earlyrelease201611_01.pdf) In 2013, the U.S. had 44.8 million people uninsured, In 2014, the U.S. had 36.0 million people uninsured, In 2015, the U.S. had 28.6 million people uninsured.
- After the law went into effect, increases in overall healthcare spending slowed, including premiums for employer-based insurance plans. [link](http://files.kff.org/attachment/summary-of-findings-2015-employer-health-benefits-survey)
- Since 2016, the number of uninsured Americans has increased by roughly 1.4 million. In 2016, the U.S. had 27.5 million people uninsured. In 2017, the U.S. had 28.3 million people uninsured. In 2018, the U.S. had 28.9 million people uninsured. [link](https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2019-04/55094-CoverageUnder65_0.pdf)
- In 2026, an estimated 52 million people would be uninsured, compared with 28 million who would lack insurance that year under current law. Premiums would also increase by 15 to 20% in the next few years, although they would be 10% lower by 2026 [link](https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/115th-congress-2017-2018/costestimate/americanhealthcareact.pdf)
- On November 2, 2017, a bill later known as the [Tax Cuts and Jobs Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_Cuts_and_Jobs_Act) was introduced by Representative Kevin Brady of Texas. Included in the bill was the move to change the tax penalty for not having health insurance mandated by the Affordable Care Act to zero.[60](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efforts_to_repeal_the_Affordable_Care_Act#cite_note-:1-60) [61](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efforts_to_repeal_the_Affordable_Care_Act#cite_note-61) Economists said this would lower interest in obtaining health insurance coverage.[62](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efforts_to_repeal_the_Affordable_Care_Act#cite_note-62) The bill was signed into law on December 22, 2017 by Donald Trump,[63](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efforts_to_repeal_the_Affordable_Care_Act#cite_note-63) with the loss of individual mandate taxation being set to take effect January 1, 2019.[60](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efforts_to_repeal_the_Affordable_Care_Act#cite_note-:1-60)
- In the midst of a global pandemic with the presidential election just months away, the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court on June 25th to invalidate the Affordable Care Act, the landmark health care law that enabled millions of Americans to get insurance coverage and that remains in effect despite the pending legal challenge.

- Biden Is in support of `Build on the Affordable Care Act with a plan to insure more than an estimated 97% of Americans.` [link](https://joebiden.com/healthcare/)
- Biden Is in support of `Expanding coverage to low-income Americans. Access to affordable health insurance shouldn’t depend on your state’s politics. But today, state politics is getting in the way of coverage for millions of low-income Americans. Governors and state legislatures in 14 states have refused to take up the Affordable Care Act’s expansion of Medicaid eligibility, denying access to Medicaid for an estimated 4.9 million adults.` [link](https://joebiden.com/healthcare/)
- Biden Is in support of `Giving Americans a new choice, a public health insurance option like Medicare. If your insurance company isn’t doing right by you, you should have another, better choice. Whether you’re covered through your employer, buying your insurance on your own, or going without coverage altogether, the Biden Plan will give you the choice to purchase a public health insurance option like Medicare.` [link](https://joebiden.com/healthcare/)
