### 2020 Soleimani Airport airstrike
- On 3 January 2020, a United States drone strike near Baghdad International Airport targeted and killed Iranian major general Qasem Soleimani of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Adil Abdul-Mahdi, Prime Minister of Iraq, said he was scheduled to meet Soleimani on the day the attack happened, with the purpose of Soleimani's trip being that Soleimani was delivering Iran's response to a previous message from Saudi Arabia which Iraq had relayed.

- Biden accused Trump of “flat-out” lying about the justification for killing Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, an action that brought the U.S. and Iran to the brink of war. `Quite frankly, I think he’s flat-out lied about saying, the reason he made the strike [on Soleimani] was because our embassies were about to be bombed.` [link](https://thehill.com/policy/international/478311-biden-slams-trump-on-solemaini-strike-he-flat-out-lied)
