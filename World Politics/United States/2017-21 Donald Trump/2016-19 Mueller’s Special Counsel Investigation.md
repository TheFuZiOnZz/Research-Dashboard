- 
## GRU’s Persona `Guccifer 2.0`
- On 12 January 2017, `Guccifer 2.0` released a blog post stating that accusations of ties with the Russian Government were unfounded.
    - `I really hope you’ve missed me a lot. Though I see they didn’t let you forget my name. The U.S. intelligence agencies have published several reports of late claiming I have ties with Russia.`
      
      `I’d like to make it clear enough that these accusations are unfounded. I have totally no relation to the Russian government. I’d like to tell you once again I was acting in accordance with my personal political views and beliefs.`
      
      `The technical evidence contained in the reports doesn’t stand up to scrutiny. This is a crude fake.`
      
      `Any IT professional can see that a malware sample mentioned in the Joint Analysis Report was taken from the web and was commonly available. A lot of hackers use it. I think it was inserted in the report to make it look a bit more plausible.` - [Here i am again my Friends!, Guccifer 2.0, 2017](https://guccifer2.wordpress.com/2017/01/12/fake-evidence/)

    - `On June 9, 2016, senior representatives of the Trump Campaign met in Trump Tower with a Russian attorney expecting to receive derogatory information about Hillary Clinton from the Russian government. The meeting was proposed to Donald Trump Jr. in an email from Robert Goldstone, at the request of his then-client Emin Agalarov, the son of Russian real-estate developer Aras Agalarov. Goldstone relayed to Trump Jr. that the “Crown prosecutor of Russia... offered to provide the Trump Campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia” as part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.” Trump Jr. immediately responded that “if it’s what you say I love it,” and arranged the meeting through a series of emails and telephone calls.` - [Report On The Investigation Into Russian Interference In The 2016 Presidential Election, Department of Justice, 2019](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download)

# Papadopoulos’ Meets Mifsud About `dirt` on Clinton, Opening Crossfire Hurricane Investigation
- On 26 April 2016, Papadopoulos’ Meets Mifsud, Mifsud says they have thousands of Clinton’s emails, namely `dirt`.
    - `After a stop in Rome, Mifsud returned to England on April 25, 2016. The next day, Papadopoulos met Mifsud for breakfast at the Andaz Hotel (the same location as their last meeting). During that meeting, Mifsud told Papadopoulos that he had met with high-level Russian government officials during his recent trip to Moscow. Mifsud also said that, on the trip, he learned that the Russians had obtained “dirt” on candidate Hillary Clinton. As Papadopoulos later stated to the FBI, Mifsud said that the “dirt” was in the form of “emails of Clinton,” and that they “have thousands of emails.”` - [Report On The Investigation Into Russian Interference In The 2016 Presidential Election, Department of Justice, 2019](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download)
- On 6 May 2016, Papadopoulos’ relays this `dirt` to Alexander Downer, the Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom.
    - `On May 6, 2016, 10 days after that meeting with Mifsud, Papadopoulos suggested to a representative of a foreign government that the Trump Campaign had received indications from the Russian government that it could assist the Campaign through the anonymous release of information that would be damaging to Hillary Clinton.` - [Report On The Investigation Into Russian Interference In The 2016 Presidential Election, Department of Justice, 2019](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download)
    - `In late April, at a London hotel, Mr. Mifsud told Mr. Papadopoulos that he had just learned from high-level Russian officials in Moscow that the Russians had “dirt” on Mrs. Clinton in the form of “thousands of emails,” according to court documents. Although Russian hackers had been mining data from the Democratic National Committee’s computers for months, that information was not yet public. Even the committee itself did not know.`
      
      `Whether Mr. Papadopoulos shared that information with anyone else in the campaign is one of many unanswered questions. He was mostly in contact with the campaign over emails. The day after Mr. Mifsud’s revelation about the hacked emails, he told Mr. Miller in an email only that he had “interesting messages coming in from Moscow” about a possible trip. The emails obtained by The Times show no evidence that Mr. Papadopoulos discussed the stolen messages with the campaign.`
      
      `Not long after, however, he opened up to Mr. Downer, the Australian diplomat, about his contacts with the Russians. It is unclear whether Mr. Downer was fishing for that information that night in May 2016. The meeting at the bar came about because of a series of connections, beginning with an Israeli Embassy official who introduced Mr. Papadopoulos to another Australian diplomat in London.` - [How the Russia Inquiry Began: A Campaign Aide, Drinks and Talk of Political Dirt, The New York Times, 2017](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/30/us/politics/how-fbi-russia-investigation-began-george-papadopoulos.html)
- On 26 July 2016, The Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom tells the U.S. Government about this `dirt` after the emails are released publicly through WikiLeaks.
    - `This information is contained in the FBI case-opening document and related materials. The information is law-enforcement sensitive (LES) and must be treated accordingly in any external dissemination. The foreign government conveyed this information to the U.S. government on July 26, 2016, a few days after WikiLeaks’s release of Clinton-related emails. The FBI opened its investigation of potential coordination between Russia and the Trump Campaign a few days later based on the information.` - [Report On The Investigation Into Russian Interference In The 2016 Presidential Election, Department of Justice, 2019](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download)
- On 31 July 2016, The FBI opened the Crossfire Hurricane Investigation in response to Papadopoulos’ claim of damaging material on Clinton from the Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom.
    - `July 2016 was also the month WikiLeaks first released emails stolen by the GRU from the DNC. On July 22, 2016, WikiLeaks posted thousands of internal DNC documents revealing information about the Clinton Campaign. Within days, there was public reporting that U.S. intelligence agencies had “high confidence” that the Russian government was behind the theft of emails and documents from the DNC. And within a week of the release, a foreign government informed the FBI about its May 2016 interaction with Papadopoulos and his statement that the Russian government could assist the Trump Campaign. On July 31, 2016, based on the foreign government reporting, the FBI opened an investigation into potential coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign.` - [Report On The Investigation Into Russian Interference In The 2016 Presidential Election, Department of Justice, 2019](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download)
# Trump Campaign’s Response to Reports About Russian Support for Trump
- On 26 February 2016, Reuters reported Russian ties to Flynn.
    - `Donald Trump is receiving foreign policy advice from a former U.S. military intelligence chief who wants the United States to work more closely with Russia to resolve global security issues, according to three sources.`
      
      `The sources, former foreign policy officials in past administrations, said retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, who was chief of the Defense Intelligence Agency under President Barack Obama from 2012-2014, has been informally advising Trump.`
      
      `Trump, who is leading the Republican race to be the party’s presidential candidate in November’s election, said earlier this month that he would soon release a list of his foreign policy advisers, but has yet to do so. The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment about Flynn.`
      
      `Flynn declined to comment when asked by Reuters whether he is advising Trump. Asked to describe his views about ties with Russia, he referred Reuters to his public statements.` - [Trump being advised by ex-U.S. Lieutenant General who favours closer, Reuters, 2016](https://reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-trump-advisor-idUSKCN0VZ2ZB/)
- On 30 March 2016, Bloomberg reported Russian ties to Page.
    - `A globe-trotting American investment banker who's built a career on deals with Russia and its state-run gas company, Carter Page says his business has suffered directly from the U.S. economic sanctions imposed after Russia's escalating involvement in the Ukraine. When Donald Trump named him last week as one of his foreign-policy advisers, Page says his e-mail inbox filled up with positive notes from Russian contacts. “So many people who I know and have worked with have been so adversely affected by the sanctions policy,” Page said in a two-hour interview last week. “There's a lot of excitement in terms of the possibilities for creating a better situation.”` - [Trump Russia Adviser Carter Page Interview, Bloomberg, 2016](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-30/trump-russia-adviser-carter-page-interview)
- On 21 July 2016, LA Times reported Russian ties to Manafort.
    - `For decades, Republican doctrine has viewed Russia as a power to mistrust. But in Donald Trump’s GOP, Moscow’s sins seem to matter less. The platform written at the GOP convention in Cleveland this week eliminated references to arming Ukraine in its fight with Russia, which seized the Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and has supported separatists in eastern Ukraine.`
      
      `Many in the party’s foreign policy establishment are outraged.`
      
      `They note that Trump’s campaign manager, Paul Manafort, had worked as a consultant for the now-ousted pro-Russian government in Ukraine.`
      
      `Trump’s investments in hotels, golf courses and other business interests overseas already have raised concerns of potential conflicts of interest with U.S. policy if he is elected.` - [In a shift, Republican platform doesn't call for arming Ukraine against Russia, spurring outrage, Los Angeles Times, 2016](https://www.latimes.com/world/la-na-pol-ukraine-gop-20160720-snap-story.html)
- On 27 July 2016, Trump during a campaign trail Press Conference, claimed that the Russia ties claims were a total deflection and that that closest he came to Russia was possible buying property’s, which was false as there were plans to make a Trump Tower Moscow discussed between September 2015 and June 2016.
    - `In a press conference the next day, July 27, 2016, Trump characterized “this whole thing with Russia” as “a total deflection” and stated that it was “farfetched” and “ridiculous.” Trump said that the assertion that Russia had hacked the emails was unproven, but stated that it would give him “no pause” if Russia had Clinton’s emails. Trump added, “Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.” Trump also said that “there’s nothing that I can think of that I’d rather do than have Russia friendly as opposed to the way they are right now,” and in response to a question about whether he would recognize Crimea as Russian territory and consider lifting sanctions, Trump replied, “We’ll be looking at that. Yeah, we’ll be looking.”`
      
      `During the press conference, Trump repeated “I have nothing to do with Russia” five times. He stated that “the closest [he] came to Russia” was that Russians may have purchased a home or condos from him. He said that after he held the Miss Universe pageant in Moscow in 2013 he had been interested in working with Russian companies that “wanted to put a lot of money into developments in Russia” but “it never worked out.” He explained, “[f]rankly, I didn’t want to do it for a couple of different reasons. But we had a major developer . . . that wanted to develop property in Moscow and other places. But we decided not to do it.” The Trump Organization, however, had been pursuing a building project in Moscow—the Trump Tower Moscow project— from approximately September 2015 through June 2016, and the candidate was regularly updated on developments, including possible trips by Michael Cohen to Moscow to promote the deal and by Trump himself to finalize it.` - [Report On The Investigation Into Russian Interference In The 2016 Presidential Election, Department of Justice, 2019](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download)
- On 19 August 2016, Manafort was asked to resign from the Trump Campaign because of the media coverage of his ties to Russia.
    - `On August 19, 2016, Manafort was asked to resign amid media coverage scrutinizing his ties to a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine and links to, Russian business.` - [Report On The Investigation Into Russian Interference In The 2016 Presidential Election, Department of Justice, 2019](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download)
    - `The Post's Robert Costa, Dan Balz and Jose A. DelReal have reported that Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort's resignation this morning was expected, following some campaign staff changes earlier in the week.`
      
      `But that wasn't the only news that preceded his exit. There were also a wave of fresh headlines dealing with investigations into his ties to a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine. Trump has come under fire from Democrats and Republicans with his friendly overtures to Russia — a country his party's 2012 nominee, Mitt Romney, called America's "No. 1 geopolitical foe." The recent revelations about Manafort's work in that part of the world did nothing to dismiss the image of a Trump campaign closer to Russia than many foreign policy experts were comfortable with.` - [Paul Manafort’s complicated ties to Ukraine, explained, The Washington Post, 2016](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/08/19/paul-manaforts-complicated-ties-to-ukraine-explained/)
- On 23 September 2016, Page was terminated from the Trump Campaign because of the media coverage of his ties to Russia.
    - `And when the media published stories about Page’s connections to Russia in September 2016, Trump Campaign officials terminated Page’s association with the Campaign and told the press that he had played “no role” in the Campaign.` - [Report On The Investigation Into Russian Interference In The 2016 Presidential Election, Department of Justice, 2019](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download)
    - `U.S. intelligence officials are seeking to determine whether an American businessman identified by Donald Trump as one of his foreign policy advisers has opened up private communications with senior Russian officials — including talks about the possible lifting of economic sanctions if the Republican nominee becomes president, according to multiple sources who have been briefed on the issue.`
      
      `The activities of Trump adviser Carter Page, who has extensive business interests in Russia, have been discussed with senior members of Congress during recent briefings about suspected efforts by Moscow to influence the presidential election, the sources said. After one of those briefings, Senate minority leader Harry Reid wrote FBI Director James Comey, citing reports of meetings between a Trump adviser (a reference to Page) and “high ranking sanctioned individuals” in Moscow over the summer as evidence of “significant and disturbing ties” between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin that needed to be investigated by the bureau.` - [U.S. intel officials probe ties between Trump adviser and Kremlin, Yahoo News, 2016](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/u-s-intel-officials-probe-ties-between-trump-adviser-and-kremlin-175046002.html?guccounter=1)
# Intelligence Community Report
- On 6 January 2017, The Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a report on `Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections`. The report includes an assessment by the National Security Agency, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation of the type and breadth of actions undertaken by Russia and affiliated elements during the 2016 elections.
    - `We assess with high confidence that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election, the consistent goals of which were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump. When it appeared to Moscow that Secretary Clinton was likely to win the election, the Russian influence campaign then focused on undermining her expected presidency.` - [Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections, Office of the Director of National Intellignence, 2017](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf)
    - `Moscow’s use of disclosures during the US election was unprecedented, but its influence campaign otherwise followed a longstanding Russian messaging strategy that blends covert intelligence operations—such as cyber activity—with overt efforts by Russian Government agencies, state-funded media, third-party intermediaries, and paid social media users or “trolls.”` - [Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections, Office of the Director of National Intellignence, 2017](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf)
    - `Russia’s intelligence services conducted cyber operations against targets associated with the 2016 US presidential election, including targets associated with both major US political parties.`
      
      `We assess Russian intelligence services collected against the US primary campaigns, think tanks, and lobbying groups they viewed as likely to shape future US policies. In July 2015, Russian intelligence gained access to Democratic National Committee (DNC) networks and maintained that access until at least June 2016.`  - [Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections, Office of the Director of National Intellignence, 2017](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf)
    - `We assess with high confidence that the GRU used the Guccifer 2.0 persona, DCLeaks.com, and WikiLeaks to release US victim data obtained in cyber operations publicly and in exclusives to media outlets.` - [Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections, Office of the Director of National Intellignence, 2017](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf)
    - `We assess with high confidence that the GRU relayed material it acquired from the DNC and senior Democratic officials to WikiLeaks. Moscow most likely chose WikiLeaks because of its self-proclaimed reputation for authenticity. Disclosures through WikiLeaks did not contain any evident forgeries.` - [Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections, Office of the Director of National Intellignence, 2017](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf)
    - `Russia’s state-run propaganda machine—comprised of its domestic media apparatus, outlets targeting global audiences such as RT and Sputnik, and a network of quasi-government trolls—contributed to the influence campaign by serving as a platform for Kremlin messaging to Russian and international audiences. State-owned Russian media made increasingly favorable comments about President-elect Trump as the 2016 US and primary election campaigns progressed while consistently offering negative coverage of Secretary Clinton.` - [Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections, Office of the Director of National Intellignence, 2017](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf)
    - `Russia’s effort to influence the 2016 US presidential election represented a significant escalation in directness, level of activity, and scope of effort compared to previous operations aimed at US elections. We assess the 2016 influence campaign reflected the Kremlin’s recognition of the worldwide effects that mass disclosures of US Government and other private data—such as those conducted by WikiLeaks and others—have achieved in recent years, and their understanding of the value of orchestrating such disclosures to maximize the impact of compromising information.` - [Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections, Office of the Director of National Intellignence, 2017](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf)
    - `We assess Moscow will apply lessons learned from its campaign aimed at the US presidential election to future influence efforts in the United States and worldwide, including against US allies and their election processes. We assess the Russian intelligence services would have seen their election influence campaign as at least a qualified success because of their perceived ability to impact public discussion.` - [Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections, Office of the Director of National Intellignence, 2017](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf)

LMK how to proceed.” Kushner responded in relevant part, “I think I do this one -- confirm with Dimitri [Simes of CNI] that this is the right guy.” After reaching out to a colleague of Simes at CNI, Vargas reported back to Kushner that Kislyak was “the best go-to guy for routine matters in the US,” while Yuri Ushakov, a Russian foreign policy advisor, was the contact for “more direct/substantial matters.”` - [Report On The Investigation Into Russian Interference In The 2016 Presidential Election, Department of Justice, 2019](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download)

I understand all that and I understand that the information that they have and all that. But I ask Russia to do is to not, if anything, I know you have to have some sort of action, to only make it reciprocal; don't go any further than you have to because I don't want us to get into something that have to escalate to tit-for-tat. Do you follow me?`
      
      `Kislyak says he understands what Flynn is saying, but Flynn might appreciate the sentiments that are raging now in Moscow.`

      `FLYNN: I know, I believe me, I do appreciate it, I very much appreciate it. But I really don't want us to get into a situation where we're going, you know. where we do this and then you do something bigger, and then you know, everybody's got to go back and forth and everybody's got to be the tough guy here, you know?`

      `KISLYAK: We agree.`
      
      `FLYNN: We have to eliminate this common threat.`
      
      `KISLYAK: We agree. One of the problems among the measures that have been announced today is that now FSB and GRU are sanctions, are sanctioned, and I ask myself, uh, does it mean that the United States isn't willing to work on terrorist threats?`
      
      `FLYNN: Yeah, yeah.`
      
      `KISLYAK: Because that's the people who are exactly, uh, fighting the terrorists.`

- On 12 January 2017, Flynn Makes False Public Statements About his Communications with Kislyak to Incoming Administration Officials, the Media, and the FBI.
    - `On January 12, 2017, a Washington Post columnist reported that Flynn and Kislyak communicated on the day the Obama Administration announced the Russia sanctions. The column questioned whether Flynn had said something to “undercut the U.S. sanctions” and whether Flynn’s communications had violated the letter or spirit of the Logan Act.`
      
      `President-Elect Trump called Priebus after the story was published and expressed anger about it. Priebus recalled that the President-Elect asked, “What the hell is this all about?” Priebus called Flynn and told him that the President-Elect was angry about the reporting on Flynn’s conversations with Kislyak. Flynn recalled that he felt a lot of pressure because Priebus had spoken to the “boss” and said Flynn needed to “kill the story.” Flynn directed McFarland to call the Washington Post columnist and inform him that no discussion of sanctions had occurred. McFarland recalled that Flynn said words to the effect of, “I want to kill the story.” McFarland made the call as Flynn had requested although she knew she was providing false information, and the Washington Post updated the column to reflect that a “Trump official” had denied that Flynn and Kislyak discussed sanctions.`
      
      `When Priebus and other incoming Administration officials questioned Flynn internally about the Washington Post column, Flynn maintained that he had not discussed sanctions with Kislyak. Flynn repeated that claim to Vice President-Elect Michael Pence and to incoming press secretary Sean Spicer. In subsequent media interviews in mid-January, Pence, Priebus, and Spicer denied that Flynn and Kislyak had discussed sanctions, basing those denials on their conversations with Flynn.` - [Report On The Investigation Into Russian Interference In The 2016 Presidential Election, Department of Justice, 2019](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download)
- On 12 January 2017, Trump reacted angrily to the article by The Washington Post. Trump’s incoming chief-of-staff, Reince Priebus, told Flynn of this, stating: "Kill the story". Flynn instructed aide McFarland to lie to The Washington Post that Flynn had not discussed the sanctions with Kislyak on December 29. McFarland knew this was false, but followed Flynn's instructions.

- On 12 January 2017, The Washington Post reported the denial of the contents of Flynn’s call with Kislyak.
    - `The Trump transition team did not respond Thursday night to a request for comment. But two team members called with information Friday morning. A first Trump official confirmed that Flynn had spoken with Kislyak by phone, but said the calls were before sanctions were announced and didn’t cover that topic. This official later added that Flynn’s initial call was to express condolences to Kislyak after the terrorist killing of the Russian ambassador to Ankara Dec. 19, and that Flynn made a second call Dec. 28 to express condolences for the shoot-down of a Russian plane carrying a choir to Syria. In that second call, Flynn also discussed plans for a Trump-Putin conversation sometime after the inauguration. In addition, a second Trump official said the Dec. 28 call included an invitation from Kislyak for a Trump administration official to visit Kazakhstan for a conference in late January.` - [Why did Obama dawdle on Russia’s hacking?, The Washington Post, 2017](https://archive.ph/CGhKS)
- On 22 January 2017, The Wall Street Journal reported that Flynn was under investigation by U.S. counterintelligence agents for his communications with Russian officials.
    - `U.S. counterintelligence agents have investigated communications that President Donald Trump’s national security adviser had with Russian officials, according to people familiar with the matter.`
      
      `Michael Flynn is the first person inside the White House under Mr. Trump whose communications are known to have faced scrutiny as part of investigations by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Central Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency and Treasury Department to determine the extent of Russian government contacts with people close to Mr. Trump.`
      
      `It isn’t clear when the counterintelligence inquiry began, whether it produced any incriminating evidence or if it is continuing. Mr. Flynn, a retired general who became national security adviser with Mr. Trump’s inauguration, plays a key role in setting U.S. policy toward Russia.` - [U.S. Eyes Michael Flynn’s Links to Russia, The Wall Street Journal, 2017](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-eyes-michael-flynns-links-to-russia-1485134942)
- On 13 February 2017, Flynn resigned as National Security Advisor, writing that he had given "incomplete information" of his conversations with Kislyak.
    - `In the course of my duties as the incoming National Security Advisor, I held numerous phone calls with foreign counterparts, ministers, and ambassadors. These calls were to facilitate a smooth transition and begin to build the necessary relationships between the President, his advisors and foreign leaders. Such calls are standard practice in any transition of this magnitude.  
    -   
    - Unfortunately, because of the fast pace of events, I inadvertently briefed the Vice President Elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian Ambassador. I have sincerely apologized to the President and the Vice President, and they have accepted apology.  
    -   
    - Throughout my over thirty three years of honorable military service, and my tenure as the National Security Advisor, I have always performed my duties with the upmost of integrity and honesty to those I have served, to include the President of the United States.

- On 14 February 2017, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said that Trump had asked for Flynn to resign, "not based on a legal issue, but based on a trust issue", due to "misleading the Vice President and others, or the possibility that he had forgotten critical details of this important conversation", which "created a critical mass and an unsustainable situation".
    
    - `Q: No — the other question is, just getting back to what was asked a few moments ago about trust and being misled. Are you saying that the national security advisor was intentionally misleading the President, the Vice President, yourself when he made these comments to you about that conversation?  
    -   
    - MR. SPICER: No, look, the trust is given by the President. It’s a relationship between he and any individual. And so, as I mentioned in the comments, maybe it was because — I don’t know that it was intentional, he may have just forgotten, but I think at some point trust isn’t just —  
    -   
    - Q: Isn’t that kind of a weird thing to forget, though, in a conversation where you talk about —  
    -   
    - MR. SPICER: But that’s the point, Jim, is that at some point that trust eroded to a point where the President did not feel comfortable with him serving in that position, and asked for and received his resignation.`

- On 15 February 2017, Flynn was Interviewed in a Deposition to the FBI, in which he said he didn’t ask Kislyak about escalation from Russia because of the sanctions end expelling of diplomats.
    
    - `The interviewing agents asked FLYNN if he recalled any with KISLYAK in which the expulsions were discussed, where FLYNN might have encouraged KISLYAK not to escalate the situation, to keep the Russian response reciprocal, or not to engage in a "tit—for—tat. t'  
    - FLYNN responded, "Not really. I don't It wasn't, t Don't do anything. remember. The U.S. Government 's response was a total surprise to FLYNN. FLYNN did not know about the Persona Non—Grata (PNG) action until it was in the media. KISLYAK and FLYNN were starting off on a good footing and FLYNN was looking forward to the relationship. With regard to the scope of the Russians who were expelled, FLYNN said he did not understand it. FLYNN stated he could understand one PNG, but not thirty—five.` - Flynn FBI Interview Report

- On 5 November 2017, NBC News reported that Robert Mueller had enough evidence for charges against Flynn and his son, Michael G. Flynn.
    
    - `Federal investigators have gathered enough evidence to bring charges in their investigation of President Donald Trump's former national security adviser and his son as part of the probe into Russia's intervention in the 2016 election, according to multiple sources familiar with the investigation.  
    -   
    - Michael T. Flynn, who was fired after just 24 days on the job, was one of the first Trump associates to come under scrutiny in the federal probe now led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller into possible collusion between Moscow and the Trump campaign.  
    -   
    - Mueller is applying renewed pressure on Flynn following his indictment of Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, three sources familiar with the investigation told NBC News.  
    -   
    - The investigators are speaking to multiple witnesses in coming days to gain more information surrounding Flynn's lobbying work, including whether he laundered money or lied to federal agents about his overseas contacts, according to three sources familiar with the investigation.`

- On 1 December 2017, Flynn and special counsel Robert Mueller agreed to a plea bargain in the District of Columbia's U.S. District Court. In the agreement, Flynn pleaded guilty to "willfully and knowingly" making "false, fictitious and fraudulent statements" to the FBI regarding conversations with Russia's ambassador.
    
    - `Michael Flynn, President Donald Trump’s former national security adviser, pleaded guilty Friday to lying to the FBI about his postelection contacts with Russia’s ambassador to the United States — and is now cooperating with a probe into links between the Trump campaign and Russia.  
    -   
    - Flynn surrendered Friday morning before a hearing in Washington federal court, where he admitted guilty to a single criminal count of knowingly making materially false, fictitious and fraudulent statements to FBI agents.  
    -   
    - That charge against the retired Army lieutentant general was lodged by prosecutors for special counsel Robert Mueller, who is probing alleged connections between the Trump presidential campaign with Russians.  
    -   
    - Mueller’s office in a court filing said “Flynn’s false statements and omissions impeded and otherwise had a material impact on the FBI’s ongoing investigation into the existence of any links or coordination between individuals associated with the Campaign and Russia’s effort to interfere with the 2016 presidential election.”`  
    - [[courtschedu]]
    
    - `President Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, pleaded guilty on Friday to lying to the F.B.I. about conversations with the Russian ambassador last December, becoming the first senior White House official to cut a cooperation deal in the special counsel’s wide-ranging inquiry into election interference.  
    -   
    - Mr. Flynn’s discussions with Sergey I. Kislyak, the Russian ambassador, were part of a coordinated effort by Mr. Trump’s aides to create foreign policy before they were in power, documents released as part of Mr. Flynn’s plea agreement show. Their efforts undermined the existing policy of President Barack Obama and flouted a warning from a senior Obama administration official to stop meddling in foreign affairs before the inauguration.  
    -   
    - The documents do not disclose what Mr. Trump knew about Mr. Flynn’s discussions. But in at least one instance, prosecutors say, Mr. Flynn was directed by a “very senior member” of the presidential transition team to discuss a United Nations resolution. Mr. Trump’s lawyers believe that unnamed aide was Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and close adviser, Jared Kushner, according to a lawyer briefed on the matter.`

- On 2 December 2017, President Trump stated that he "had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI", noting that Flynn had "pled guilty to those lies".
    
    - `President Donald Trump in a tweet on Saturday said he fired his former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn because Flynn lied to the vice president — and the FBI.  
    -   
    - If that is indeed the case, that means Trump knew that Flynn had lied to the FBI when he asked FBI Director James Comey to drop his inquiry into Flynn and then fired Comey when he failed to do so.  
    -   
    - “I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI,” Trump said in a midday tweet. “He has pled guilty to those lies. It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful. There was nothing to hide!”`

- On 21 December 2017, Pence stated to CBS News that by the time Flynn departed the Trump administration, "I knew that he lied to me". Pence also said that Trump "made the right decision" to remove Flynn.
    
    - `Vice President Mike Pence told CBS News' Margaret Brennan Thursday that he knew former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn had lied to him about his contacts with the Russians when Flynn was fired in February. Brennan spoke with Pence during the vice president's surprise trip to Afghanistan.  
    -   
    - Flynn, who's now cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller's probe of Russian election interference, pled guilty last month to lying to the FBI. He told investigators he'd never discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia with a Russian ambassador when those sanctions were imposed by the Obama administration shortly after the 2016 election.  
    -   
    - Before Flynn's claim was publicly revealed as a lie, however, it was repeated by Pence during a January 15 interview with Face the Nation moderator John Dickerson. Pence said he'd spoken with Flynn about his Christmas Day interaction with a Russian envoy. "He had sent a text to the Russian ambassador to express not only Christmas wishes but sympathy for the loss of life in the airplane crash that took place," Pence said. "It was strictly coincidental that they had a conversation. They did not discuss anything having to do with the United States' decision to expel diplomats or impose censure against Russia."

# Steele Dossier & it Becoming Public
- The Steele Dossier is a unfinished 35-page political opposition research report of raw intelligence written from June to December 2016 based on information from initially anonymous sources known to the author, counterintelligence specialist, Christopher Steele, a former head of the Russia Desk for British intelligence (MI6), containing allegations of misconduct, conspiracy, and cooperation between Donald Trump's presidential campaign and the government of Russia prior to and during the 2016 election campaign.
- On 19 September 2016, Steele's FBI handling agent sent six of Steele's reports (80, 94, 95, 100, 101, and 102) to the Crossfire Hurricane team, 3 months after the investigation started. This was the first time they and their leader, Deputy Assistant Director of the FBI's Counterespionage Section, Peter Strzok, received any of Steele's reporting.
    
    - `On September 19, 2016, the Crossfire Hurricane team received the Steele reporting for the first time when Handling Agent 1 emailed SSA 1 six reports for SSA 1 to upload himself to the sub-file: Reports 80 and 94, and four additional reports (Reports 95, 100, 101, and 102) that Handling Agent 1 had since received from Steele. 226 FBI officials we interviewed told us that the length of time it took for Steele's election reporting to reach FBI Headquarters was excessive and that the reports should have been sent promptly after their receipt by the Legat. Members of the Crossfire Hurricane team told us that their assessment of the Steele election reporting could have started much earlier if the reporting had been made available to them.` - Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation [link](https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf)
    
    - `After obtaining the six Steele reports on September 19, analysts on the Crossfire Hurricane team immediately began to evaluate the information in the reports. By the next day, they had completed a draft Intelligence Memorandum that summarized key points from the reports and identified actions that needed to be taken to assess the information.` - Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation [link](https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf)

The Dossier included claims of the possible real estate deals declined by Trump, which was later corroborated by the Mueller Report and an alleged the existence secret dossier complied by Russians involving `perverted sexual acts`, a claim uncorroborated.
    
    - `A dossier making explosive — but unverified — allegations that the Russian government has been “cultivating, supporting and assisting” President-elect Donald Trump for years and gained compromising information about him has been circulating among elected officials, intelligence agents, and journalists for weeks.

    - A dossier of compromising material on Hillary CLINTON has been collated by the Russian Intelligence Services over many years and mainly comprises bugged conversations she had on various visits to Russia and intercepted phone calls rather than any embarrassing conduct.

    - `Classified documents presented last week to President Obama and President-elect Trump included allegations that Russian operatives claim to have compromising personal and financial information about Mr. Trump, multiple US officials with direct knowledge of the briefings tell CNN.  
    -   
    - The allegations were presented in a two-page synopsis that was appended to a report on Russian interference in the 2016 election. The allegations came, in part, from memos compiled by a former British intelligence operative, whose past work US intelligence officials consider credible. The FBI is investigating the credibility and accuracy of these allegations, which are based primarily on information from Russian sources, but has not confirmed many essential details in the memos about Mr. Trump.  
    -   
    - The classified briefings last week were presented by four of the senior-most US intelligence chiefs – Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, FBI Director James Comey, CIA Director John Brennan, and NSA Director Admiral Mike Rogers.`

- On 11 January 2017, Trump during a Press Conference said that the dossier was a disgrace and claimed to have no dealings with Russia due to it being a conflict of interest.
    
    - `In a press conference the next day, the President-Elect called the release “an absolute disgrace” and said, “I have no dealings with Russia. I have no deals that could happen in Russia, because we’ve stayed away. . . . So I have no deals, I have no loans and I have no dealings. We could make deals in Russia very easily if we wanted to, I just don’t want to because I think that would be a conflict.”` - [Report On The Investigation Into Russian Interference In The 2016 Presidential Election, Department of Justice, 2019](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download)
    
- On 23 July 2018, Trump tweeted that the Steele Dossier was the reason the Special Counsel investigation began, which was untrue.
    
    - `So we now find out that it was indeed the unverified and Fake Dirty Dossier, that was paid for by Crooked Hillary Clinton and the DNC, that was knowingly & falsely submitted to FISA and which was responsible for starting the totally conflicted and discredited Mueller Witch Hunt!` [link](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1021341698734030848?s=20)
    
- On 9 December 2019, the Office of the Inspector General released a redacted report which mentioned that Steele's reporting wasn't taken at face value, and at every attempt the FBI would verify the sources of any claims. The report notes that the Office of the Inspector General asked the Crossfire Hurricane team if they were concerned about the financial source of the research provided to the FBI. The team replied that it was not a concern for the analysts.
    
    - `Assistant Director (AD) E.W. "Bill" Priestap and then Deputy Assistant Director (DAD) Peter Strzok told the OIG that the FBl's assessment of Steele's information was not different from the approach the FBI typically uses in evaluating CHS information. They explained that the assessment involved determining the credibility of Steele, including understanding his record of furnishing reliable information, motivation, and possible biases; and verifying the information he provided through independent sources. Priestap described the FBI's approach to the reporting in the following terms:  
    -   
    - [W]e did not ever take the information he provided at face value .... We went to great lengths to try to independently verify the source's credibility and to prove or disprove every single assertion in the dossier.... We absolutely understood that the information in the socalled dossier could be inaccurate. We also understood that some parts could be true and other parts false. We understood that information could be embellished or exaggerated. We also understood that the information could have been provided by the Russians as part of a disinformation campaign.  
    -   
    - The Supervisory Intelligence Analyst (Supervisory Intel Analyst) assigned to Crossfire Hurricane told the OIG that an early focus of the FBI's analytical effort to assess Steele's reporting was trying to identify Steele's sources. According to the Supervisory Intel Analyst, it was important to determine whether the reporting of those individuals matched their access to information. The Supervisory Intel Analyst said that, in order to evaluate that issue and fully assess the reporting, the FBI sought assistance from other USIC agencies by, for example, vetting Russian names identified in the reports.  
    -   
    - We asked the Supervisory Intel Analyst whether the FBI sought to determine who was financing Steele's election related research. He said that the focus of the analysts was on Russian interference in the campaign and on any connections between Russia and the Trump campaign. He stated that he was aware of the potential for political influences on the reporting. He said that, because of that awareness, whether the reporting was "opposition research" that was politically motivated was not an issue that occupied his or his analysts' attention and that further research on the issue was nearly "immaterial." He explained that because "opposition research can be true, it can be false," his focus was on vetting the reporting to determine whether its contents were accurate.` - Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation

    - `That weekend, Sessions and McGahn flew to Mar-a-Lago to meet with the President. Sessions recalled that the President pulled him aside to speak to him alone and suggested that Sessions should “unrecuse” from the Russia investigation. The President contrasted Sessions with Attorneys General Holder and Kennedy, who had developed a strategy to help their presidents where Sessions had not. Sessions said he had the impression that the President feared that the investigation could spin out of control and disrupt his ability to govern, which Sessions could have helped avert if he were still overseeing it.` - [Report On The Investigation Into Russian Interference In The 2016 Presidential Election, Department of Justice, 2019](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download)
    
# Trump Firing Comey, Starting Mueller’s Investigation
- On 26 April - 2 May 2017, Trump told advisors that he wanted Comey to make public that Trump was not under investigation at Comey’s upcoming hearing and if not that this would be Comey’s final straw.
    
    - `McGahn recalled that in the week leading up to the hearing the President said that it would be the last straw if Comey did not take the opportunity to set the record straight by publicly announcing that the President was not under investigation. The President  
    - had previously told McGahn that the perception that the President was under investigation was hurting his ability to carry out his presidential duties and deal with foreign leaders.` - Mueller Report

- On 3 May 2017, Comey testifies at an annual FBI Oversight hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, in which he was asked whether Trump was under investigation.
    
    - `At the hearing, Comey declined to answer questions about the status of the Russia investigation, stating “[t]he Department of Justice ha[d] authorized [him] to confirm that [the Russia investigation] exists,” but that he was “not going to say another word about it” until the investigation was completed. Comey also declined to answer questions about whether investigators had “ruled out anyone in the Trump campaign as potentially a target of th[e] criminal investigation,” including whether the FBI had “ruled out the president of the United States.”` - [Report On The Investigation Into Russian Interference In The 2016 Presidential Election, Department of Justice, 2019](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download)
    
    - `Sen. Blumenthal: You have confirmed, I believe, that the FBI is investigating potential ties between Trump associates and the Russian interference in the 2016 campaign, correct?  
    -   
    - Dir. Comey: Yes.  
    -   
    - Sen. Blumenthal: And you have not, to my knowledge, ruled out anyone in the Trump campaign as potentially a target of that criminal investigation, correct?  
    -   
    - Dir. Comey: I haven‘t said anything publicly about who we have opened investigations on. I briefed the chair and ranking on who the people are. I can't go beyond that in this setting.  
    -   
    - Sen. Blumenthal: Have you ruled out anyone in the campaign that you can disclose?  
    -   
    - Dir. Comey: I don't feel comfortable answering that, senator, because I think it puts me on a slope to talk about who we are investigating.  
    -   
    - Sen. Blumenthal: Have you ruled out the president of the United States?  
    -   
    - Dir. Comey: I don‘t want people to overinterpret this answer. I'm not going to comment on anyone in particular because that puts me down a slope of, because if I say no to that then I have to answer succeeding questions. So what we’ve done is we briefed the chair and ranking on who the U.S. persons are that we have opened investigations on and that is as far as we are going to go at this point.`

- On 3 May 2017, Trump privately expressed he was upset about the hearing and directed it at Sessions’ and his recusal.
    
    - `In the afternoon following Comey’s testimony, the President met with McGahn, Sessions, and Sessions’s Chief of Staff Jody Hunt. At that meeting, the President asked McGahn how Comey had done in his testimony and McGahn relayed that Comey had declined to answer questions about whether the President was under investigation. The President became very upset and directed his anger at Sessions. According to notes written by Hunt, the President said, “This is terrible Jeff. It’s all because you recused. AG is supposed to be most important appointment. Kennedy appointed his brother. Obama appointed Holder. I appointed you and you recused yourself. You left me on an island. I can’t do anything.” The President said that the recusal was unfair and that it was interfering with his ability to govern and undermining his authority with foreign leaders. Sessions responded that he had had no choice but to recuse, and it was a mandatory rather than discretionary decision.` - [Report On The Investigation Into Russian Interference In The 2016 Presidential Election, Department of Justice, 2019](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download)
    
- On 3 May 2017, Trump privately expressed considering replacing Comey as FBI Director.
    
    - `Hunt recalled that Sessions also stated at some point during the conversation that a new start at the FBI would be appropriate and the President should consider replacing Comey as FBI director. According to Sessions, when the meeting concluded, it was clear that the President was unhappy with Comey, but Sessions did not think the President had made the decision to terminate Comey.` - [Report On The Investigation Into Russian Interference In The 2016 Presidential Election, Department of Justice, 2019](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download)
    
- On 5-7 May 2017, Trump privately discussed with advisors the idea of including that Trump was not under investigation and other phraseology of the termination letter to be sent to Comey. This also included wanting to make the story around Comey’s firing to look like a culmination of his actions in a review period, rather than the FBI investigation.
    
    - `At a dinner on Friday, May 5, attended by the President and various advisors and family members, including Jared Kushner and senior advisor Stephen Miller, the President stated that he wanted to remove Comey and had ideas for a letter that would be used to make the announcement. The President dictated arguments and specific language for the letter, and Miller took notes. As reflected in the notes, the President told Miller that the letter should start, “While I greatly appreciate you informing me that I am not under investigation concerning what I have often stated is a fabricated story on a Trump-Russia relationship – pertaining to the 2016 presidential election, please be informed that I, and I believe the American public – including Ds and Rs – have lost faith in you as Director of the FBI.” Following the dinner, Miller prepared a termination letter based on those notes and research he conducted to  
    - support the President’s arguments. Over the weekend, the President provided several rounds of edits on the draft letter. Miller said the President was adamant that he not tell anyone at the White House what they were preparing because the President was worried about leaks.  
    -   
    - In his discussions with Miller, the President made clear that he wanted the letter to open with a reference to him not being under investigation. Miller said he believed that fact was important to the President to show that Comey was not being terminated based on any such investigation. According to Miller, the President wanted to establish as a factual matter that Comey had been under a “review period” and did not have assurance from the President that he would be permitted to keep his job.` - Mueller Report  
    - [link](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download)
    
- On 9 May 2017, Trump fired Comey by way of a termination letter in which he stated that he was acting on the recommendation of Sessions and Rosenstein which was included with the letter.
    
    - `I have received the attached letters from the Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General of the United States recommending your dismissal as the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. I have accepted their recommendation and you are hereby terminated and removed from office, effective immediately.  
    -   
    - While I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation, I nevertheless concur with the judgment of the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the Bureau.  
    -   
    - It is essential that we find new leadership for the FBI that restores public trust and confidence in its vital law enforcement mission.`

- On 17 May 2017, Robert Mueller is appointed Special Counsel by Rosenstein and was authorized to continue Comey’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation. Trump was not personally under investigation, until his firing of Comey raised suspicions of obstruction of justice, which triggered the Mueller investigation.
    
    - `The Special Counsel is authorized to conduct the investigation confirmed by then-FBI Director James B. Comey in testimony before the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence on March 20, 2017, including:  
    -   
    - (i) any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump; and  
    - (ii) any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation; and  
    - (iii) any other matters within the scope of 28 C.F.R. § 600.4(a).`

    - `Soon after the firing of Comey and the appointment of the Special Counsel, however, the President became aware that his own conduct was being investigated in an obstruction-of-justice inquiry.` - [Report On The Investigation Into Russian Interference In The 2016 Presidential Election, Department of Justice, 2019](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download)
    
- On 8 June 2017, Comey publicly testified to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence that he told Trump, on three occasions, that Trump was not personally under investigation and provided memos of such occasions between Trump and Comey.
    
    - `On the morning of March 30, the President called me at the FBI. He described the Russia investigation as “a cloud” that was impairing his ability to act on behalf of the country. He said he had nothing to do with Russia, had not been involved with hookers in Russia, and had always assumed he was being recorded when in Russia. He asked what we could do to “lift the cloud.” I responded that we were investigating the matter as quickly as we could, and that there would be great benefit, if we didn’t find anything, to our having done the work well. He agreed, but then re-emphasized the problems this was causing him.  
    -   
    - Then the President asked why there had been a congressional hearing about Russia the previous week – at which I had, as the Department of Justice directed, confirmed the investigation into possible coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign. I explained the demands from the leadership of both parties in Congress for more information, and that Senator Grassley had even held up the confirmation of the Deputy Attorney General until we briefed him in detail on the investigation. I explained that we had briefed the leadership of Congress on exactly which individuals we were investigating and that we had told those Congressional leaders that we were not personally investigating President Trump. I reminded him I had previously told him that. He repeatedly told me, “We need to get that fact out.” (I did not tell the President that the FBI and the Department of Justice had been reluctant to make public statements that we did not have an open case on President Trump for a number of reasons, most importantly because it would create a duty to correct, should that change.)` Comey’s Statement for the Record for the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence -

# Trump Reacts to Mueller’s Investigation
- On 17 May 2017, Just after Mueller’s appointment, Trump expresses his discontent about Mueller’s Investigation to White House Staff and Sessions, claims that `This is the end of my Presidency` and that Sessions should of protected him.
    
    - `On May 17, 2017, Acting Attorney General Rosenstein appointed Robert S. Mueller, III as Special Counsel and authorized him to conduct the Russia investigation and matters that arose from the investigation. The President learned of the Special Counsel’s appointment from Sessions, who was with the President, Hunt, and McGahn conducting interviews for a new FBI Director. Sessions stepped out of the Oval Office to take a call from Rosenstein, who told him about the Special Counsel appointment, and Sessions then returned to inform the President of the news. According to notes written by Hunt, when Sessions told the President that a Special Counsel had been appointed, the President slumped back in his chair and said, “Oh my God. This is terrible. This is the end of my Presidency. I’m fucked.” The President became angry and lambasted the Attorney General for his decision to recuse from the investigation, stating, “How could you let this happen, Jeff?” The President said the position of Attorney General was his most important appointment and that Sessions had “let [him] down,” contrasting him to Eric Holder and Robert Kennedy. Sessions recalled that the President said to him, “you were supposed to protect me,” or words to that effect. The President returned to the consequences of the appointment and said, “Everyone tells me if you get one of these independent counsels it ruins your presidency. It takes years and years and I won’t be able to do anything. This is the worst thing that ever happened to me.”` - [Report On The Investigation Into Russian Interference In The 2016 Presidential Election, Department of Justice, 2019](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download)
    
- On 17 May 2017, Trump asks Sessions to submit his resignation.
    
    - `The President then told Sessions he should resign as Attorney General. Sessions agreed to submit his resignation and left the Oval Office. Hicks saw the President shortly after Sessions departed and described the President as being extremely upset by the Special Counsel’s appointment. Hicks said that she had only seen the President like that one other time, when the Access Hollywood tape came out during the campaign.` - [Report On The Investigation Into Russian Interference In The 2016 Presidential Election, Department of Justice, 2019](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download)
    
- On 18 May 2017, Sessions finalises the resignation letter and is asked by Trump if Sessions wants to still be Attorney General. after learning Trump was holding on to the letter, it is then viewed as a weapon Trump wielded over the DOJ.
    
    - `The next day, May 18, 2017, FBI agents delivered to McGahn a preservation notice that discussed an investigation related to Comey’s termination and directed the White House to preserve all relevant documents. When he received the letter, McGahn issued a document hold to White House staff and instructed them not to send out any burn bags over the weekend while he sorted things out.  
    -   
    - Also on May 18, Sessions finalized a resignation letter that stated, “Pursuant to our conversation of yesterday, and at your request, I hereby offer my resignation.” Sessions, accompanied by Hunt, brought the letter to the White House and handed it to the President. The President put the resignation letter in his pocket and asked Sessions several times whether he wanted to continue serving as Attorney General. Sessions ultimately told the President he wanted to stay, but it was up to the President. The President said he wanted Sessions to stay. At the conclusion of the meeting, the President shook Sessions’s hand but did not return the resignation letter.  
    -   
    - When Priebus and Bannon learned that the President was holding onto Sessions’s resignation letter, they became concerned that it could be used to influence the Department of Justice. Priebus told Sessions it was not good for the President to have the letter because it would function as a kind of “shock collar” that the President could use any time he wanted; Priebus said the President had “DOJ by the throat.” Priebus and Bannon told Sessions they would attempt to get the letter back from the President with a notation that he was not accepting Sessions’s resignation.` - Mueller Report

Hicks recalled that on the President’s flight from Saudi Arabia to Tel Aviv, the President pulled Sessions’s resignation letter from his pocket, showed it to a group of senior advisors, and asked them what he should do about it. During the trip, Priebus asked about the resignation letter so he could return it to Sessions, but the President told him that the letter was back at the White House, somewhere in the residence.` - [Report On The Investigation Into Russian Interference In The 2016 Presidential Election, Department of Justice, 2019](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download)

# Trump Tries to Remove Mueller
- On 14 June 2017, The Washington Post releases an article revealing that Trump is under investigation for Obstruction of Justice.
    
    - `The special counsel overseeing the investigation into Russia’s role in the 2016 election is interviewing senior intelligence officials as part of a widening probe that now includes an examination of whether President Trump attempted to obstruct justice, officials said.  
    -   
    - The move by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III to investigate Trump’s conduct marks a major turning point in the nearly year-old FBI investigation, which until recently focused on Russian meddling during the presidential campaign and on whether there was any coordination between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin. Investigators have also been looking for any evidence of possible financial crimes among Trump associates, officials said.`

    - `On the evening of June 14, 2017, the Washington Post published an article stating that the Special Counsel was investigating whether the President had attempted to obstruct justice. This was the first public report that the President himself was under investigation by the Special Counsel’s Office, and cable news networks quickly picked up on the report. The Post story stated that the Special Counsel was interviewing intelligence community leaders, including Coats and Rogers, about what the President had asked them to do in response to Comey’s March 20, 2017 testimony; that the inquiry into obstruction marked “a major turning point” in the investigation; and that while “Trump had received private assurances from then-FBI Director James B. Comey starting in January that he was not personally under investigation,” “[o]fficials say that changed shortly after Comey’s firing.” That evening, at approximately 10:31 p.m., the President called McGahn on McGahn’s personal cell phone and they spoke for about 15 minutes. McGahn did not have a clear memory of the call but thought they might have discussed the stories reporting that the President was under investigation.` - [Report On The Investigation Into Russian Interference In The 2016 Presidential Election, Department of Justice, 2019](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download)
    
- On 15 & 16 June 2017, Trump tweets multiple times about the public revelation of the Obstruction of Justice investigation.
    
    - `Beginning early the next day, June 15, 2017, the President issued a series of tweets acknowledging the existence of the obstruction investigation and criticizing it. He wrote: “They made up a phony collusion with the Russians story, found zero proof, so now they go for obstruction of justice on the phony story. Nice”; “You are witnessing the single greatest WITCH HUNT in American political history—led by some very bad and conflicted people!”; and “Crooked H destroyed phones w/ hammer, ‘bleached’ emails, & had husband meet w/AG days before she was cleared—& they talk about obstruction?” The next day, June 16, 2017, the President wrote additional tweets criticizing the investigation: “After 7 months of investigations & committee hearings about my ‘collusion with the Russians,’ nobody has been able to show any proof. Sad!”; and “I am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI Director! Witch Hunt.”` - [Report On The Investigation Into Russian Interference In The 2016 Presidential Election, Department of Justice, 2019](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download)
    
- On 17 June 2017, Trump ordered McGahn to remove the Special Counsel citing conflicts of interest.
    
    - `On Saturday, June 17, 2017, the President called McGahn and directed him to have the Special Counsel removed. McGahn was at home and the President was at Camp David. In interviews with this Office, McGahn recalled that the President called him at home twice and on  
    - both occasions directed him to call Rosenstein and say that Mueller had conflicts that precluded him from serving as Special Counsel.  
    -   
    - On the first call, McGahn recalled that the President said something like, “You gotta do this. You gotta call Rod.” McGahn said he told the President that he would see what he could do. McGahn was perturbed by the call and did not intend to act on the request. He and other advisors believed the asserted conflicts were “silly” and “not real,” and they had previously communicated that view to the President. McGahn also had made clear to the President that the White House Counsel’s Office should not be involved in any effort to press the issue of conflicts. McGahn was concerned about having any role in asking the Acting Attorney General to fire the Special Counsel because he had grown up in the Reagan era and wanted to be more like Judge Robert Bork and not “Saturday Night Massacre Bork.” McGahn considered the President’s request to be an inflection point and he wanted to hit the brakes.  
    -   
    - When the President called McGahn a second time to follow up on the order to call the Department of Justice, McGahn recalled that the President was more direct, saying something like, “Call Rod, tell Rod that Mueller has conflicts and can’t be the Special Counsel.” McGahn recalled the President telling him “Mueller has to go” and “Call me back when you do it.” McGahn understood the President to be saying that the Special Counsel had to be removed by Rosenstein. To end the conversation with the President, McGahn left the President with the impression that McGahn would call Rosenstein. McGahn recalled that he had already said no to the President’s request and he was worn down, so he just wanted to get off the phone.` - Mueller Report  
    - [link](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download)
    
- On 17 June 2017, McGahn considers resigning in response to Trump’s request, decides against it and decided not to mention whether he followed through with it.
    
    - `McGahn recalled feeling trapped because he did not plan to follow the President’s directive but did not know what he would say the next time the President called. McGahn decided he had to resign. He called his personal lawyer and then called his chief of staff, Annie Donaldson, to inform her of his decision. He then drove to the office to pack his belongings and submit his resignation letter. Donaldson recalled that McGahn told her the President had called and demanded he contact the Department of Justice and that the President wanted him to do something that McGahn did not want to do. McGahn told Donaldson that the President had called at least twice and in one of the calls asked “have you done it?” McGahn did not tell Donaldson the specifics of the President’s request because he was consciously trying not to involve her in the investigation, but Donaldson inferred that the President’s directive was related to the Russia investigation. Donaldson prepared to resign along with McGahn.  
    -   
    - That evening, McGahn called both Priebus and Bannon and told them that he intended to resign. McGahn recalled that, after speaking with his attorney and given the nature of the President’s request, he decided not to share details of the President’s request with other White House staff. Priebus recalled that McGahn said that the President had asked him to “do crazy shit,” but he thought McGahn did not tell him the specifics of the President’s request because McGahn was trying to protect Priebus from what he did not need to know. Priebus and Bannon both urged McGahn not to quit, and McGahn ultimately returned to work that Monday and remained in his position. He had not told the President directly that he planned to resign, and when they next saw each other the President did not ask McGahn whether he had followed through with calling Rosenstein.` - Mueller Report

# Trump Tries to Limit Mueller’s Investigation
- On 19 July 2017, Trump meets with former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and discusses Sessions’ recusal, which led to Trump voicing a draft speech for Sessions.
    
    - `On June 19, 2017, two days after the President directed McGahn to have the Special Counsel removed, the President met one-on-one in the Oval Office with his former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. Senior White House advisors described Lewandowski as a “devotee” of the President and said the relationship between the President and Lewandowski was “close.”  
    -   
    - During the June 19 meeting, Lewandowski recalled that, after some small talk, the President brought up Sessions and criticized his recusal from the Russia investigation. The President told Lewandowski that Sessions was weak and that if the President had known about the likelihood of recusal in advance, he would not have appointed Sessions. The President then asked Lewandowski to deliver a message to Sessions and said “write this down.” This was the first time the President had asked Lewandowski to take dictation, and Lewandowski wrote as fast as possible to make sure he captured the content correctly.  
    -   
    - The President directed that Sessions should give a speech publicly announcing:  
    -   
    - I know that I recused myself from certain things having to do with specific areas. But our POTUS . . . is being treated very unfairly. He shouldn’t have a Special Prosecutor/Counsel b/c he hasn’t done anything wrong. I was on the campaign w/ him for nine months, there were no Russians involved with him. I know it for a fact b/c I was there. He didn’t do anything wrong except he ran the greatest campaign in American history.  
    -   
    - The dictated message went on to state that Sessions would meet with the Special Counsel to limit his jurisdiction to future election interference:  
    -   
    - Now a group of people want to subvert the Constitution of the United States. I am going to meet with the Special Prosecutor to explain this is very unfair and let the Special Prosecutor move forward with investigating election meddling for future elections so that nothing can happen in future elections.` - Mueller Report

- On 19 July 2017, Trump held an interview with The New York Times, in which he expressed more criticism of Sessions’ recusal.
    
    - `on July 19, 2017, the President gave an unplanned interview to the New York Times in which he criticized Sessions’s decision to  
    - recuse from the Russia investigation. The President said that “Sessions should have never recused himself, and if he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me before he took the job, and I would have picked somebody else.” Sessions’s recusal, the President said, was “very unfair to the president. How do you take a job and then recuse yourself? If he would have recused  
    - himself before the job, I would have said, ‘Thanks, Jeff, but I can’t, you know, I’m not going to take you.’ It’s extremely unfair, and that’s a mild word, to the president.” Hicks, who was present for the interview, recalled trying to “throw [herself] between the reporters and [the President]” to stop parts of the interview, but the President “loved the interview.”` - Mueller Report

    - `on July 21, 2017, the Washington Post reported that U.S. intelligence intercepts showed that Sessions had discussed campaign-related matters with the Russian ambassador, contrary to what Sessions had said publicly.` - [Report On The Investigation Into Russian Interference In The 2016 Presidential Election, Department of Justice, 2019](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download)
    
    - `Russia’s ambassador to Washington told his superiors in Moscow that he discussed campaign-related matters, including policy issues important to Moscow, with Jeff Sessions during the 2016 presidential race, contrary to public assertions by the embattled attorney general, according to current and former U.S. officials.

    - Ambassador Sergey Kislyak’s accounts of two conversations with Sessions — then a top foreign policy adviser to Republican candidate Donald Trump — were intercepted by U.S. spy agencies, which monitor the communications of senior Russian officials in the United States and in Russia. Sessions initially failed to disclose his contacts with Kislyak and then said that the meetings were not about the Trump campaign.  
    -   
    - One U.S. official said that Sessions — who testified that he had no recollection of an April encounter — has provided “misleading” statements that are “contradicted by other evidence.” A former official said that the intelligence indicates that Sessions and Kislyak had “substantive” discussions on matters including Trump’s positions on Russia-related issues and prospects for U.S.-Russia relations in a Trump administration.`

    - Hunt when the media had reported on tensions between Sessions and the President, and, after speaking to Sessions, Hunt had told Priebus that the President would have to fire Sessions if he wanted to remove Sessions because Sessions was not going to quit. According to Hunt, who took contemporaneous notes of the July 21 call, Hunt told Priebus that, as they had previously discussed, Sessions had no intention of resigning. Hunt asked Priebus what the President would accomplish by firing Sessions, pointing out there was an investigation before and there would be an investigation after.` - Mueller Report

    - `Priebus believed that the President’s request was a problem, so he called McGahn and asked for advice, explaining that he did not want to pull the trigger on something that was “all wrong.” Although the President tied his desire for Sessions to resign to Sessions’s negative press and poor performance in congressional testimony, Priebus believed that the President’s desire to replace Sessions was driven by the President’s hatred of Sessions’s recusal from the Russia investigation. McGahn told Priebus not to follow the President’s order and said they should consult their personal counsel, with whom they had attorney-client privilege.

Are you working on it?” Priebus said that he believed that his job depended on whether he followed the order to remove Sessions, although the President did not directly say so. Even though Priebus did not intend to carry out the President’s directive, he told the President he would get Sessions to resign. Later in the day, Priebus called the President and explained that it would be a calamity if Sessions resigned because Priebus expected that Rosenstein and Associate Attorney General Rachel Brand would also resign and the President would be unable to get anyone else confirmed.

Sessions replace Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, a Comey friend who was in charge of Clinton investigation.” According to Hunt, in light of the President’s frequent public attacks, Sessions prepared another resignation letter and for the rest of the year carried it with him in his pocket every time he went to the White House.` - [Report On The Investigation Into Russian Interference In The 2016 Presidential Election, Department of Justice, 2019](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download)
    
# Trump Orders McGahn to Deny That Trump Tried Removing Mueller

    - `On January 25, 2018, the New York Times reported that in June 2017, the President had ordered McGahn to have the Department of Justice fire the Special Counsel. According to the article, “[a]mid the first wave of news media reports that Mr. Mueller was examining a possible obstruction case, the president began to argue that Mr. Mueller had three conflicts of interest that disqualified him from overseeing the investigation.” The article further reported that “[a]fter receiving the president’s order to fire Mr. Mueller, the White House counsel . . . refused to ask the Justice Department to dismiss the special counsel, saying he would quit instead.” The article stated that the president “ultimately backed down after the White House counsel threatened to resign rather than carry out the directive.”` - [Report On The Investigation Into Russian Interference In The 2016 Presidential Election, Department of Justice, 2019](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download)

    - `The next day, on February 5, 2018, the President complained about the Times article to Porter. The President told Porter that the article was “bullshit” and he had not sought to terminate the Special Counsel. The President said that McGahn leaked to the media to make himself look good. The President then directed Porter to tell McGahn to create a record to make clear that the President never directed McGahn to fire the Special Counsel. Porter thought the matter should be handled by the White House communications office, but the President said he wanted McGahn to write a letter to the file “for our records” and wanted something beyond a press statement to demonstrate that the reporting was inaccurate. The President referred to McGahn as a “lying bastard” and said that he wanted a record from him. Porter recalled the President saying something to the effect of, “If he doesn’t write a letter, then maybe I’ll have to get rid of him.”  
    -   
    - Later that day, Porter spoke to McGahn to deliver the President’s message. Porter told McGahn that he had to write a letter to dispute that he was ever ordered to terminate the Special Counsel. McGahn shrugged off the request, explaining that the media reports were true. McGahn told Porter that the President had been insistent on firing the Special Counsel and that McGahn had planned to resign rather than carry out the order, although he had not personally told the President he intended to quit. Porter told McGahn that the President suggested that McGahn would be fired if he did not write the letter. McGahn dismissed the threat, saying that the optics would be terrible if the President followed through with firing him on that basis. McGahn said he would not write the letter the President had requested. Porter said that to his knowledge the issue of McGahn’s letter never came up with the President again, but Porter did recall telling Kelly about his conversation with McGahn.` - Mueller Report

# Nunes & Schiff Memos
- On 18 January 2018, Devin Nunes, the then-Chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, released a memorandum that detailed alleged surveillance abuses by the FBI & DOJ during the investigation.
- The Nunes memo alleges that the FBI, in the process of seeking a FISA warrant from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to monitor the communications of Carter Page, a foreign policy advisor to Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, relied on the Steele dossier, an opposition research document funded by the DNC and the Hillary Clinton campaign, without adequately disclosing its political origins. The memo further alleges that the FBI failed to disclose to the FISC that the Steele dossier was partially funded by the DNC and the Clinton campaign, and that a source in the dossier was in touch with a senior DOJ official.
    
    - `1) The "dossier" compiled by Christopher Steele (Steele dossier) on behalf of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and the Hillary Clinton campaign formed an essential part of the Carter Page FISA application. Steele was a longtime FBI source who was paid over $160,000 by the DNC and Clinton campaign, Via the law 'firm Perkins Cole and research firm Fusion GPS, to obtain derogatory information on Donald Trump's ties to Russia.  
    -   
    - a) Neither the initial application in October 2016, nor any of the renewals, disclose or reference the role of the DNC, Clinton campaign, or. any party/campaign in funding Steele's efforts, even though the political origins of the Steele dossier were then known to senior DOJ and FBI officials.` - Nunes Memo  
    - [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20180921061353/https://intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/memo_and_white_house_letter.pdf)
    
- It also alleges that the FBI and DOJ had a political bias in favour of Clinton, citing the texts of senior FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page.
    
    - `Strzok was reassigned by the Special Counsel's Office to FBI Human Resources for improper text messages with his mistress, FBI Attorney Lisa Page (no known relation to Carter Page), where they both demonstrated a clear bias against Trump and in favor of Clinton, whom Strzok had also investigated. The Strzok/Lisa Page texts also reflect extensive discussions about the investigation, orchestrating leaks to the media, and include a meeting with Deputy Director McCabe to discuss an "insurance" policy against President Trump's election.` - Nunes Memo [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20180921061353/https://intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/memo_and_white_house_letter.pdf)
    
- The memo further argues that the FISA warrant would not have been issued without the Steele dossier.
    
    - `The Carter Page FISA application also cited extensively a September 23, 2016, Yahoo News article by Michael Isikoff, which focuses on Page's July 2016 trip to Moscow. This article does not corroborate the Steele dossier because it is derived from information leaked by Steele himself to Yahoo News. The Page FISA application incorrectly assesses that Steele did not directly provide information to Yahoo News. Steele has admitted in British court filings that he met with Yahoo News—and several other. outlets—in September 2016 at the direction of Fusion GPS. Perkins Coie was aware of Steele's initial media contacts because they hosted at least one meeting in Washington DC. in 2016 with Steele and Fusion GPS where this matter was discussed.` - Nunes Memo [link](https://irp.fas.org/congress/2018_cr/nunes-memo.pdf)
    
- The memo also confirmed, before the Mueller Report was finished, that the Steele Dossier was not the reason for the original FBI investigation opening, rather the reason then stated in the Mueller Report
    
    - `The Page FISA application also mentions information regarding fellow Trump campaign advisor George Papadopoulos, but there is no evidence of any cooperation or conspiracy between Page and Papadopoulos. The Papadopoulos information triggered the opening of an FBI counterintelligence investigation in late July 2016 by FBI agent Pete Strzok.` - Nunes Memo [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20180921061353/https://intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/memo_and_white_house_letter.pdf)
    
- On 24 January 2018, Assistant Attorney General Steven Boyd sent a letter to the HPSCI.
    
    - `In addition, we have also heard that HPSCI is considering making the classified memorandum available to the public and the media, an unprecedented action. We believe it would be extraordinarily reckless for the Committee to disclose such information publicly without giving the Department and the FBI the opportunity to review the memorandum and to advise the HPSCI of the risk of harm to national security and to ongoing investigations that could come from public release. Indeed, we do not understand why the Committee would possibly seek to disclose classified and law enforcement sensitive information without first consulting with the relevant members of the Intelligence Community.` [link](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/4359834/DOJ-Letter-to-Nunes.pdf)
    
- On 24 January 2018, The FBI released a statement on the Nunes Memo mentioning grave concerns of material ommissions.
    
    - `The FBI takes seriously its obligations to the FISA Court and its compliance with procedures overseen by career professionals in the Department of Justice and the FBI. We are committed to working with the appropriate oversight entities to ensure the continuing integrity of the FISA process.  
    -   
    - With regard to the House Intelligence Committee’s memorandum, the FBI was provided a limited opportunity to review this memo the day before the committee voted to release it. As expressed during our initial review, we have grave concerns about material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo’s accuracy.`  
    - [link](https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/fbi-statement-on-hpsci-memo)
    
- On 29 January 2018, Adam Schiff, Ranking Member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence released a memorandum that detailed disagreements with the Nunes Memo.
    
    - `The HPSCI Majority's move to release to the House of Representatives its allegations against the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) is a transparent effort to undermine those agencies, the Special Counsel, and Congress' investigations. It also risks public exposure of sensitive sources and methods for no legitimate purpose.  
    -   
    - FBI and DOJ officials did "abuse" the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) process, omit material information, or subvert this vital tool to spy on the Trump campaign.  
    -   
    - In fact, DOJ and the FBI would have been remiss in their duty to protect the country had they not sought a FISA warrant and repeated renewals to conduct temporary surveillance of Carter Page, someone the FBI assessed to be an agent of the Russian government. DOJ met the rigor. transparency. and evidentiary basis needed to meet FISA's probable cause requirement, by demonstrating:  
    -   
    - contemporaneous evidence of Russia's election interference;  
    - concerning Russian links and outreach to Trump campaign officials;  
    - Page's history with Russian intelligence; and  
    - [REDACTED] Page's suspicious activities in 2016, including in Moscow.  
    -   
    - The Committee's Minority has therefore prepared this memorandum to correct the record:  
    -   
    - Christopher Steele's raw intelligence reporting did not inform the FBI's decision to initiate its counterintelligence investigation in late July 2016. In fact, the FBI's closely-held investigative team only received Steele's reporting in mid-September— more than seven weeks later. The FBI — and, subsequently, the Special Counsel's — investigation into links between the Russian government and Trump campaign associates has been based on troubling law enforcement and intelligence information unrelated to the "dossier."  
    -   
    - DOJ's October 21, 2016 FISA application and three subsequent renewals carefully outlined for the Court a multi-pronged rationale for surveilling Page, who, at the time of the first application, was no longer with the Trump campaign. DOJ detailed Page's past relationships with Russian spies and interaction with Russian officials during the 2016 campaign, [REDACTED] DOJ cited multiple sources to support the case for surveilling Page -—- but made only narrow use of information from Steele's sources about Page's specific activities in 2016, chiefly his suspected July 2016 meetings in Moscow with Russian officials. [REDACTED] In fact, the FBI interviewed Page in March 2016 about his contact with Russian intelligence, the very month candidate Donald Trump named him a foreign policy advisor.  
    -   
    - As DOJ informed the Court in subsequent renewals, [REDACTED] Steele's reporting about Page's Moscow meetings [REDACTED]. DOJ's applications did not otherwise rely on Steele's reporting, including any "salacious" allegations about Trump, and the FBI never paid Steele for this reporting. While explaining why the FBI viewed Steele's reporting and sources as reliable and credible, DOJ also disclosed:  
    -   
    - Steele's prior relationship with the FBI;  
    - the fact of and reason for his termination as a source; and  
    - the assessed political motivation of those who hired him.  
    -   
    - The Committee Majority's memorandum, which draws selectively on highly sensitive classified information, includes other distortions and misrepresentations that are contradicted by the underlying classified documents, which the vast majority of Members of the Committee and the House have not had the opportunity to review and which Chairman Nunes chose not to read himself.` - Schiff Memo

# Barr Letter
- On 24 March 2019, Barr sent a letter to leaders of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees detailing the purported "principal conclusions" of the Mueller report. The letter included some brief fragments from the Mueller report, but when the document is public, his selections came under scrutiny.
    
    - `In making this determination, we noted that the special counsel recognized that ‘the evidence does not establish that the president was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference,’ and that, while not determinative, the absence of such evidence bears upon the president’s intent with respect to obstruction.` - Barr Letter [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20190401160320/https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/democrats.judiciary.house.gov/files/documents/AG%20March%2024%202019%20Letter%20to%20House%20and%20Senate%20Judiciary%20Committees.pdf)
    - 
    - > `Obstruction of justice can be motivated by a desire to protect noncriminal personal interests, to protect against investigations where underlying criminal liability falls into a gray area, or to avoid personal embarrassment. The injury to the integrity of the justice system is the same regardless of whether a person committed an underlying wrong. In this investigation, the evidence does not establish that the president was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference. But the evidence does point to a range of other possible personal motives animating the president’s conduct. These include concerns that continued investigation would call into question the legitimacy of his election and potential uncertainty about whether certain events — such as advance notice of WikiLeaks’ release of hacked information or the June 9, 2016, meeting between senior campaign officials and Russians could be seen as criminal activity by the president, his campaign or his family.` - [Report On The Investigation Into Russian Interference In The 2016 Presidential Election, Department of Justice, 2019](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download)

Although the investigation established that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome, and that the campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts, the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.` - [Report On The Investigation Into Russian Interference In The 2016 Presidential Election, Department of Justice, 2019](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download)

Given those considerations, the facts known to us, and the strong public interest in safeguarding the integrity of the criminal justice system, we conducted a thorough factual investigation in order to preserve the evidence when memories were fresh and documentary materials were available.` - [Report On The Investigation Into Russian Interference In The 2016 Presidential Election, Department of Justice, 2019](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download)
    
    - `The special counsel therefore did not draw a conclusion — one way or the other — as to whether the examined conduct constituted obstruction. Instead, for each of the relevant actions investigated, the report sets out evidence on both sides of the question and leaves unresolved what the special counsel views as ‘difficult issues’ of law and fact concerning whether the president’s actions and intent could be viewed as obstruction. The special counsel states that ‘while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.’` - Barr Letter [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20190401160320/https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/democrats.judiciary.house.gov/files/documents/AG%20March%2024%202019%20Letter%20to%20House%20and%20Senate%20Judiciary%20Committees.pdf)

- On 27 March 2019, Mueller sent a letter to Barr detailing criticism of Barr’s letter saying there was now public confusion about Mueller’s investigation.
    
    - `As we stated in our meeting of March 5 and reiterated to the Department early in the afternoon of March 24, the introductions and executive summaries of our two-volume report accurately summarize this Office’s work and conclusions. The summary letter the Department sent to Congress and released to the public late in the afternoon of March 24 did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance of this Office’s work and conclusions. We communicated that concern to the Department on the morning of March 25. There is now public confusion about critical aspects of the results of our investigation. This threatens to undermine a central purpose for which the Department appointed the Special Counsel: to assure full public confidence in the outcome of the investigations. See Department of Justice, Press Release (May 17, 2017).  
    -   
    - While we understand that the Department is reviewing the full report to determine what is appropriate for public release—a process that our Office is working with you to complete—that process need not delay release of the enclosed materials. Release at this time would alleviate the misunderstandings that have arisen and would answer congressional and public questions about the nature and outcome of our investigation. It would also accord with the standard for public release of notifications to Congress cited in your letter.` - Mueller's Letter

## Inditing of a Sitting President
- On 24 September 1973, The Office of Legal Counsel wrote a memo advising the then-Assistant Attorney General Robert Dixon, on the question of `Amenability of the President, Vice President and other Civil Officers to Federal Criminal Prosecution while in Office`.
    
    - `In sum, an interpretation of the Constitution which requires the completion of impeachment proceedings before a criminal prosecution can be instituted would enable persons who are or were employed by the Government to raise a number of extremely technical and complex defenses. It also would pressure Congress to conduct a large number of impeachment proceedings which would weigh heavily on its limited time. Such an interpretation of the Constitution is prima facie erroneous.` - 1973 OLC Memo [link](https://irp.fas.org/agency/doj/olc/092473.pdf)
    
- On 13 May 1998, The Office of Legal Counsel wrote a memo advising the then-Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, on the question of `whether a sitting President is subject to indictment`.
    
    - `These factors all buttress and lead to the same conclusion: it is proper, constitutional, and legal for a federal grand jury to indict a sitting President for serious criminal acts that are not part of, and are contrary to, the President's official duties. In this country, no one, even President Clinton, is above the law.  
    -   
    - This conclusion does not imply that a President must be required to serve an actual prison term before he leaves office. 'The defendant President could remain free pending his trial and the trial court could defer any prison sentence until he leaves  
    - office. The defendant-President may petition the courts to exercise its discretion in appropriate cases. It is one thing for the to petition the court to exercise its discretion; it is quite another for the President to announce that he is above the law and immune from criminal prosecution.` - 1998 OLC Memo

- On 16 October 2000, The Office of Legal Counsel wrote a memo advising the then-Assistant Attorney General Randolph Moss, on the question of `A Sitting President's Amenability to Indictment and Criminal Prosecution`.
    
    - `The indictment or criminal prosecution of a sitting President would impermissibly undermine the capacity of the executive branch to perform its constitutionally assigned functions` - 2000 OLC Memo [link](https://www.justice.gov/d9/olc/opinions/2000/10/31/op-olc-v024-p0222_0.pdf)
    
- On 18 April 2019, Mueller confirmed that no traditional prosecutorial judgment was to be made in regards to Trump Obstructing Justice, using The DOJ Justice Manual and the 2000 OLC Memo as reason not to.
    
    - `First, a traditional prosecution or declination decision entails a binary determination to initiate or decline a prosecution, but we determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment. The Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) has issued an opinion finding that “the indictment or criminal prosecution of a sitting President would impermissibly undermine the capacity of the executive branch to perform its constitutionally assigned functions” in violation of the constitutional separation of powers.” Given the role of the Special Counsel as an attorney in the Department of Justice and the framework of the Special Counsel regulations, see 28 U.S.C. § 515; 28 C.F.R. § 600.7(a), this Office accepted OLC’s legal conclusion for the purpose of exercising prosecutorial jurisdiction. And apart from OLC’s constitutional view, we recognized that a federal criminal accusation against a sitting President would place burdens on the President’s capacity to govern and potentially preempt constitutional processes for addressing presidential misconduct.  
    -   
    - Second, while the OLC opinion concludes that a sitting President may not be prosecuted, it recognizes that a criminal investigation during the President’s term is permissible. The OLC opinion also recognizes that a President does not have immunity after he leaves office. And if individuals other than the President committed an obstruction offense, they may be prosecuted at this time. Given those considerations, the facts known to us, and the strong public interest in safeguarding the integrity of the criminal justice system, we conducted a thorough factual investigation in order to preserve the evidence when memories were fresh and documentary materials were available.  
    -   
    - Third, we considered whether to evaluate the conduct we investigated under the Justice Manual standards governing prosecution and declination decisions, but we determined not to apply an approach that could potentially result in a judgment that the President committed crimes. The threshold step under the Justice Manual standards is to assess whether a person’s conduct “constitutes a federal offense.” U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Justice Manual § 9-27.220(2018) (Justice Manual). Fairness concerns counseled against potentially reaching that judgment when no charges can be brought. The ordinary means for an individual to respond to an accusation is through a speedy and public trial, with all the procedural protections that surround a criminal case. An individual who believes he was wrongly accused can use that process to seek to clear his name. In contrast, a prosecutor’s judgment that crimes were committed, but that no charges will be brought, affords no such adversarial opportunity for public name-clearing before an impartial adjudicator.` - Mueller Report

## `Internet Research Agency` Criminal Inditements
- On 16 February 2018, Yevgeny Prigozhin, the Internet Research Agency, Concord Management, and other connected Russian individuals were indicted by a US grand jury. He was charged with funding and organizing operations for the purpose of interference with the U.S. political and electoral processes, including the 2016 presidential election, and other crimes including identity theft.
    
    - `Defendant INTERNET RESEARCH AGENCY LLC (“ORGANIZATION”) is a Russian organization engaged in operations to interfere with elections and political processes. Defendants MIKHAIL IVANOVICH BYSTROV, MIKHAIL LEONIDOVICH BURCHIK, ALEKSANDRA YURYEVNA KRYLOVA, ANNA VLADISLAVOVNA BOGACHEVA, SERGEY PAVLOVICH POLOZOV, MARIA ANATOLYEVNA BOVDA, ROBERT SERGEYEVICH BOVDA, DZHEYKHUN NASIMI OGLY ASLANOV, VADIM VLADIMIROVICH PODKOPAEV, GLEB IGOREVICH VASILCHENKO, IRINA VIKTOROVNA KAVERZINA, and VLADIMIR VENKOV worked in various capacities to carry out Defendant ORGANIZATION’s interference operations targeting the United States. From in or around 2014 to the present, Defendants knowingly and intentionally conspired with each other (and with persons known and unknown to the Grand Jury) to defraud the United States by impairing, obstructing, and defeating the lawful functions of the government through fraud and deceit for the purpose of interfering with the U.S. political and electoral processes, including the presidential election of 2016.` [link](https://www.justice.gov/file/1035477/download)

    - `Russian businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin said on Monday he had interfered in U.S. elections and would continue doing so in future, the first such admission from a figure implicated by Washington in efforts to influence American politics.  
    -   
    - In comments posted by the press service of his Concord catering firm on Russia's Facebook equivalent VKontakte, Prigozhin said: "We have interfered (in U.S. elections), we are interfering and we will continue to interfere. Carefully, accurately, surgically and in our own way, as we know how to do."  
    -   
    - The remark by the close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin was posted on the eve of the U.S. midterm elections in response to a request for comment from a Russian news site.`

    - `Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of the Russian private military company Wagner, admitted on Tuesday to founding the Internet Research Agency (IRA), a notorious troll farm that the US government has sanctioned for interfering in American elections.  
    -   
    - A Wagner Telegram channel on Tuesday published a statement from Prigozhin, asking him to react to the suggestion that he was the founder of the agency.  
    -   
    - I react with pleasure," Prigozhin said in the statement. "I've never just been the financier of the Internet Research Agency. I invented it, I created it, I managed it for a long time. It was founded to protect the Russian information space from boorish aggressive propaganda of anti-Russian narrative from the West."`

# Inspector General Report on the Crossfire Hurricane Investigation
- On 28 March 2018, Department of Justice Inspector General Michael Horowitz announced that his office would initiate a review of the Crossfire Hurricane investigation.
    
    - `Department of Justice (DOJ) Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz announced today that, in response to requests from the Attorney General and Members of Congress, the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) will initiate a review that will examine the Justice Department’s and the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) compliance with legal requirements, and with applicable DOJ and FBI policies and procedures, in applications filed with the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) relating to a certain U.S. person. As part of this examination, the OIG also will review information that was known to the DOJ and the FBI at the time the applications were filed from or about an alleged FBI confidential source. Additionally, the OIG will review the DOJ’s and FBI’s relationship and communications with the alleged source as they relate to the FISC applications.  
    -   
    - If circumstances warrant, the OIG will consider including other issues that may arise during the course of the review.`  
    - [link](https://oig.justice.gov/press/2018/2018-03-28b.pdf)
    
- On 9 December 2019, the Office of the Inspector General, released a redacted report by Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz called `Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation` [link](https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf)
- On 9 December 2019, U.S. Attorney John Durham, who conducted the [[United States Contents Page]] at the behest of Barr, disagreed with the report's findings.
    
    - `In a statement, Attorney General William P. Barr disagreed with one of the inspector general’s key conclusions, saying the FBI launched an investigation of a presidential campaign “on the thinnest of suspicions that, in my view, were insufficient to justify the steps taken. It is also clear that, from its inception, the evidence produced by the investigation was consistently exculpatory.”  
    -   
    - So, too, did Connecticut U.S. Attorney John Durham, whom Barr handpicked to conduct an investigation similar to that of Horowitz. “Our investigation has included developing information from other persons and entities, both in the U.S. and outside of the U.S.,” Durham said in a statement. “Based on the evidence collected to date, and while our investigation is ongoing, last month we advised the Inspector General that we do not agree with some of the report’s conclusions as to predication and how the FBI case was opened.”`

## Origins of Crossfire Hurricane
- The FBI’s decision to open the Crossfire Hurricane investigation was unanimous amongst major leaders of the FBI including Comey, McCabe and ultimately Priestap, that the Australian diplomats information regarding Papadopoulos was a tipping point in total with prior information the FBI had.
    
    - `McCabe told us that he recalled discussing the FFG information with Priestap, Strzok, then Special Counsel to the Deputy Director Lisa Page, and Comey, sometime before Crossfire Hurricane was opened, and he agreed with opening a counterintelligence investigation based on the FFG information. He told us the decision to open the case was unanimous. McCabe said the FBI viewed the FFG information in the context of Russian attempts to interfere with the 2016 U.S. elections in the years and months prior, as well as the FBI's ongoing investigation into the DNC hack by a Russian Intelligence Service (RIS). He also said that when the FBI received the FFG information it was a "tipping point" in terms of opening a counterintelligence investigation regarding Russia's attempts to influence and interfere with the 2016 U.S. elections because not only was there information that Russia was targeting U.S. political institutions, but now the FBI had received an allegation from a trusted partner that there had been some sort of contact between the Russians and the Trump campaign.` - Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation [link](https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf)
    
    - `From July 28 to July 31, officials at FBI Headquarters discussed the FFG information and whether it warranted opening a counterintelligence investigation. The Assistant Director (AD) for CD, E.W. "Bill" Priestap, was a central figure in these discussions. According to Priestap, he discussed the matter with then Section Chief of CD's Counterespionage Section Peter Strzok, as well as the Section Chief of CD's Counterintelligence Analysis Section I (Intel Section Chief); and with representatives of the FBI's Office of the General Counsel (OGC), including Deputy General Counsel Trisha Anderson and a unit chief (OGC Unit Chief) in OGC's National Security and Cyber Law Branch (NSCLB). Priestap told us that he also discussed the matter with either then Deputy Director (DD) Andrew McCabe or then Executive Assistant Director (EAD) Michael Steinbach, but did not recall discussing the matter with then Director James Comey told the OIG that he did not recall being briefed on the FFG information until after the Crossfire Hurricane investigation was opened, and that he was not involved in the decision to open the case` - Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation [link](https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf)
    
    - `According to Priestap, he authorized opening the Crossfire Hurricane counterintelligence investigation on July 31, 2016, based upon these discussions. He told us that the FFG information was provided by a trusted source-the FFG-and he therefore felt it "wise to open an investigation to look into" whether someone associated with the Trump campaign may have accepted the reported offer from the Russians. Priestap also told us that the combination of the FFG information and the FBI's ongoing cyber intrusion investigation of the DNC hacks created a counterintelligence concern that the FBI was "obligated" to investigate. Priestap said that he did not recall any disagreement about the decision to open Crossfire Hurricane, and told us that he was not pressured to open the case.` - Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation [link](https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf)
    
- Horowitz concluded that the FBI had sufficient reason to open the Crossfire Hurricane Investigation in regards to both DOJ policy and Constitutional Law via the Supreme Court.
    
    - `the factual predication required to open a Full Investigation under the Attorney General's Guidelines for Domestic Operations (AG Guidelines) and the FBI's Domestic Investigations and Operations Guide (DIOG) is an "articulable factual basis" that reasonably indicates that one of several circumstances exist:  
    -   
    - An activity constituting a federal crime or a threat to the national security has or may have occurred, is or may be occurring, or will or may occur and the investigation may obtain information relating to the activity or the involvement or role of an individual, group, or organization in such activity;  
    -   
    - An individual, group, organization, entity, information, property, or activity is or may be a target of attack, victimization, acquisition, infiltration, or recruitment in connection with criminal activity in violation of federal law or a threat to the national security and the investigation may obtain information that would help to protect against such activity or threat; or  
    -   
    - The investigation may obtain foreign intelligence that is responsive to a requirement that the FBI collect positive foreign intelligence ie., information relating to the capabilities, intentions, or activities of foreign governments or elements thereof, foreign organizations or foreign persons, or international terrorists.` - Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation  
    - [link](https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf)
    
    - `In addition to requiring an authorized purpose, Department and FBI policy also mandate that each case have adequate factual predication before being initiated. The predication requirement is not a legal requirement but rather a prudential one imposed by Department and FBI policy. For example, the Supreme Court has held that the Department and FBI can lawfully open a federal criminal grand jury investigation even in the absence of predication. See United States v. Morton Salt, 338 U.S. 632, 642-43 (1950) (a grand jury "can investigate merely on suspicion that the law is being violated, or even just because it wants assurance that it is not"); see also United States v. R. Enterprises, 498 U.S. 292, 297 (1991).` - Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation [link](https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf)
    
    - `We similarly concluded that the FBI had sufficient predication to open full counterintelligence investigations of Papadopoulos, Page, Flynn, and Manafort in August 2016. The investigation of Papadopoulos was predicated upon his alleged statements in May 2016 to an employee of the FFG. According to the opening EC, Papadopoulos was "identical to the individual who made statements indicating that he is knowledgeable that the Russians made a suggestion to the Trump team that they could assist the Trump campaign with an anonymous release of information during the campaign that would be damaging to the Clinton campaign." The three other cases were predicated on information developed by the Crossfire Hurricane team through law enforcement database and open source searches, conducted to determine which individuals associated with the Trump campaign may have been in a position to have received the alleged offer of assistance from Russia. As described in Chapter Three, through these efforts, the Crossfire Hurricane team identified three individuals-Page, Manafort, and Flynn-associated with the Trump campaign with either ties to Russia or a history of travel to Russia, two of whom (Page and Manafort) were already the subjects of open FBI investigations pertaining to, in part, their Russia-related activities. The FBI determined that this information, taken together with the information from the FFG indicating Russia had made a suggestion to the Trump team that it could assist by releasing information damaging to candidate Clinton, stated an articulable factual basis reasonably indicating activity may be occurring that may constitute a federal crime or a threat to national security. As with the opening of Crossfire Hurricane, we concluded that the quantum of information articulated by the FBI to open these individual investigations was sufficient to satisfy the low threshold established by Department and FBI predication policy, particularly in the context of the FBI's separate and ongoing investigative efforts to address Russian interference in 2016 U.S. elections.` - Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation [link](https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf)

- On 5 July 2016, Steele’s reporting was handed over to the Steele’s FBI Handling Agent and expressed concern that if Trump was to become president that it was concerning if Trump was compromised by Russians.
    
    - `Shortly before the Fourth of July 2016, Handling Agent 1 told the OIG that he received a call from Steele requesting an in-person meeting as soon as possible. Handling Agent 1 said he departed his duty station in Europe on July 5 and met with Steele in Steele's office that day. During their meeting, Steele provided Handling Agent 1 with a copy of Report 80 and explained that he had been hired by Fusion GPS to collect information on the relationship between candidate Trump's businesses and Russia. Handling Agent 1 said Steele had become concerned about the possibility of the Russians compromising Trump in the event Trump became President. According to Handling Agent 1, Steele informed him that Fusion GPS had been hired by a law firm to conduct research, though Steele stated that he did not know the law firm's name or its political affiliation. Handling Agent 1 told the OIG, however, that he did not have to ask Steele to know that the request for the research was politically motivated as the connection to politics was obvious to Handling Agent 1 from the circumstances. Handling Agent 1 also told us that he asked Steele to try to identify the law firm. However, Handling Agent 1 said that he did not "continually ask" Steele about the firm's identity as his work with Steele progressed. When asked by the OIG about an October 2016 email from a member of the Crossfire Hurricane team stating that Handling Agent 1 had avoided tasking Steele to obtain the name of the law firm, Handling Agent 1 told us that information was incorrect and that he would never avoid asking a material question. When we asked the email's author about the email, he stated that it accurately represented what Handling Agent 1 had told him during a telephone call in October 2016.` - Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation [link](https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf)
    
- In Late July 2016, Steele was likely aware that the ultimate recipient of the Trump intel was for the DNC.
    
    - `We asked Steele when he learned who had retained Fusion GPS to obtain information concerning Trump and the Trump campaign. He told us he could not recall when he first learned that it was the law firm Perkins Cole and the Democratic National Committee (DNC), though he was certain that it was not at the outset of the engagement with Fusion GPS. Steele further stated that, by late July 2016, Steele had met with Simpson and an attorney from Perkins Cole, which represented the DNC, and Steele said that by that time he was aware of the DNC's role. He stated that he could not remember whether he provided Perkins Cole's name to the FBI but believed it was probable that he did so, but not in July 2016.` - Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation [link](https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf)
    
- On 28 July 2016, The FBI receives Steele's reports 80 and 94 via Steele's Handling Agent.
    
    - `On July 28, 2016, three days prior to the opening of the Crossfire Hurricane investigation, Handling Agent 1 sent Reports 80 and 94 to ASAC 1 in NYFO, who forwarded them to SAC 1. Handling Agent 1 's sharing of the reports with ASAC 1 resulted in a meeting in NYFO on August 3 among ASAC 1, the Chief Division Counsel (CDC), an Associate Division Counsel (ADC), and a Supervisory Special Agent (SSA). Notes taken by the ADC show that the meeting participants discussed in general terms the information contained in Reports 80 and 94 and the relationship between Steele, Simpson, and a "law firm."` - Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation [link](https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf)
    
- On 25 August 2016, The Crossfire Hurricane team requests intelligence information potentially relevant to the investigation.
    
    - `On August 25, 2016, according to a Supervisory Special Agent 1 (SSA 1) who was assigned to the Crossfire Hurricane investigation, during a briefing for then Deputy Director Andrew McCabe on the investigation, McCabe asked SSA 1 to contact NYFO about information that potentially could assist the Crossfire Hurricane investigation. SSA 1 said he reached out to counterintelligence agents and analysts in NYFO within approximately 24 hours following the meeting. Instant messages show that on September 1, SSA 1 spoke with a NYFO counterintelligence supervisor, and that the counterintelligence supervisor was attempting to set up a call between SSA 1 and the ADC.` - Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation [link](https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf)
    
- On 2 September 2016, Steele's Handling Agent inquires where to send the Steele's reports.
    
    - `On September 2, 2016, Handling Agent 1, who had been waiting for NYFO to inform him where to forward Steele's reports, sent the following email to the ADC and counterintelligence supervisor: "Do we have a name yet? The stuff is burning a hole." The ADC responded the same day explaining that SSA 1 had created an electronic sub-file for Handling Agent 1 in the Crossfire Hurricane case and that he should forward the Steele reports to it. However, SSA 1 told us that there was a problem with his attempt to send an email to Handling Agent 1 in early September. SSA 1 said he did not recognize the problem until September 13 and emailed Handling Agent 1 that day with the case information necessary to upload the reports.` - Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation [link](https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf)
    
- On 19 September 2016, The Crossfire Hurricane team receives Steele's reports 80, 94, 95, 100, 101 and 102.
    
    - `On September 19, 2016, the Crossfire Hurricane team received the Steele reporting for the first time when Handling Agent 1 emailed SSA 1 six reports for SSA 1 to upload himself to the sub-file: Reports 80 and 94, and four additional reports (Reports 95, 100, 101, and 102) that Handling Agent 1 had since received from Steele. 226 FBI officials we interviewed told us that the length of time it took for Steele's election reporting to reach FBI Headquarters was excessive and that the reports should have been sent promptly after their receipt by the Legat. Members of the Crossfire Hurricane team told us that their assessment of the Steele election reporting could have started much earlier if the reporting had been made available to them.` - Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation [link](https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf)
    
## First Carter Page FISA Application
- On 19-21 September 2016, The Crossfire Hurricane team begin the first discussions of a FISA application based on the receipt of the Steele Reporting on Carter Page and are noted as the line of establishing probable cause was crossed based on the Steele Reporting.
    
    - `Also on September 19, the team began discussions with OGC to consider Steele's reporting as part of a FISA application targeting Carter Page. In an email to the OGC Unit Chief and OGC Attorney, the Supervisory Intelligence Analyst (Supervisory Intel Analyst) forwarded an excerpt from Steele's Report 94 ( described in more detail below) concerning Page's alleged secret meeting with Igor Divyekin in July 2016 and asked, "Does this put us at least _that_ much closer to a full FISA on [Carter Page]?" (Emphasis in original). The Supervisory Intel Analyst told us that, earlier that day, he had researched information on Divyekin that "elevated" the significance of this particular allegation. He said that he wondered whether OGC would find that this information, along with the totality of the other information on Carter Page, brought them closer to probable cause on Page. Similarly, Case Agent 1 told us that the team's receipt of the reporting from Steele supplied missing information in terms of what Page may have been doing during his July 2016 visit to Moscow and provided enough information on Page's recent activities that Case Agent 1 thought would satisfy OI.  
    -   
    - Two days later, on September 21, the OGC Attorney and OGC Unit Chief requested a meeting with the OI Unit Chief to discuss, among other things, a potential FISA application targeting Carter Page. The OGC Unit Chief told the OIG that the receipt of the Steele reporting changed her mind on whether they could establish probable cause. She said that although there could be differing opinions, she thought it was a "close call" when they first discussed a FISA targeting Page in August, and that the Steele reporting in September "pushed it over" the line in terms of establishing probable cause. She explained that the Steele reporting presented information that Page had recent contact with the Russians and that this contact was consistent with the information received from the FFG that someone on the campaign had received an offer or suggestion of assistance from the Russians. She said that before the Steele reporting, the FBI did not have information concerning what Page's current activities with the Russians might have been or information suggesting a connection between Page and the FFG information. Similarly, the OGC Attorney told us that he thought probable cause was "probably 50/50" before the Steele reporting; however, in his view, it was a combination of the Steele reporting, Carter Page's historical contacts with Russian intelligence officers, and statements Page made in October 2016 during a consensually monitored meeting with an FBI CHS ( described later in this chapter and in Chapter Ten) just before the FISA application was filed with the court, that made the OGC Attorney comfortable about establishing probable cause.  
    -   
    - On September 21, the OGC attorneys met with the OI Unit Chief and described the reporting from Steele concerning Carter Page that the team had recently received. According to notes of the meeting, the OGC Attorney and OGC Unit Chief told the OI Unit Chief about the allegations contained in the Steele reporting that Page had a secret meeting with a high-level Russian official in July 2016, that Page may have received a Russian dossier on Hillary Clinton, and that there was a "well-developed conspiracy" between associates of the Trump campaign and Russian leadership being managed, in part, by Carter Page. The OI Unit Chief told us that he recalled that the Steele reporting was "what kind of pushed it over the line" in terms of the FBI being ready to pursue FISA authority targeting Page. He recalled thinking that if the information bears out during the drafting process, there would probably be sufficient information to support a FISA application targeting Page. Conversely, he said that without the Steele reporting concerning Page, he would not have thought they could establish probable cause based on the other information the FBI presented at that time (Page's historical contacts with Russia).` - Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation

- On 22 September 2016, a Office of Intelligence Attorney is assigned and receives the first FISA request form.
    
    - `On September 22, the OI Unit Chief assigned a line attorney (OI Attorney) to work on the Carter Page FISA, and he and the OI Attorney met with the OGC Unit Chief to brief the OI Attorney into the case and discuss the essential points for the FISA. The same day, OGC submitted a FISA request form to OI providing, among other things, a description of the factual information to establish probable cause to believe that Carter Page was an agent of a foreign power, the "facilities" to be targeted under the proposed FISA coverage, and the FBI's investigative plan. Case Agent 1 said he prepared the FISA request form, and the OGC Attorney said he may have provided a "very quick review" before sending it to OI. The OGC Attorney told us that the FISA request form was not as "robust" as it could have been because the FBI wanted to submit it to OI as soon as possible.` - Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation [link](https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf)
    
    - `Following receipt of the FISA request form on September 22, the OI Attorney immediately began work on the FISA application, preparing the initial drafts with information provided by the FBI. The preparation and approval process for the application took four weeks to complete. We were told that the application received more attention and scrutiny than the typical FISA application in terms of additional layers of review and the number of high-level officials who read the application. We describe this process in detail below.` - Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation [link](https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf)
    
- On 23 September 2016, a Office of Intelligence Attorney begins making warrant drafts.
    
    - `On or about September 23, the OI Attorney began work on the initial draft FISA application. At this early stage of the drafting process, Evans told us that he instructed the OI Attorney and OI Unit Chief to handle the Carter Page FISA application as they would any other FISA application-to make sure the work was as thorough as possible so that NSD could answer the legal question of whether the facts meet the probable cause standard-and leave any policy questions to the decision makers down the road.` - Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation [link](https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf)
    
- On 12 October 2016, Heads of the Crossfire Hurricane team discuss the concern that Steele may have been hired by the DNC and/or Hillary Clinton.
    
    - `On October 12, 2016, Evans's concerns about Steele were briefed to Comey and McCabe in a meeting attended by at least Priestap, Strzok, Lisa Page, and the OGC Unit Chief. According to notes of the meeting, the group discussed that Evans was concerned Steele may have been hired by someone associated with Hillary Clinton or the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and that the read copy of the FISA application would not be filed with the court that day so that Evans could further assess the potential bias. The notes reflect that the group discussed that Evans was also concerned that the foreign intelligence to be collected through the FISA would not be "worth [the] risk." Following the meeting, the OGC Unit Chief emailed Anderson and the OGC Attorney on October 12 and advised them that the concerns Evans had raised were discussed with Comey and McCabe and that both were "supportive" of moving forward despite those concerns.  
    -   
    - During his OIG interview, Evans told us that he thought he did not raise the concern about the potential value of the collection outweighing the risk until sometime after OI worked through the bias issue with the FBI. According to Evans, he raised on multiple occasions with the FBI, including with Strzok, Lisa Page, and later McCabe, whether seeking FISA authority targeting Carter Page was a good idea, even if the legal standard was met. He explained that he did not see a compelling "upside" to the FISA because Carter Page knew he was under FBI investigation (according to news reports) and was therefore not likely to say anything incriminating over the telephone or in email. On the other hand, Evans saw significant "downside" because the target of the FISA was politically sensitive and the Department would be criticized later if this FISA was ever disclosed publicly. He told the OIG that he thought there was no right or wrong answer to this question, which he characterized as a prudential question of risk vs. reward, but he wanted to make sure he raised the issue for the decision makers to consider. According to Evans, the reactions he received from the FBI to this prudential question were some variations of-we understand your concerns, those are valid points, but if you are telling us it's legal, we cannot pull any punches just because there could be criticism afterward.` - Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation  
    - [link](https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf)
    
- On 19 October 2016, Heads of the Crossfire Hurricane team decide to move forward with the FISA application.
    
    - `According to Evans, McCord said that she would discuss the prudential issue with McCabe, but the discussion did not happen before Evans raised the issue directly with McCabe after a regularly scheduled meeting on October 19. According to Evans, McCabe told Evans on October 19 something to the effect of, "I hear you. I understand. [B]ut we can't pull any punches and we've got to do it, and ... let the chips fall where they may." McCabe told us that he did not recall the specific words he used with Evans, but he believed he conveyed to Evans that the FBI "felt strongly" that the FISA application should move forward. McCabe said that he understood at the time that the FBI would likely be criticized no matter what the team did or did not do, but he believed that the team had to get to the bottom of this potentially serious threat to national security. He said that if the FBI had not sought FISA authority under the circumstances presented here simply because the team was afraid of the "political nature" of the information, the FBI would have failed to do its job.` - Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation [link](https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf)
    
- On 20 October 2016, Comey Signs the first FISA warrant on the surveillance of Carter Page.
    
    - `Comey signed the application on October 20, and the application package was presented to Yates on October 21.` - Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation [link](https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf)
    
- On 21 October 2016, The first FISA warrant is approved on the surveillance of Carter Page.
    
    - `At the request of the FBI, the Department filed four applications with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court FISC seeking FISA authority to conduct electronic surveillance targeting Carter Page: the first application on October 21, 2016, and three renewal applications on January 12, April 7, and June 29, 2017. A different FISC judge considered each application and issued the requested orders, collectively resulting in approximately 11 months of FISA coverage targeting Carter Page from October 21, 2016, to September 22, 2017.` - Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation [link](https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf)
    
## FBI’s Activities to Assess Steele’s Reporting After First Carter Page FISA Application
- On 31 October 2016, Mother Jones published an article titled "A Veteran Spy Has Given the FBI Information Alleging a Russian Operation to Cultivate Donald Trump." which included report 80 of the Steele Dossier provided by Steele.
    
    - `At the end of October 2016, Steele provided a briefing to a Mother Jones reporter in which Steele disclosed that he had provided the FBI with information showing connections between candidate Trump and his campaign and the Russian government. On October 31, 2016, three days after then FBI Director James Comey's public announcement that the FBI was reopening its investigation into then Secretary Clinton's use of a private email server based on the receipt of new evidence, Mother Jones published an article titled "A Veteran Spy Has Given the FBI Information Alleging a Russian Operation to Cultivate Donald Trump." The article described the work of a "well-placed Western intelligence source" with a background in Russian intelligence who was sharing information with the FBI. The article presented information contained in Report 80, and quoted the officer as stating that, based on his interactions with the FBI, "[i]t's quite clear there was or is a pretty substantial inquiry going on."` - Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation [link](https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf)
    
    - `He regularly consults with US government agencies on Russian matters, and near the start of July on his own initiative—without the permission of the US company that hired him—he sent a report he had written for that firm to a contact at the FBI, according to the former intelligence officer and his American associates, who asked not to be identified. (He declines to identify the FBI contact.) The former spy says he concluded that the information he had collected on Trump was “sufficiently serious” to share with the FBI.` [link](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/veteran-spy-gave-fbi-info-alleging-russian-operation-cultivate-donald-trump/)
    
- On 1 November 2016, Steele was closed as a confidential human source for the FBI. Strzok told the OIG that this was because of Steele’s decision to discuss his reporting with the media, namely Mother Jones.
    
    - `members of the Crossfire Hurricane team met with Steele in early October, that the decision to close Steele was "non-negotiable."  
    - Handling Agent 1 finalized the necessary paperwork on November 17, 2016, which stated that Steele was closed on November 1 and was being closed for cause due to his disclosure of his confidential relationship with the FBI to a third party. Strzok told the OIG that the FBI closed Steele "because he was a control problem. We did not close him because we thought he was [a] fabricator." According to Strzok, Steele's decisions to discuss his reporting with the media and to disclose his relationship with the FBI were "horrible and it hurt what we were doing, and no question, he shouldn't have done it."  
    -   
    - As a consequence of his closing, Handling Agent 1 halted payment of $15,000 to Steele. Handling Agent 1 told the OIG that the FBI never paid Steele for information related to the 2016 U.S. elections. FBI records show that Steele's last payment occurred on August 12, 2016, and was for information furnished to the FBl's Cyber and Counterintelligence Divisions (CD) that was unrelated to the 2016 U.S. elections.` - Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation

## Three Renewals of Carter Page FISA Application
- On 12 January 2017, The first FISA application renewal is approved on the surveillance of Carter Page.
    
    - `At the request of the FBI, the Department filed four applications with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court FISC seeking FISA authority to conduct electronic surveillance targeting Carter Page: the first application on October 21, 2016, and three renewal applications on January 12, April 7, and June 29, 2017.

## Errors in Carter Page FISA Renewal Application
- > `` - Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation [link](https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf)
    
- Horowitz concluded that the review did not find evidence that `political bias or improper motivation influenced the FBI's decision to seek FISA authority on Carter Page`.
    
    - `As noted above, in the OIG's June 2018 report, Review of Various Actions in Advance of the 2016 Election, we described text messages between Peter Strzok and Lisa Page discussing statements of hostility toward then candidate Trump and statements of support for candidate Clinton. Several of these text messages appeared to mix political opinions with discussions about the investigation into candidate Clinton's email use and refer to the Crossfire Hurricane investigation. As part of our review of the Carter Page FISA applications, we sought to determine whether there was evidence that Strzok or Page affected the preparation of or decision to file any of the applications. As described in Chapter Five, Strzok approved the request to expedite the FISA application proposed by the Crossfire Hurricane team, and he and Lisa Page communicated with Department officials, as did other FBI officials, in an effort to move the first application forward. This included conversations with NSD officials during which Strzok expressed frustration that the FISA process was not moving forward at the pace desired by the FBI. However, testimonial and documentary evidence we reviewed established that Strzok and Lisa Page played no role in the substantive preparation or approval of any of the four FISA applications, including the Woods process. We did not find documentary or testimonial evidence that political bias or improper motivation influenced the FBI's decision to seek FISA authority on Carter Page.` - Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation [link](https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf)
    
- Horowitz concluded that the review did find 17 `significant inaccuracies and omissions` in the FBI's four FISA applications made to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to obtain warrants for the surveillance of Page.
    
    - `Nevertheless, we found that members of the Crossfire Hurricane team failed to meet the basic obligation to ensure that the Carter Page FISA applications were "scrupulously accurate." We identified significant inaccuracies and omissions in each of the four applications-7 in the first FISA application and a total of 17 by the final renewal application. For example, the Crossfire Hurricane team obtained information from Steele's Primary Sub-source in January 2017 that raised significant questions about the reliability of the Steele reporting that was used in the Carter Page FISA applications. But members of the Crossfire Hurricane team failed to share the information with the Department, and it was therefore omitted from the second and third renewal applications. All of the applications also omitted information the FBI had obtained from another U.S. government agency detailing its prior relationship with Page, including that Page had been approved as an operational contact for the other agency from 2008 to 2013, and that Page had provided information to the other agency concerning his prior contacts with certain Russian intelligence officers, one of which overlapped with facts asserted in the FISA application.  
    -   
    - As a result of the 17 significant inaccuracies and omissions we identified, relevant information was not shared with, and consequently not considered by, important Department decision makers and the court, and the FISA applications made it appear as though the evidence supporting probable cause was stronger than was actually the case. We also found basic, fundamental, and serious errors during the completion of the FBI's factual accuracy reviews, known as the Woods Procedures, which are designed to ensure that FISA applications contain a full and accurate presentation of the facts.` - Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation  
    - [link](https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf)
    
- Horowitz concluded that the review highlighted `serious performance failures` reflected badly on `the FBI chain of command's management and supervision` of the FISA processes.
    
    - `As noted throughout this report, Case Agent 1 was primarily responsible for some of the most significant errors and omissions in the FISA applications, including (1) the mischaracterization of Steele's prior reporting resulting from his failure to seek review and approval of the statement from the handling agent, as the Woods Procedures required, (2) the failure to advise OI of Papadopoulos's statements to FBI CHSs that were inconsistent with the Steele reporting relied upon in the FISA applications that there was a "well-developed conspiracy of cooperation" between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and Russia, (3) the failure to advise OI of Page's statements to an FBI CHS regarding him having no communications with Manafort and denying the alleged meetings with Sechin and Divyekin, ( 4) providing inaccurate and incomplete information to OI about information provided by another U.S. government agency regarding its past relationship with Page that was highly relevant to the applications, (5) the failure to advise OI of the information from Bruce Ohr about Steele and his election reporting, and (6) the failure to advise OI of the inconsistences between Steele and his Primary Sub-source. The explanations that Case Agent 1 provided for these errors and omissions are summarized in Chapter Five and Chapter Eight of this report. While we found no documentary or testimonial evidence that this pattern of errors by Case Agent 1 was intentional, we also did not find his explanations for so many significant and repeated failures to be satisfactory. We therefore concluded that these explanations did not excuse his failure to meet his responsibility to ensure that the initial FISA application, the first renewal application, and the third renewal application were "scrupulously accurate."  
    -   
    - We similarly found errors by supervisory FBI employees with responsibility for the accuracy of the FBI applications. For example, SSA 1 performed the supervisory accuracy review for the first application required under the Woods Procedures and did not correct the errors we identified before the application was filed. We found that the team "speculated" that Steele's prior reporting had been corroborated and used in criminal proceedings, but did not take reasonable steps to ensure the accuracy of this statement and did not confirm that Handling Agent 1 had reviewed and approved its content, as required by the Woods Procedures. Separately, SSA 3 and SSA 5 failed to correct all of the errors we identified in the renewal applications, as did Case Agent 1 and Case Agent 7, when they performed the accuracy review under the Woods Procedures for one or more of the renewals.

    - These failures by supervisory and non-supervisory agents represent serious performance failures. 499 However, as we next discuss, the breadth and significance of these and other errors raised broader concerns as well.` - Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation

    - `These errors and omissions resulted from case agents providing wrong or incomplete information to OI and failing to flag important issues for discussion, without any satisfactory explanations. Moreover, case agents and SSAs did not give equal attention or treatment to the relevant facts that did not support probable cause, or reassess the evidence supporting probable cause as the investigation progressed and the information gathered undercut the assertions in the FISA applications. Further, the agents and SSAs did not follow, or appear to even know, the requirements in the Woods Procedures to re-verify the factual assertions from previous applications that are repeated in renewal applications and verify source characterization statements with the CHS handling agent and document the verification in the Woods File. That so many basic and fundamental errors were made on four FISA applications by three separate, hand-picked teams, on one of the most sensitive FBI investigations that was briefed to the highest levels within the FBI and that FBI officials expected would eventually be subjected to close scrutiny, raised significant questions regarding the FBI chain of command's management and supervision of the FISA process.` - Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation [link](https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf)
    
- Horowitz concluded that the first FISA application had omitted information about Page working for the CIA.
    
    - `Toward that end, on September 28, 2016, the OI Attorney emailed Case Agent 1 a draft of the FISA application, copying other members of the Crossfire Hurricane team. In a comment in the draft application, the OI Attorney asked "do we know if there is any truth to Page's claim that he has provided information to [another U.S. government agency]-was he considered a source/asset/whatever?" In response to the OI Attorney's question, on September 29, Case Agent 1 inserted the following comment in the draft:  
    -   
    - "He did meet with [the other U.S. government agency], however, it's dated and I would argue it was/is outside scope, I don't think we need it in. It was years ago, when he was in Moscow. If you want to keep it, I can get the language from the [August 17 Memorandum] we were provided [by the other U.S. government agency]."  
    -   
    - Based upon this response, the OI Attorney did not include information about Page's prior relationship with the other agency in the FISA application.  
    -   
    - However, the information Case Agent 1 provided to the OI Attorney was inaccurate. As described in the August 17 Memorandum from the other U.S. government agency to the FBI, Page first met with the other agency in April 2008, after he left Moscow (Page had lived in Moscow from 2004 to 2007), and he had been approved as an operational contact for the other agency from 2008 to 2013. Additionally, rather than being outside the scope of the FISA application, the FISA application included allegations about meetings that Page had with Russian intelligence officers that Page had disclosed to the other agency. Specifically, according to the August 17 Memorandum, Page provided information to the other agency in October 2010 about contacts he had with a Russian intelligence officer (Intelligence Officer 1), which the other agency assessed likely began in 2008. Page's contacts with Intelligence Officer 1 in 2007 and 2008 were among the historical connections to Russian intelligence officers that the FBI relied upon in the first FISA application (and subsequent renewal applications) to help support probable cause. The August 17 Memorandum stated that Page told the other agency that he met with Intelligence Officer 1 four times, characterized him as a "compelling, nice guy," and described Intelligence Officer l's alleged interest in contacting an identified U.S. person. According to the August 17 Memorandum, the employee of the other U.S. government agency who met with Page assessed that Page "candidly described his contact with" Intelligence Officer 1. Page's relationship with the other agency was not mentioned in any of the four FISA applications.` - Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation

    - `On Aug. 17, the CIA advised the FBI in writing that Page had been an “operational contact” from 2008 to 2013, the inspector general found, which meant that the agency could ask Page questions about things he may have learned in the normal course of his activities, but could not assign him to go out and gather information. The report does not identify the agency by name, but it was the CIA, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive issue.  
    -   
    - Page, the agency said, had previously provided information about his contacts with Russian intelligence officers. That was potentially an important fact because if Page had been telling the CIA about those Russian contacts, that might make him seem less suspicious to the FBI.  
    -   
    - The inspector general found no evidence that the Crossfire Hurricane team asked for more information about Page’s relationship with the CIA before asking a court for a surveillance warrant to monitor him.`
