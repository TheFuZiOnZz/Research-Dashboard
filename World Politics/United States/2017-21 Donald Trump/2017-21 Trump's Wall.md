- As a promise during his last campaign, it seems it's been nothing but disaster for Trump regarding the issue. Trump promised to build a wall along the border's entire 2,000-mile length. Trump signed a declaration of National Emergency, saying that the situation at the U.S.–Mexico border is a crisis requiring money allocated for other purposes to be used to build the wall.

- A major premise of the wall was that `Mexico would pay for the wall`. On Day 6 of Trump’s administration, the Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto rejected the idea that Mexico would pay for any border wall between the United States and his country.

- Not very much has been built of it, On December 17, 2019, acting Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection Mark Morgan stated that 93 miles of new wall has been built during the Trump administration; according to CBP figures, at least 90 miles of that replaced existing structures.

- On September 1, 2020, The U.S. Customs and Border Protection then updated the number to 321 Miles. This is still only 16% of the wall from the previous 4.7% at the end of 2019. [link](https://www.cbp.gov/border-security/along-us-borders/border-wall-system)
- On November 16, 2020, The U.S. Customs and Border Protection then updated the number to 402 Miles. This is still only 20% of the wall from the previous 16% on September 1, 2020. [link](https://www.cbp.gov/border-security/along-us-borders/border-wall-system)
- Trump wanted to build the wall to keep out illegal immigrants crossing the southern border. Why when the number of Mexican immigrants living in the U.S. illegally has declined by 2 million since 2007. In 2017, 4.9 million unauthorized immigrants from Mexico lived in the U.S., down from a peak of 6.9 million in 2007. Mexicans now make up fewer than half of the nation’s 10.5 million unauthorized immigrants (47% in 2017).

- Not only this but at the U.S.-Mexico border, there have been more apprehensions of non-Mexicans than Mexicans every year since fiscal 2016. Non-Mexicans accounted for 62% of apprehensions at the southwest border in fiscal 2018, [link](https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2019-Mar/bp-total-apps-other-mexico-fy2000-fy2018.pdf) marking the third consecutive year in which they outnumbered Mexicans. In fiscal 2018, which ended Sept. 30, the Border Patrol made 152,257 apprehensions of Mexicans. This is a sharp drop from a recent peak of 1.6 million apprehensions in fiscal 2000, when Mexicans accounted for 98% of apprehensions. The decline in apprehensions reflects a decrease in the number of unauthorized Mexican immigrants coming to the U.S. [link](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/06/28/what-we-know-about-illegal-immigration-from-mexico/)
- The Department of Homeland Security records that most undocumented immigrants didn't enter this country through the southern border. About 660,000 travelers to the United States overstayed their visas in fiscal 2018, the most recent year for which the Department of Homeland Security has published figures. DHS estimated that, as of Sept. 30, 2018, the end of that fiscal year, more than 560,000 of those travelers were still in the U.S. [link](https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/19_0417_fy18-entry-and-exit-overstay-report.pdf)
- So why did Trump want to build the wall? Trump said `I think much of the drugs — the big loads of drugs, and certainly the human traffickers, go not through the ports of entry; they go through the open areas where they don’t have walls. These folks know that better than anybody.` [link](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-briefing-drug-trafficking-southern-border/)
- CBP statistics show 81 percent of the 265,500 pounds of hard drugs caught at the U.S.-Mexico border from fiscal year 2012 to fiscal year 2016 were stopped by customs officers at ports of entry, rather than by Border Patrol agents working in the desert and wilderness between ports.

- Even if a wall could stop all drugs from Mexico, America’s drug problem would be far from over. The U.S. Centers on Disease Control and Prevention says about 40 percent of opioid deaths in 2016 involved prescription painkillers. Those drugs are made by pharmaceutical companies. Some feed the addiction of people who have prescriptions; others are stolen and sold on the black market. Moreover, illicit versions of powerful synthetic opioids such as fentanyl have come to the U.S. from China.
