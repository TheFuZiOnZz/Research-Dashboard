### 2020 Trump Suggesting Use of Disinfectant and Light solution
- During the April 23 briefing, DHS Science and Technology Directorate William N. Bryan presented preliminary findings from lab experiments conducted by the Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, which found that COVID-19's half-life in saliva droplets on a non-porous surface was shorter when exposed to heightened heat or humidity, and considerably shortened in ultraviolet light (such as direct sunlight). Bryan noted that this evidence could help `support practical decision-making` (such as having governments encourage more outdoor activity by residents), but that `it would be irresponsible for us to say summer will kill the virus`.
- On April 24, Trump made a comment in that day's daily Corona Press conference to one of his advisors, Dr. Deborah Birx, on both light or UV light from inside and outside the body as well as injecting disinfectant.

- On April 25, Trump then said these comments in response to a question regarding said comments were ‘Sarcastic’ because ‘of reporters like you’ [link](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/warnings-trump-suggesting-disinfectant-ingestion-deadly-wh-claims/story?id=70328631) Trump then later tweeted that he wasn’t speaking to Dr. Deborah Birx `Wrong, I was speaking to our Laboratory expert, not Deborah, about sunlight etc. & the CoronaVirus.` [link](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1254145835450933249) this is absolutely false as the tape shows him asking questions directly to Dr. Deborah Birx. [link](https://youtu.be/Cpcxbq_Anuc) Trump then went on to say that disinfectant `would kill [the virus] on the hands, and that would make things much better.` [link](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/warnings-trump-suggesting-disinfectant-ingestion-deadly-wh-claims/story?id=70328631) However, applying disinfectants on skin has the potential to cause irritation or chemical burns.

- Trump’s suggestion involving the injection of disinfectants faced strong criticism from health experts, who stated that doing so would be dangerous and lethal. Reckitt Benckiser, the manufacturer of Lysol, issued a warning against use of its products internally.
