### Trump's Mass deportation of illegal immigrants
- In August 2015, during his campaign, Trump proposed the mass deportation of illegal aliens as a part of his immigration policy.

- Such a program would also impose a fiscal cost; the fiscally conservative American Action Forum policy group estimates that deporting every illegal immigrant would cause a slump of $381.5 billion to $623.2 billion in private sector output, amounting to roughly a loss of 2% of U.S. GDP.

- In a Cato Report, using US Census Data from the American Community Survey, titled `Criminal Immigrants: Their Numbers, Demographics, and Countries of Origin,` even illegal immigrants commit less crime than natives with .84% of them being incarcerated compared to 1.53% of the native population.

- In a Pew Research study, it also seems as if they were almost better off not integrating as second generation immigrants are observed to commit a fraction less crime than native born but more likely to commit crime compared to first generation immigrants.

- `Stephen Goss, the chief actuary of the Social Security Administration (SSA), told VICE News that an estimated 7 million people are currently working in the US illegally. Of those, he estimates that about 3.1 million are using fake or expired social security numbers, yet also paying automatic payroll taxes. Goss believes that these workers pay an annual net contribution of $12 billion to the Social Security Trust Fund.` [link](https://news.vice.com/article/unauthorized-immigrants-paid-100-billion-into-social-security-over-last-decade)
- They contribute in countless ways to our communities, workforce, and economy. In 2015, the IRS collected $23.6 billion from 4.4 million workers without Social Security numbers–many of whom were undocumented. [link](https://www.vox.com/2018/4/13/17229018/undocumented-immigrants-pay-taxes)
- Biden is in support of `Restore and defend the naturalization process for green card holders. A Biden Administration will streamline and improve the naturalization process to make it more accessible to qualified green card holders. The Trump Administration has made it far too difficult for qualifying green card holders to obtain citizenship. Quite simply, this is wrong. Biden will restore faith in the citizenship process by removing roadblocks to naturalization and obtaining the right to vote, addressing the application backlog by prioritizing the adjudication workstream and ensuring applications are processed quickly, and rejecting the imposition of unreasonable fees.` [link](https://joebiden.com/immigration/)
- Biden is in support of `Creates a roadmap to citizenship for the nearly 11 million people who have been living in and strengthening our country for years. These are our mothers, fathers, brothers, and sisters. They are our neighbors, co-workers, and members of our congregations and Little League teams. They contribute in countless ways to our communities, workforce, and economy. In 2015, the IRS collected $23.6 billion from 4.4 million workers without Social Security numbers–many of whom were undocumented. Biden will aggressively advocate for legislation that creates a clear roadmap to legal status and citizenship for unauthorized immigrants who register, are up-to-date on their taxes, and have passed a background check.` [link](https://joebiden.com/immigration/)
- Biden is in support of `Provides a path to legalization for agricultural workers who have worked for years on U.S. farms and continue to work in agriculture. Securing adequate, seasonal help in the agricultural sector can be inefficient and difficult to navigate, causing people to avoid or exploit the system, even when jobs remain unfilled. Biden supports compromise legislation between farmworkers and the agricultural sector that will provide legal status based on prior agricultural work history, and a faster-track to a green card and ultimately citizenship.` [link](https://joebiden.com/immigration/)
