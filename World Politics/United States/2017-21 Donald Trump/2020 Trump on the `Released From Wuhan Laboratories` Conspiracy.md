### 2020 Trump on the `Released From Wuhan Laboratories` Conspiracy
- Trump said that he has seen evidence linking the novel coronavirus to a lab in Wuhan, China, without providing further details. [link](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/495571-trump-says-he-has-seen-evidence-linking-coronavirus-to-wuhan-lab)
- In February, Republican Senator Tom Cotton speculated that the coronavirus outbreak might have come out of a Chinese lab in Wuhan. Also implied that China may have deliberately allowed the evidence to spread. WHO rejects this explicitly.

- Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease and perhaps the single most prominent doctor in the world at the moment, In an interview with National Geographic posted on Monday night, [link](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/05/anthony-fauci-no-scientific-evidence-the-coronavirus-was-made-in-a-chinese-lab-cvd/\#close) Fauci was definitive about the origins of the virus which has sickened more than a million Americans and killed more than 68,000, `If you look at the evolution of the virus in bats and what's out there now, [the scientific evidence] is very, very strongly leaning toward this could not have been artificially or deliberately manipulated ... Everything about the stepwise evolution over time strongly indicates that [this virus] evolved in nature and then jumped species.` [link](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/05/05/politics/fauci-trump-coronavirus-wuhan-lab/index.html)
- There had also been claims that Coronavius originated and was transmitted from bats. This theory broke from Shi Zhengli, a 55-year-old scientist who had been looking to make a mark on bat-linked virology, an area to which she has dedicated her life. For years, Ms Shi has collected strains of coronaviruses from bats. In 2004, she identified a reservoir for such diseases in bat caves in Yunnan province in southern China and she has been at the forefront of research on how viruses such as Sars may have jumped to humans. Because of this, she has been dubbed the name, `batwoman`. [link](https://www.ft.com/content/255a3524-0459-4724-a92a-58268ab627e2)
- The U.S. intelligence community said it agreed with the scientific consensus that the virus was not `manmade or genetically modified` but confirmed that officials are investigating whether the outbreak began through contact with animals or as a result of a lab accident in Wuhan.

- Edward Holmes, an Australian virologist who helped map and share the genetic sequence of the virus, said there was no evidence that Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19 in humans, originated in a Wuhan laboratory. `if the adaptive process occurred in humans, then even if repeated zoonotic transfers occur, they are unlikely to take off without the same series of mutations` He said the closest known relative of Sars-Cov-2 was a bat virus named RaTG13, which was indeed kept at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. But he added the bat virus, which was sampled in Yunnan province, had a level of genome sequence divergence from coronavirus equivalent to at least 20-50 years of evolutionary change. Thus, he does not believe it was responsible for Covid-19. Prof Holmes, who in 2014 visited the Wuhan live animal market that Chinese authorities have said was the source of the disease, argues the most likely origin of the virus is that it jumped from wildlife to new hosts.
