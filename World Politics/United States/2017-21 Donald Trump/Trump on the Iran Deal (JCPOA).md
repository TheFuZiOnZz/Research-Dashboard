- Vox covered the Iran deal in 9 graphics. Every aspect of the deal that wanted to limit Iran in its nuclear supplies successfully carried out its requirements. `The nuclear deal prohibits Iran from possessing any uranium that’s more than 3.67 percent U-235, and prohibits it from having more than 660 pounds of enriched uranium (about 97 percent less than it had prior to the deal). Iran is fully complying with these restrictions.`,`Prior to the deal, Iran had close to 20,000 centrifuges at its uranium enrichment facilities, Natanz and Fordow. Under the deal’s terms, Iran can only enrich at Natanz, and can only operate a maximum of 5,060 older-model centrifuges (rather than newer, more efficient ones). Iran is fully complying with these restrictions.`,`Iran has such a reactor in Arak; the deal requires Iran not to operate the facility and to redesign it such that it will not produce fissile material if operated. Iran is fully complying with these restrictions.` [link](https://www.vox.com/world/2018/5/8/17328858/iran-nuclear-deal-trump-announcement-chart)
- Biden spoke in Manhattan on these tensions with Iran — and called on Trump to rejoin the Iran deal amid increasing tensions over the killing of Major General Qassim Suleimani. “The seeds of danger were planted by Donald Trump himself on May 8, 2019 — the day he tore up the Iran Nuclear Deal, against the advice of his own top master security adviser,” said Biden during his speech. “He turned his back on our closest European allies and decided that it was important to destroy any progress that the Obama-Biden administration did.” [link](https://www.amny.com/manhattan/in-manhattan-biden-urges-trump-to-restore-iran-deal-and-diffuse-tension/)
