### 2018 `Spygate` Conspiracy

- Spygate is a conspiracy theory initiated by Trump in May 2018 that the Obama administration had placed a spy in his 2016 presidential campaign for political purposes.
### 2019 Trump-Ukraine Controversy, 1st Impeachment
- [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump%E2%80%93Ukraine_scandal)
- [[video]](https://youtu.be/BD3my03ioio)
- On 9 May 2019, it was reported that Rudy Giuliani planned a trip to Ukraine to push for inquiries that could help Trump.
    
    - `Mr. Giuliani’s plans create the remarkable scene of a lawyer for the president of the United States pressing a foreign government to pursue investigations that Mr. Trump’s allies hope could help him in his re-election campaign. And it comes after Mr. Trump spent more than half of his term facing questions about whether his 2016 campaign conspired with a foreign power.  
    -   
    - “We’re not meddling in an election, we’re meddling in an investigation, which we have a right to do,” Mr. Giuliani said in an interview on Thursday when asked about the parallel to the special counsel’s inquiry.  
    -   
    - “There’s nothing illegal about it,” he said. “Somebody could say it’s improper. And this isn’t foreign policy — I’m asking them to do an investigation that they’re doing already and that other people are telling them to stop. And I’m going to give them reasons why they shouldn’t stop it because that information will be very, very helpful to my client, and may turn out to be helpful to my government.”  
    -   
    - Mr. Giuliani’s planned trip, which has not been previously reported, is part of a monthslong effort by the former New York mayor and a small group of Trump allies working to build interest in the Ukrainian inquiries. Their motivation is to try to discredit the special counsel’s investigation; undermine the case against Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump’s imprisoned former campaign chairman; and potentially to damage Mr. Biden, the early front-runner for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.`

- On 11 May 2019, Rudy Giuliani cancelled a trip to Ukraine one day after saying he would be, "meddling in an investigation" and giving Ukraine's new government," quote, "reasons why they shouldn't stop it because that information will be "very very helpful to my client,".
    
    - `Facing withering attacks accusing him of seeking foreign assistance for President Trump’s re-election campaign, Rudolph W. Giuliani announced on Friday night that he had canceled a trip to Kiev in which he planned to push the incoming Ukrainian government to press ahead with investigations that he hoped would benefit Mr. Trump.  
    -   
    - Mr. Giuliani, President Trump’s personal lawyer, explained that he felt as if he was being “set up” by Ukrainians critical of his efforts, and he blamed Democrats for trying to “spin” the trip.  
    -   
    - “They say I was meddling in the election — ridiculous — but that’s their spin,” he said.`

### FBIs Attempt To Spy on Clinton Campaign
- The FBI encouraged a Confidential Human Source to infiltrate the Clinton campaign to attempt to entrap Hilary Clinton
    
    - `According to CHS-A, Insider-I, on behalf of Foreign Govemment-3, sought access through CHS-A, to a Clinton campaign fundraising event in the Fall of 2015. Although CHSA was initially advised by an individual associated with the fundraising efforts that Insider-1 could attend, that individual consulted with the campaign and disinvited Insider-1 to the event because of the perceived negative attention a foreign national might attract. According to CHS-A, the fundraising contact suggested CHS-A schedule a separate meeting for Insider-1. Field Office-I renewed the OIA from late 2014 for the CHS to attend the late November 2015 event and make introductions on behalf of Insider-I, but ultimately CHS-A did not attend the event.` - Durham Report [link](https://www.justice.gov/storage/durhamreport.pdf)

### 2020 Election `Fraud` Conspiracy, 2nd Impeachment
[link](https://youtu.be/-QiSWnvrb24?t=2358)
[link](https://www.thetrumparchive.com/)
### Pre-Election
- On 7 April 2020, President Trump first made suggestions to the media that widespread electoral fraud would occur during the 2020 Election especially through the use of mail-in ballots.
    
    - `"Mail ballots — they cheat. OK? People cheat," he said April 7. "There's a lot of dishonesty going along with mail-in voting."`  
    -   
    - ...  
    -   
    - `"Mail ballots are a very dangerous thing for this country, because they're cheaters. They go and collect them. They're fraudulent in many cases,” Trump said April 7.`  
    - [link](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-pushes-false-claims-about-mail-vote-fraud-here-are-n1180566)
    
- On 8 April 2020, President Trump tweeted in response to the Republican silence accusing Democrats of stoking voter fraud
    
    - `Republicans should fight very hard when it comes to state wide mail-in voting. Democrats are clamoring for it. Tremendous potential for voter fraud, and for whatever reason, doesn’t work out well for Republicans. @foxandfriends` [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20200408122052/https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1247861952736526336)
    
- On 8 April 2020, President Trump tweeted about the alleged difference in Absentee Ballots and Mail-In Ballots.
    
    - `Absentee Ballots are a great way to vote for the many senior citizens, military, and others who can’t get to the polls on Election Day. These ballots are very different from 100% Mail-In Voting, which is “RIPE for FRAUD,” and shouldn’t be allowed!` [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20200531223135/https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1248031484532928514)
    
- On 11 April 2020, President Trump tweeted,
    
    - `Mail in ballots substantially increases the risk of crime and VOTER FRAUD!` [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20200902054032/https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1249132374547464193)
    
- On 19 July 2020, Trump refused to say whether he would accept the results of the election and commit to a peaceful transition of power if he lost.
    
    - `In the “Fox News Sunday” interview, Wallace asked Trump whether he considers himself a “gracious” loser. Trump replied that he doesn’t like to lose, then added: “It depends. I think mail-in voting is going to rig the election. I really do.” Trump’s comment echoed unfounded claims he has made in recent weeks that mail-in voting is susceptible to widespread fraud. “Are you suggesting that you might not accept the results of the election?” Wallace asked. Trump responded, “No. I have to see.” Later in the interview, pressed on whether he will accept the results of the November election, Trump again declined to say.` [link](https://archive.ph/CItzx)
    
- On 12 August 2020, the House of Representatives voted for a $25 billion grant to the U.S. Postal Service for the expected surge in mail voting, Trump blocked funding, saying he wanted to prevent any increase in voting by mail.
    
    - `Trump, who has been railing against mail-in balloting for months, said the cash-strapped agency’s enlarged role in the November election would perpetuate “one of the greatest frauds in history.” Speaking Wednesday at his daily pandemic news briefing, Trump said he would not approve $25 billion in emergency funding for the Postal Service, or $3.5 billion in supplemental funding for election resources, citing prohibitively high costs. “They don’t have the money to do the universal mail-in voting. So therefore, they can’t do it, I guess,” Trump said. “Are they going to do it even if they don’t have the money?”` [link](https://archive.ph/Ug1yL)
    
- On 23 September 2020, Trump again refused to say whether he would accept the results of the election and commit to a peaceful transition of power if he lost.
    
    - `"Well, we're going to have to see what happens," Trump said when asked whether he'd commit to a peaceful transition, one of the cornerstones of American democracy.  
    -   
    - ...  
    -   
    - "You know that I've been complaining very strongly about the ballots and the ballots are a disaster," Trump said at a press briefing at the White House,  
    -   
    - ...  
    -   
    - "(G)et rid of the ballots and you'll have a very ... there won't be a transfer, frankly. There'll be a continuation," he added, saying "the ballots are out of control."`

- On 24 Septem­ber 2020, The FBI Director, Chris­topher Wray, before the U.S. Senate Commit­tee on Home­land Secur­ity and Government Affairs said that:
    
    - `We have not seen, histor­ic­ally, any kind of coordin­ated national voter fraud effort in a major elec­tion, whether it’s by mail or other­wise.` [[fbihasnotseenevidenceofwidespreadvot]]
    
- On 30 October 2020, President Trump tweeted,
    
    - `The Election should end on November 3rd., not weeks later!` [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20201030214840/https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1322294301183782912)
    
### Peri-Election
- On 3 November 2020, Election Day starts.
- On 4 & 5 November 2020, More than 200 Trump supporters protest at a Maricopa County, Arizona elections center and around downtown Phoenix, claiming some ballots have not been properly counted.
    
    - `Tensions are running high outside of the Maricopa County Elections office in Phoenix, Ariz., where more than a hundred protestors have demonstrated for the last three nights to argue about the electoral process after former Vice President Joe Biden became the front-runner in the traditionally red state.` [link](https://time.com/5908628/maricopa-county-arizona-protests/)
    
- On 5 November 2020, Trump Tweeted:
    
    - `STOP THE COUNT!` [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20201105153104/https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1324353932022480896)
    
- On 5 November 2020, Trump Tweeted:

- On 5 November 2020, Trump claimed that the election was being stolen from him.
    
    - `“If you count the legal votes, I easily win. If you count the illegal votes, they can try to steal the election from us. If you count the votes that came in late, we’re looking at them very strongly,” Trump told reporters.  
    -   
    - ...  
    -   
    - “Media polling was election interference, in the truest sense of that word by powerful special interests. These, really, phony polls … were designed to keep our voters at home, create the illusion of momentum for Mr. Biden and diminish republicans ability to raise funds. They were what’s called suppression polls,” Trump said.`

- On 7 November 2020, AP news called the 2020 Election in favour of Joe Biden.
    
    - `On Saturday, Biden captured the presidency when The Associated Press declared him the victor in his native Pennsylvania at 11:25 a.m. EST. That got him the state’s 20 electoral votes, which pushed him over the 270 electoral-vote threshold needed to prevail.` [link](https://apnews.com/article/why-did-AP-call-election-for-Biden-fe79276cd9175fffc7cf4fb58045fcf9)
    
### Post-Election
- On 9 November 2020, The administrator of the General Services Administration refuses to sign a letter allowing Biden's transition team to formally begin work, reflecting Trump's position of not conceding yet.
    
    - `A Trump administration appointee is refusing to sign a letter allowing President-elect Joe Biden’s transition team to formally begin its work this week, in another sign the incumbent president has not acknowledged Biden’s victory and could disrupt the transfer of power.` [link](https://archive.ph/HfGpV)
    
- On 12 November 2020, The Trump-Appointed Commis­sioner of the U.S. Elec­tion Assist­ance Commis­sion, Benjamin Hovland said that,
    
    - `You know, we've seen allegations like this before, and essentially, time and time again, when the rubber hits the road, there's no evidence — whether that's in court cases, whether that's in the presidential commission that was created in 2017 to find the alleged non-citizens fraud after the 2016 election that cost, in his mind, the president the popular vote, but found nothing and disbanded in embarrassment, or academic studies. We never see evidence of widespread voter fraud. And there's no indicators that 2020 will be different in that regard.` [link](https://www.businessinsider.com/nations-chief-election-administrator-calls-trumps-voting-fraud-claims-shameful-2020-11?r=US&IR=T)
    
- On 12 November 2020, The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency released the following statement:
    
    - `“The November 3rd election was the most secure in American history. Right now, across the country, election officials are reviewing and double checking the entire election process prior to finalizing the result. “When states have close elections, many will recount ballots. All of the states with close results in the 2020 presidential race have paper records of each vote, allowing the ability to go back and count each ballot if necessary. This is an added benefit for security and resilience. This process allows for the identification and correction of any mistakes or errors. There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised. “Other security measures like pre-election testing, state certification of voting equipment, and the U.S. Election Assistance Commission’s (EAC) certification of voting equipment help to build additional confidence in the voting systems used in 2020. “While we know there are many unfounded claims and opportunities for misinformation about the process of our elections, we can assure you we have the utmost confidence in the security and integrity of our elections, and you should too. When you have questions, turn to elections officials as trusted voices as they administer elections.”` [link](https://www.cisa.gov/news/2020/11/12/joint-statement-elections-infrastructure-government-coordinating-council-election)
    
- On 11 December 2020, Attorney General William Barr said to AP news that there is no evidence of widespread election fraud that Trump is claiming.
    
    - `Although Justice’s U.S. attorneys and FBI agents had been working to follow up specific complaints they’d received, Barr told Balsamo: “To date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election.” The Dec. 1 statement was a direct contradiction to Trump and his allies who have kept up baseless arguments about a rigged election, despite the electoral college tally and popular vote loss to Democrat Joe Biden.` [link](https://leads.ap.org/best-of-the-week/exclusive-interview-with-attorney-general-barr-nets-massive-scoop)
    
- On 2 January 2021, during an hour-long conference call, Trump pressured Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to change the state's election results citing that Trump wanted to find 11,780 votes.
    
    - `Now the problem is they need more time for the big numbers. But they’re very substantial numbers. But I think you’re going to find that they — by the way, a little information — I think you’re going to find that they are shredding ballots because they have to get rid of the ballots because the ballots are unsigned. The ballots are corrupt, and they’re brand new, and they don’t have seals, and there’s a whole thing with the ballots. But the ballots are corrupt. And you are going to find that they are — which is totally illegal — it is more illegal for you than it is for them because, you know, what they did and you’re not reporting it. That’s a criminal, that’s a criminal offense. And you can’t let that happen. That’s a big risk to you and to Ryan, your lawyer. And that’s a big risk. But they are shredding ballots, in my opinion, based on what I’ve heard. And they are removing machinery, and they’re moving it as fast as they can, both of which are criminal finds. And you can’t let it happen, and you are letting it happen. You know, I mean, I’m notifying you that you’re letting it happen. So look. All I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have because we won the state.` [link](https://archive.ph/BMC7Q)
    
- Trump might have violated Title 52 of the United States Code when he said "I just want to find 11,780 votes” by trying to intimidating election officials to change the results
    
    - `The University of Richmond law professor Carl Tobias said Trump might be “in legal jeopardy after Biden is inaugurated”. In an email to the Guardian, he wrote: “For example, if the justice department or US attorneys believe that Trump violated federal law, or if local prosecutors in states such as Arizona, Georgia, Michigan and Wisconsin, where Trump may have engaged in similar behaviour with state or local election officials, believe that Trump violated state election laws, the federal or state prosecutors could file suit against Trump.” Richard H Pildes, a constitutional law professor at New York University, told the Washington Post: “The president is either knowingly attempting to coerce state officials into corrupting the integrity of the election or is so deluded that he believes what he’s saying.” Trump’s actions may have violated federal statutes, he said. Michael R Bromwich, a former federal prosecutor in the US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, wrote: “Unless there are portions of the tape that somehow negate criminal intent, ‘I just want to find 11,780 votes’ and his threats against Raffensperger and his counsel violate 52 U.S. Code 20511.”` [link](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/04/trumps-phone-call-to-brad-raffensperger-five-key-points)

### Intelligence Community Report
- On 15 March 2021, The Office of the Director of National Intelligence declassified and released a report on `Foreign Threats to the 2020 US Federal Elections`
    
    - `Throughout the election cycle, Russia's online influence actors sought to affect US public perceptions of the candidates, as well as advance Moscow's longstanding goals of undermining confidence in US election processes and increasing sociopolitical divisions among the American people. During the presidential primaries and dating back to 2019, these actors backed candidates from both major US political parties that Moscow viewed as outsiders, while later claiming that election fraud helped what they called "establishment" candidates. Throughout the election, Russia's online influence actors sought to amplify mistrust in the electoral process by denigrating mail-in ballots, highlighting alleged irregularities, and accusing the Democratic Party of voter fraud.  
    -   
    - The Kremlin-linked influence organization Project Lakhta and its Lakhta Internet Research (LIR) troll farm--commonly referred to by its former moniker Internet Research Agency (IRA)-amplified controversial domestic issues. LIR used social media personas, news websites, and US persons to deliver tailored content to subsets of the US population. LIR established short-lived troll farms that used unwitting third-country nationals in Ghana, Mexico, and Nigeria to propagate these US-focused narratives, probably in response to efforts by US companies and law enforcement to shut down UR-associated personas.  
    -   
    - Russian state media, trolls, and online proxies, including those directed by Russian intelligence, published disparaging content about President Biden, his family, and the Democratic Party, and heavily amplified related content circulating in US media, including stories centered on his son. These influence actors frequently sought out US contributors to increase their reach into US audiences. In addition to election-related content, these online influence actors also promoted conspiratorial narratives about the COVID-19 pandemic, made allegations of social media censorship, and highlighted US divisions surrounding protests about racial justice.  
    -   
    - Russian online influence actors generally promoted former President Trump and his commentary, including repeating his political messaging on the election results; the presidential campaign; debates; the impeachment inquiry; and, as the election neared, US domestic crises. Influence actors sometimes sought to discourage US left-leaning audiences from voting by suggesting that neither candidate was a preferable option. At the same time, Russian actors criticized former President Trump or his administration when they pursued foreign policies-such as the targeted killing of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in January 2020--at odds with Russia's preferences.  
    -   
    - LIR, which probably receives tasking and strategic direction from the Kremlin, pushed stories supporting former President Trump and denigrating President Biden after he became the presumptive nominee in April.`

    - `We assess that Russian leaders viewed President Biden's potential election as disadvantageous to Russian interests and that this drove their efforts to undermine his candidacy. We have high confidence in this assessment.  
    -   
    - Russian officials and state media frequently attacked President Biden for his leading role in the Obama administration's Ukraine policy and his support for the anti-Putin opposition in Russia, suggesting the Kremlin views him as part of a reflexively anti-Russia US foreign policy establishment. Putin probably also considers President Biden more apt to echo the idea of American "exceptionalism," which he and other Kremlin leaders have often publicly criticized as problematic and dangerous.  
    -   
    - Moscow's range of influence actors uniformly worked to denigrate President Biden after his entrance into the race. Throughout the primaries and general election campaign, Russian influence agents repeatedly spread unsubstantiated or misleading claims about President Biden and his family's alleged wrongdoing related to Ukraine. By contrast, during the Democratic primaries Russian online influence actors promoted candidates that Moscow viewed as outside what it perceives to be an anti-Russia political establishment.  
    -   
    - Even after the election, Russian online influence actors continued to promote narratives questioning the election results and disparaging President Biden and the Democratic Party. These efforts parallel plans Moscow had in place in 2016 to discredit a potential incoming Clinton administration, but which it scrapped after former President Trump's victory.`

- There was a total of 64 pre and post-election lawsuits in regards to Trump’s claims of voter integrity & fraud.
    
    - `Of the 64 cases brought by Trump and his supporters, twenty were dismissed before a hearing on the merits, fourteen were voluntarily dismissed by Trump and his supporters before a hearing on the merits, and 30 cases included a hearing on the merits. Only in one Pennsylvania case involving far too few votes to overturn the results did Trump and his supporters prevail.` [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aqorZ61AYFqZU-EDQBBzjqfvAoC5nKcB/view)
    
### SCOTUS
### Mike Kelly, et al. v. Pennsylvania, et al.
- On 3 December 2020, 28 Republican politicians, led by Rep. Mike Kelly, asked the US Supreme Court to block the certification of Pennsylvania's election results alleging that “no excuse” absentee voting law unlawfully expanded the scope of absentee voting. Plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order against certification while the courts ruled on the issue. [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/20-810.html)
- On 8 December 2020, The court turned down the case.
    
    - `First, Petitioners’ unjustifiable delay in filing suit not only supports the application of laches, but also weighs against issuing an injunction. Petitioners waited over a year after Act 77 passed—and then weeks after Election Day—to first bring their claims. Petitioners should not receive extraordinary relief after unduly delaying in a manner that created the very exigent circumstances that supposedly animate their rush to this Court.  
    -   
    - ...  
    -   
    - Second, the public interest in avoiding mass disenfranchisement of an entire state militates overwhelmingly against Petitioners’ request for relief. As Judge Sutton has explained, “[c]all it what you will—laches, the Purcell principle, or common sense—the idea is that courts will not disrupt imminent elections absent a powerful reason for doing so.”  
    -   
    - ...  
    -   
    - Finally, granting an injunction would sow chaos and confusion across the Nation while inflaming baseless concerns about electoral impropriety and ensnaring the Judiciary in partisan strife. This case reaches the Court against the backdrop of unfounded claims—which have been repeatedly rejected by state and federal courts— that wrongly impugn the integrity of the democratic process and aim to cast doubt on the legitimacy of its outcome. Given that context, the Court should not plunge itself into a firestorm by issuing the first ever judicial order decertifying the results of a presidential election. Instead, it should stay true to “the trust of a Nation that here, We the People rule.”  
    -   
    - ...  
    -   
    - Petitioner’s application for a writ of injunction should be denied.`

### Texas v. Pennsylvania, et al.
- On 7 December 2020, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan, and Wisconsin in the US Supreme Court seeking to overturn their election results. [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/22o155.html)
- On 11 December 2020,The Supreme Court rejected the case.
    
    - `The State of Texas’s motion for leave to file a bill of complaint is denied for lack of standing under Article III of the Constitution. Texas has not demonstrated a judicially cognizable interest in the manner in which another State  
    - conducts its elections. All other pending motions are dismissed as moot.  
    -   
    - Statement of Justice Alito, with whom Justice Thomas joins: In my view, we do not have discretion to deny the filing of a bill of complaint in a case that falls within our original jurisdiction. ... . I would therefore grant the motion to file the bill of complaint but would not grant other relief, and I express no view on any other issue.`

### Donald J. Trump, v. Cyrus R. Vance, Jr., et al.
- On 13 October 2020, The Trump campaign asked the US Supreme Court to overturn three decisions from the Pennsylvania Supreme Court over various technical rules regarding absentee and mail-in ballots. [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/20a63.html)
- On 22 February 2021, The court rejected the case declaring it moot.
    
    - `First, Applicant contends that he will be irreparably harmed even if the relevant documents are disclosed only to the “grand jury and prosecutors.” Appl. 33. But the primary authority Applicant cites for that proposition, Church of Scientology of Cal. v. United States, 506 U.S. 9 (1992), suggests the opposite. There, the Court held that a party’s appeal of an order requiring it to produce records to the government does not become moot even after the party has produced those records.  
    -   
    - ...  
    -   
    - Second, Applicant claims irreparable harm from the possibility that his records may be “disclosed publicly” outside the grand jury. Appl. 33. But as noted, Applicant must show a “likelihood”—not a mere hypothetical possibility—“that irreparable harm will result from the denial of” relief. ... There is no likelihood that his records will become public, given the “presumption of confidentiality [that] attaches to the record of Grand Jury proceedings.”  
    -   
    - ...  
    -   
    - Finally, Applicant contends that the purported harm is “particularly pressing” because he “challenges a subpoena to a third party.” Appl. 34. But the subpoena’s issuance to a third party (Mazars) is immaterial because everyone agrees that it “is functionally a subpoena issued to the President.” ... That is why, throughout these proceedings, Mazars has taken “no position on the legal issues raised” and indicated that it would follow any court order.`

    - `The application for a stay presented to Justice Breyer and referred to the Court is denied.` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/022221zor_2cp3.pdf)
    
### Arizona
### Aguilera v. Fontes,
- On 4 November 2020, a voter, Laurie Aguilera, filed a lawsuit accusing Maricopa County that Votes cast using Sharpies were unlawfully excluded from election results.
    
    - `Plaintiff Laurie Aguilera voted in person in Maricopa County on election day, November 3, 2020. She was provided with a sharpie by the poll workers with which to mark her ballot. Plaintiff completed her ballot with the provided sharpie. While completing it she noticed that the ink was bleeding through. Plaintiff has been voting in person for several election cycles. However, upon information and belief, she has never before been given a sharpie as a marking device by a poll worker. Plaintiff fed her ballot into the ballot box. The ballot box failed to properly register her vote causing a poll-worker to cancel her ballot in the presence of Plaintiff.  
    - Plaintiff requested a new ballot but, upon information and belief, upon consultation with the Maricopa County Reorder's Office, the poll workers refused to provide her with one. Upon information and belief, many other voters have experienced similar issues.  
    - Upon information and belief not all Arizona counties and polling places provided in-person voters with sharpies for marking devices.`  
    - [link](https://www.clerkofcourt.maricopa.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/1446/637401560936870000)
    
- On 7 November 2020, Plaintiff voluntarily dismissed after filing suit.
    
    - `Plaintiffs, pursuant to Ariz. R. Civ P. 41(a)(1)(A)(i), voluntarily dismiss without prejudice the claims in the above-entitled action against Defendants.` [link](https://www.clerkofcourt.maricopa.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/1536/637405062626170000)
    
- On 12 November 2020, a Second suit was brought by Aguilera, alleging her vote was not counted and asking for opportunity to cast a new ballot.
    
    - `Plaintiff Laurie Aguilera voted in person in Maricopa County on election day, November 3, 2020 alongside her husband Damian Aguilera. Neither Plaintiff Aguilera nor her husband are on the early voting list or received ballots by mail. Ex. B. [Aguilera family ballot status informationl. When election-day voters like Plaintiff Aguilera showed up to the polls, they were checked in by poll-workers on tablet-style devices and their names were then logged into the county's electronic pollbook. Plaintiff Aguilera and her husband were checked-in to the polls by a poll-worker. Plaintiff Aguilera completed her ballot according to the instructions provided by Defendants. Plaintiff Aguilera and her husband attempted to feed their ballots into the tabulator as instructed. Upon information and belief, when a ballot is successfully read and insetted into a tabulator, the tabulator displays a confirmation that the ballot has been accepted on a small digital readout.` [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20201116024331/https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/2020/11/CV2020-014562.pdf)
    
- On 29 November 2020, the State judge dismissed the case after an evidentiary hearing.
    
    - `Plaintiff Aguilera asserts that she was unable to successfully cast her ballot in person at the polls on 11/3/2020, Election Day. Aguilera testified that on Election Day, she and her husband Damian Aguilera went together to vote in person at the Sheraton Hotel at 26th Avenue and Dunlap in Phoenix. Aguilera's husband testified that he voted without incident just ahead of his wife. Aguilera testified that when she inserted her completed ballot into the tabulator machine, the tabulator screen did not ligtrt up or make any noise. Poll workers who came to assist Aguilera thought the tabulator looked as though it was ready to receive another ballot and told Aguilera she needed to vote again. When Aguilera began the process of doing so by scanning in her identification at the check-in kiosk, the kiosk indicated that she had already cast her ballot and gave her the option to cancel the ballot.` [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20201202180408/https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/2020/11/Final-Order-CV2020-014562-ME-11-30.pdf)
    
### Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. v. Hobbs. (Sharpie Lawsuit)
- On 7 November 2020, The Trump Campaign, Republican National Committee, and Arizona Republican Party alleged that Maricopa County elections officials violated state and federal law when overriding electronic tabulator errors for ballots rejected by an electronic tabulation device. [link](http://www.superiorcourt.maricopa.gov/docket/CivilCourtCases/caseInfo.asp?caseNumber=cv2020-014248)
- There is no evidence that using Sharpies leads to issues with scanning ballots and officials have said using Sharpies is preferred. Arizona's Secretary of State Katie Hobbs tweeted,
    
    - `IMPORTANT: If you voted a regular ballot in-person, your ballot will be counted, no matter what kind of pen you used (even a Sharpie)!` [link](https://twitter.com/SecretaryHobbs/status/1324074443740647425)
    
- The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, formed in 2018 by legislation Trump signed, has also labelled the conspiracy theory a false rumour.
    
    - `Election jurisdictions allow voters to mark ballots with varying types of writing instruments, based on state law and other considerations such as tabulation system requirements. Poll workers are required to provide approved writing devices to voters.  
    -   
    - Although felt-tip pens, like Sharpies, may bleed through ballots, some election officials have stated that ballot tabulation equipment in their jurisdictions can still read these ballots. Many jurisdictions even design their ballots with offset columns to prevent any potential bleed through from impacting the ability to easily scan both sides of ballots.  
    -   
    - If a ballot has issues that impact its ability to be scanned, it can be hand counted or duplicated, or adjudicated by election officials, who use defined procedures such as chain of custody to ensure protect ballot secrecy and integrity. Many states additionally have “voter intent” laws that allow for ballots to be counted even when issues such as bleed-throughs or stray marks are present, as long as the voter’s intent can still be determined.`  
    - [link](https://www.cisa.gov/rumorcontrol\#rumor18)
    
- On 10 November 2020, A Republican-aligned group abandoned the legal fight after Maricopa County officials challenged the factual basis for the lawsuit.
    
    - `This lawsuit is yet one more attempt by the President’s unsuccessful reelection campaign to alter the results of a properly administered general election—or, at the very least, to cast doubt, on the integrity of the election and the veracity of the results. But once again, Plaintiffs’ claims are unmoored from both law and fact, with allegations strung together by rank speculation and selective generalization. This Court should follow the lead of its sister jurisdictions across the country and dismiss this case.  
    -   
    - For the reasons stated above, Plaintiffs’ Complaint should be dismissed.`  
    - [link](https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TrumpvHobbs-MotiontoDismiss-As-Filed-1.pdf)
    
- On 13 November 2020, the Trump campaign lost the fight soon afterward.
    
    - `Since the close of yesterday’s hearing, the tabulation of votes statewide has rendered unnecessary a judicial ruling as to the presidential electors.` [link](https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NoticeofPartialMootness-1.pdf)

### Kelli Ward v. Constance Jackson et al., and Katie Hobbs.
- On 30 November 2020, an Arizona voter and state Republican Party Chair, Kelli Ward, filed a lawsuit in the Superior Court of Arizona, Maricopa County. Ward challenged the signature verification process, claiming election workers were unfit to verify signatures. Ward also challenged the ballot duplication process, whereby bipartisan county workers transferred votes to new ballots when ballot tabulators could not read them, claiming that observers were not allowed to view the entire process. [link](https://www.azcourts.gov/newsandinfo/High-Profile-Case-Update/CV-20-0343)
- On 4 December 2020, Arizona's Superior Court of Maricopa County
    
    - `A.R.S. § 16-672(A)(5) permits an election contest on the ground that, “by reason of erroneous count of votes” the candidate certified as the winner “did not in fact receive the highest number of votes.” Plaintiff has not proven that the Biden/Harris ticket did not receive the highest number of votes.` [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20201230073802/https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/2020/11/Order-2.pdf)
    
- On 8 December 2020, Arizona's Supreme Court unanimously rejected the appeal of the Superior Court case saying the facts Ward presented were incorrect and that she "fails to present any evidence of misconduct."
    
    - `Intervenor Maricopa County argues that the trial court could not entertain this challenge under A.R.S. § 16-672(A) which authorizes a contest of the “election of any person declared elected to state office.” Intervenors/Defendants/Amicus contend that the Court must decide this matter within the “safe harbor” deadline of 3 U.S.C. § 5.  
    -   
    - The Court concludes, unanimously, that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in denying the request to continue the hearing and permit additional inspection of the ballots. The November 9, 2020 hand count audit revealed no discrepancies in the tabulation of votes and the statistically negligible error presented in this case falls far short of warranting relief under A.R.S. § 16-672. Because the challenge fails to present any evidence of “misconduct,” “illegal votes” or that the Biden Electors “did not in fact receive the highest number of votes for office,” let alone establish any degree of fraud or a sufficient error rate that would undermine the certainty of the election results, the Court need not decide if the challenge was in fact authorized under A.R.S. § 16-672 or if the federal “safe harbor” deadline applies to this contest. Therefore,  
    -   
    - IT IS ORDERED affirming the trial court decision and confirming the election of the Biden Electors under A.R.S. § 16-676(B).`

### Bowyer v. Ducey.
- On 2 December 2020, Sidney Powell, who litigated on behalf of some Arizona voters and one candidate for Republican Arizona presidential elector, filed a lawsuit in federal court against the governor, secretary of state, and other Arizona election officials. They asked the court to decertify Arizona's election results, or order that Arizona certify Trump electors. [link](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/18707812/bowyer-v-ducey/)
- On 9 December 2020, The judge ruled that the plaintiffs lacked legal standing.
    
    - `Plaintiffs bring their Complaint seeking injunctive relief from this Court, specifically, to “set aside the results of the 2020 General Election,” because they claim the election process and results were “so riddled with fraud, illegality and statistical impossibility . . . that Arizona voters, courts and legislators cannot rely on or certify” its results. (Doc. 1 at 2). By any measure, the relief Plaintiffs seek is extraordinary. If granted, millions of Arizonans who exercised their individual right to vote in the 2020 General Election would be utterly disenfranchised. Such a request should then be accompanied by clear and conclusive facts to support the alleged “egregious range of conduct in Maricopa County and other Arizona counties . . . at the direction of Arizona state election officials.” (Id.) Yet the Complaint’s allegations are sorely wanting of relevant or reliable evidence, and Plaintiffs’ invocation of this Court’s limited jurisdiction is severely strained. Therefore, for the reasons stated herein, the Complaint shall be dismissed.` [link](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.azd.1255923/gov.uscourts.azd.1255923.84.0_2.pdf)
    
### Stevenson v. Ducey,
- On 4 December 2020, A group of voters alleged that Arizona election officials did not enforce Arizona residency requirements, permitted “double voting,” and used the Center for Tech and Civic Life to create illegal disparities in ballot and drop-box voting in demographically different areas of Arizona. Plaintiffs sought an injunction to prevent the certification of the election results and asked the governor to certify legislatively selected Presidential Electors.
    
    - `The Plaintiffs, by and through their attorneys of record, file this voter election contest to vacate the certification of the November 3, 2020 Presidential election result in Arizona pursuant to Arizona Statutes § 16-672 et. seq. The election officials’ absentee ballot error rate is legally unacceptable in light of the razor-thin vote margin.` [link](https://www.clerkofcourt.maricopa.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/1914/637426926829400000)
    
- On 7 November 2020, Plaintiff voluntarily dismissed after filing suit.
    
    - `Petitioners, pursuant to Rule 41 (a)(1)(A)(i) of the Arizona Rules of Civil Procedure, hereby give notice of their voluntary dismissal of the above-captioned action, without prejudice, and with no costs assigned to either party.  
    -

### Burk v. Ducey,
- On 7 November 2020, A voter alleged widespread voter fraud, including: failing to count valid ballots and fraudulently switching Trump votes to Biden ones; counting unlawful absentee and mail-in ballots; committing fraud with Dominion machines; and violating observation rights. The voter asked the court to decertify Arizona’s presidential election results or exclude unlawful absentee and mail-in ballots from the count.
    
    - `Plaintiff brings forth this election complaint to bring forth election fraud as well as violations of Arizona election laws, Electors Clauses, and the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, of the U.S. Constitution. These violations occurred during the 2020 General Election throughout the State of Arizona, as set forth in the affidavits of eyewitnesses and the voter data cited, the statistical anomalies and mathematical impossibilities detailed in the affidavits of expert witnesses.  
    -   
    - Plaintiff alleges a widespread scheme and artifice to defraud the election for the purpose of illegally and fraudulently manipulating the vote count to manufacture an election of Joe Biden as President of the United States,and also of various down ballot democrat candidates in the 2020 election cycle. This fraud was executed by the systemic adaptation of old-fashioned "ballot-stuffing," which included the transport of fraudulent ballots taken to the county tabulation center as well as by using software to manipulate the vote count in Maricopa County and using fraudulent and altered ballots in outlying counties to create an appearance ofa similar proportional result in the outlying counties such as Pinal.  
    -   
    - The widespread election fraud has now been amplified and rendered virtually invisible by computer software reated and run by domestic and foreign actors for this very purpose. This Complaint details an especially egregious nge of conduct in Maricopa County and other Arizona counties using employing Dominion Systems, though this onduct occurred throughout the State at the direction of Arizona state election officials.`

In re: Enforcement of Election Laws and Securing Ballots Cast or Received after 7:00pm on November 3, 2020. [link](https://healthyelections-case-tracker.stanford.edu/detail?id=345)
- On 4 November 2020, the Trump campaign and the Georgia Republican Party filed suit in the Chatham County Superior Court, alleging that the Chatham County Board of Elections had failed "to safely store absentee ballots" and might be illegally accepting "absentee ballots arriving after 7:00 p.m. on Election Day.”
- On 5 November 2020, The judge denied the request to toss out the 53 ballots that a GOP poll watcher said arrived after polls closed at 7 p.m. on November 3.
    
    - `Before the Court is a Petition to Command Enforcement of Election Laws which was filed by the Georgia Republican Party and Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. The matter was heard via Webex on November 5, 2020. Having read and considered said petition, all argument and evidence of record, including the evidence presented at the hearing, and the applicable law, the Court finds that there is no evidence that the ballots referenced in the petition were received after 7:00 p.m. on election day, thereby making those ballots invalid. Additionally, there is no evidence that the Chatham County Board of Elections or the Chatham County Board of Registrars has failed to comply with the law.  
    -   
    - WHEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the above petition is DISMISSED.`

- Republican elector Lin Wood, [whose attorney also represents the Trump campaign](https://lawandcrime.com/2020-election/trump-appointed-judge-rejects-lin-woods-creative-election-lawsuit-in-georgia/), sued to stop vote certification because. He argued that because the Georgia Secretary of State agreed to allow signature matching on ballots — a measure designed to prevent voter fraud — eight months before the election, his rights as an individual voter had been infringed upon. A state judge [dismissed the case](https://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/judge-dismisses-trump-campaign-lawsuit-seeking-to-halt-georgia-election-certification), [saying the arguments have "no basis in fact and law."](https://lawandcrime.com/2020-election/trump-appointed-judge-rejects-lin-woods-creative-election-lawsuit-in-georgia/)
  
  
- Wood filed another lawsuit in federal court and [lost that one as well](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/7334748/12-5-20-11th-Circuit-Opinion-Wood-v-Raffensperger.pdf), [losing again upon appeal](https://twitter.com/marceelias/status/1343603310293606401).
  
  
- Sidney Powell, [who was kicked off of Trump's legal team](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-lost-patience-with-conspiracy-theorist-attorney-powell-nyt-2020-11) after spreading numerous conspiracy theories about election fraud, filed a federal lawsuit in Georgia alleging widespread election fraud. A federal judge [quickly dismissed the case](https://www.businessinsider.com/sidney-powell-loses-2-kraken-lawsuits-in-one-day-in-georgia-michigan-2020-12), calling it "extraordinary" that the lawsuit sought to disqualify the votes of millions of voters.
  
  
- Nearly two months after he lost the election, [Trump sued Georgia Governor Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brian Raffensperger](https://lawandcrime.com/2020-election/trumps-new-lawsuit-seeking-to-decertify-georgia-election-provides-insight-into-absurd-claims-made-in-his-call-with-secretary-of-state/) seeking to "de-certify" the election, arguing that it wasn't carried out in accordance with Georgia law. Trump withdrew the case on January 7, according to court records reviewed by Insider.
### Michigan
- In a federal lawsuit, the Trump campaign alleged a number of irregularities — [such as that GOP election observers were told to stand six feet away from ballot counters because of the coronavirus](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-michigan-election-lawsuit-poll-watchers-social-distancing-complaints-2020-11) — meant that Michigan should not certify its votes. The Trump campaign [withdrew the lawsuit](https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.miwd.99598/gov.uscourts.miwd.99598.33.0.pdf), with [Rudy Giuliani falsely declaring it achieved the result the campaign wanted](https://twitter.com/WardDPatrick/status/1329444160701685762).
- A judge on the Michigan Court of Claims denied the Trump campaign's request to stop counting ballots in the state. [Judge Cynthia Stephens said](https://www.michigan.gov/documents/ag/20201106_Opin_and_Ord_707156_7.pdf) litigating the issue didn't make sense given that ballots in Michigan had more or less been fully counted.
- A poll challenger named Sarah Stoddard and a group called the Election Integrity Fund [filed a lawsuit](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/detroit-city/2020/11/05/election-challenger-suit-halt-detroit-absentee-vote-count/6181615002/) seeking to stop the certification of election results in Detroit, claiming that absentee ballots were improperly reviewed. Judge Timothy Kenny [denied](https://www.michigan.gov/documents/ag/Stoddard_et_al_v_City_Election_Commission_et_al_-_11-06-2020_707182_7.pdf) the motion on the grounds that there was no proof that election oversight protocol hadn't been followed. Kenny issued another ruling later denying other motions, including [a request for an additional audit of the election](https://beta.documentcloud.org/documents/20407012-michigan-election-lawsuit-kenney-costantino-et-al-v-wayne-boc-et-al-opinion-order).
- A [Republican-aligned law firm](https://greatlakesjc.org/cases/costantino_v_detroit/) called the Great Lakes Justice Center [filed a lawsuit](https://greatlakesjc.org/wp-content/uploads/Complaint-Costantino-FINAL-With-Exhibits.pdf?x44644) in Wayne County's Circuit Court against Detroit and Wayne County alleging "massive fraud in the election vote-counting procedures" and calling for an entirely new election. A judge [denied](https://www.wsj.com/articles/michigan-judge-denies-conservative-group-s-request-to-delay-detroit-election-certification-11605295879) the case.
    
    - `Perhaps if Plaintiffs’ election challenger affiants had attended the October 29, 2020 walk-through of the TCF Center ballot counting location, questions and concerns could have been answered in advance of Election Day. Regrettably, they did not and, therefore, Plaintiffs’ affiants did not have a full understanding of the TCF absent ballot tabulation process. No formal challenges were filed. However, sinister, fraudulent motives were ascribed to the process and the City of Detroit. Plaintiffs’ interpretation of events is incorrect and not credible.` [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20210522064008/https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/2020/11/Scanned-from-a-Xerox-Multifunction-Printer.pdf)
    
- Trump ally Sidney Powell also has a federal lawsuit pending in Michigan. It asks the judge to "de-certify" the state's electoral votes, which have already gone to Biden. The lawsuit [has numerous typos](https://www.businessinsider.com/sidney-powell-hypes-election-lawsuit-despite-trump-disowning-2020-11) and [cites voting statistics from a county that does not exist](https://www.businessinsider.com/sidney-powell-election-lawsuit-witness-vote-problems-edison-county-2020-12). A judge [ruled against her](https://www.businessinsider.com/sidney-powell-loses-2-kraken-lawsuits-in-one-day-in-georgia-michigan-2020-12) and issued a scathing 35-page opinion tearing it down on multiple fronts. She has [appealed it all the way to the Supreme Court](https://lawandcrime.com/2020-election/kraken-concerned-about-elementh-amendment-lands-on-scotus-docket-asks-court-do-what-the-ghosts-on-other-side-of-potomac-would-have-wanted/), which [has not yet decided](https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/20-815.html) whether to take the case.
### Nevada
- The Trump campaign filed a lawsuit requesting that ballots stop being counted in the state over concerns about signature-matching technology and election observers' claims that they weren't being allowed to watch ballots being processed closely enough. The Nevada Supreme Court [denied the request](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/trump-files-emergency-nevada-appeal-over-clark-county-ballots).
- The Trump campaign and the RNC filed a lawsuit in state court asking to stop ballot counting in Clark County — a heavily Democratic area — until GOP officials could observe the process. A district judge rejected the request on the grounds that the plaintiffs did not have evidence to back up their allegations. Republicans appealed the case to the Nevada Supreme Court, which said on November 5 that the campaign and Republican officials had [reached a settlement that allowed expanded ballot observation](https://news3lv.com/news/local/trump-campaign-reaches-settlement-in-nevada-lawsuit-to-expand-ballot-observation). They later [withdrew the case](https://apnews.com/article/trump-gop-drop-nevada-court-appeal-393931ac5e189e62d9bd89f2128ea675).
- A group of Republicans [[lawsuitdroppedovermore3000absen]], including those sent by members of the military.
- The Trump campaign [filed a different lawsuit](https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/trump-campaign-files-lawsuit-asking-judge-to-overturn-or-annul-nevadas-presidential-election-results) in Carson City District Court alleging multiple irregularities that the campaign claimed, without providing specific evidence, would be enough to overturn the election results in Nevada and flip the state to Trump. [It failed](https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/why-trumps-lawsuit-seeking-to-overturn-nevadas-presidential-race-sputtered-in-court).
### New Mexico

### Pennsylvania
  

> `Free, fair elec­tions are the lifeblood of our demo­cracy. Charges of unfair­ness are seri­ous. But call­ing an elec­tion unfair does not make it so. Charges require specific alleg­a­tions and then proof. We have neither here.` [link](https://www2.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/203371np.pdf)
- The Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee filed a lawsuit asking a state appeals court to reject the Pennsylvania secretary of state's announcement that registered voters had until November 12 to provide proof of identity for mail-in ballots. Republicans believe the deadline should be November 9. This is the one case [that Trump won](https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/11/12/trump-campaign-election-2020-presidential-pennsylvania-lawsuit-ballots-late-identification/stories/202011120132), before the state Supreme Court [overturned the lower court decision](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/17/philadelphia-donald-trump-us-elections-2020-joe-biden).
- In [a wide-ranging federal lawsuit](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-pennsylvania-election-lawsuit-allege-voter-fraud-2-counties-2020-11), the Trump campaign sued over alleged irregularities in the way ballots were counted throughout the state. They've [argued that 14,000 votes should be thrown out](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-campaign-lawsuit-pennsylvania-votes-biden-enough-win-2020-11). The campaign submitted [a revised version of the lawsuit](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-campaign-drops-part-of-pa-lawsuit-regarding-election-observers-2020-11) days later that retracted many of its original allegations. A judge [threw out the case](https://www.businessinsider.com/federal-judge-brann-rejects-trump-campaign-lawsuit-pennsylvania-2020-11), saying Trump's lawyers presented the court "with [strained legal arguments](https://www.businessinsider.com/pennsylvania-defense-lawyers-shredded-rudy-giuliani-trump-election-lawsuit-2020-11) without merit and speculative accusations, unpaid in the operative complaint and unsupported by evidence." An appeal of the case [also failed](https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Trump.pdf).
    
    - `This claim, like Franken­stein’s Monster, has been haphaz­ardly stitched together` ... `This Court has been presen­ted with strained legal argu­ments without merit and spec­u­lat­ive accus­a­tions, unpled in the oper­at­ive complaint and unsupported by evid­ence. In the United States of Amer­ica, this cannot justify the disen­fran­chise­ment of a single voter, let alone all the voters of its sixth most popu­lated state.

- [Another federal lawsuit](https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/2020/10/show_temp.pl-4.pdf) brought by Republicans sought to delay the deadline for ballot requests. The judge [rejected it](https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/2020/10/Third-Circuit-Opinion.pdf).
- A third federal lawsuit [sought to stop](https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/2020/11/Eastern-District-Complaint.pdf) the Montgomery County Board of Elections from allowing voters to "cure" their ballots — a process that allows people to fix clerical errors on their ballots to make sure their votes count. Republicans [abandoned the lawsuit and withdrew from the case](https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/2020/11/ORDER-1.pdf).
- The campaign sued in yet another federal case [to stop Philadelphia County from counting votes](https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/2020/11/FullText.pdf) without Republicans present. The judge [dismissed the case](https://whyy.org/articles/trump-asks-federal-court-to-stop-vote-counting-in-phiadelphia/) after Trump's lawyers said Republican election watchers were, in fact, present.
- In another Montgomery County case, [this one filed in a local court](https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/2020/11/Donald-J.-Trump-for-President-Inc.-v.-Montgomery-County-Board-of-Elections.pdf), Trump's lawyers sought to stop the county from counting mail-in ballots. [The lawyers withdrew from the case](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/13/trump-law-firm-withdraws-pennsylvania-election-case).
- A lawsuit in Bucks County filed by Republican congressional candidate Kathy Barnette on Election Day made a technical challenge on the county's method of organizing ballots before counting them. She [withdrew the case](https://www.buckscountycouriertimes.com/story/news/2020/11/05/barnette-withdraws-mail-ballot-lawsuit-montgomery-county-election/6176910002/) two days later and lost the election.
- The Trump campaign [appealed that Bucks County case](https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/2020/11/TS-Petition-for-Review-of-Decision-by-Bucks-County-Board-of-Elections-11.9.2020-1.pdf) soon afterward, but a judge [rejected it](http://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2020/images/11/19/scan.document_11192020_041015.pdf) and [pointed out in his ruling](https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/19/politics/arizona-pennsylvania-georgia-lawsuits-trump-biden/index.html) that fraud wasn't an issue.
- In a state court, Republicans [challenged an instruction from the Secretary of State's office regarding provisional ballots](https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/2020/11/Preview_08501C84-5760-47CE-A63C-47106B07AB6D-1.pdf). A state appellate court judge [dismissed](https://twitter.com/johnkruzel/status/1324811512003891202) the request but [ordered](https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/2020/11/FILE-8407.pdf) the secretary of state to [segregate](https://www.businessinsider.com/why-pennsylvania-texas-minnesota-segregating-ballots-in-case-thrown-out-2020-11) provisional ballots in case their validity becomes contested.
- Local Republicans sought to stop Northampton County from revealing the identities of people whose ballots were canceled and [lost the case](https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/2020/11/ORDER-11-3-20.pdf).
- A group of Pennsylvania Republicans [lost](https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/28/politics/pennsylvania-state-supreme-court-election-case/index.html) at the state Supreme Court with a lawsuit trying to invalidate absentee voting after the voting period already ended, and trying to block the certification of election results.
- Another group of Republicans filed [a similar lawsuit](https://www.democracydocket.com/cases/pennsylvania-decertification-challenge/) and lost.
- The Trump campaign filed a [motion to intervene in a Supreme Court case](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-trump-may-challenge-2020-election-supreme-court-2020-11) brought by Republicans that centers on the deadline by which Pennsylvania officials are allowed to receive ballots. Pennsylvania's Supreme Court ruled that officials could receive ballots until November 6 as long as they are postmarked by Election Day. Republicans appealed the decision to the high court, which was deadlocked at 4-4 because Justice Amy Coney Barrett did not participate, leaving the lower court's ruling in place. The Supreme Court signaled it could hear the case again but has not granted the request to intervene.
### Wisconsin
- The Wisconsin Supreme Court [rejected a case](https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-donald-trump-wisconsin-lawsuits-2917742813e06908608848410ff41b0c) from the Trump campaign seeking to overturn election results.
- Trump personally filed a similar lawsuit in a federal court in Wisconsin. A Trump-appointed federal judge said he had standing to bring the case — a rare departure from other judges — [and then ruled against him](https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2020/12/12/trump-wisconsin-lawsuit-dismissed-federal-judge/3894689001/). [An appeal failed as well](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/24/trump-loses-wisconsin-georgia-450433), with the author of the appellate opinion also a Trump appointee.
- Wisconsin Voters Alliance, a right-wing group, [sued the state elections commission](https://www.wpr.org/lawsuit-asks-wisconsin-supreme-court-throw-out-results-presidential-election) and asked the state Supreme Court to throw out votes and have the Republican-controlled state legislature select the electoral college winner themselves. [The state Supreme Court rejected it, saying it had little basis in fact](https://www.channel3000.com/state-supreme-court-rejects-lawsuit-from-conservative-group-attempting-to-prevent-certification-of-election-results/).
    
    - `At stake, in some meas­ure, is faith in our system of free and fair elec­tions, a feature cent­ral to the endur­ing strength of our consti­tu­tional repub­lic. It can be easy to blithely move on to the next case with a peti­tion so obvi­ously lack­ing, but this is sober­ing. The relief being sought by the peti­tion­ers is the most dramatic invoc­a­tion of judi­cial power I have ever seen. Judi­cial acqui­es­cence to such entreat­ies built on so flimsy a found­a­tion would do indelible damage to every future elec­tion.` [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20210522064207/https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/2020/11/2020AP1930-OAfinal-12-4-20.pdf)
    
- Wisconsin Voter Alliance also sued a number of defendants in Washington, DC, including Vice President Mike Pence, both houses of Congress, and the Electoral College, trying to block the certification of Wisconsin's votes as well as those of other states. [A federal judge threw out the case](https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.225330/gov.uscourts.dcd.225330.10.0_1.pdf), blasted it as an attempted "undermining of a democratic election" full of falsehoods, and said he would refer the attorneys for sanctions.
- [Another lawsuit](https://www.wpr.org/new-lawsuit-asks-state-supreme-court-toss-nov-3-election-results) backed by the Republican-aligned Amos Center for Justice and Liberty argued that the use of ballot drop-boxes was illegal. It also asked that the state Supreme Court should throw out every vote cast and have the GOP legislature select the state's electoral votes. A judge [ruled it moot](https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/2020/11/2020AP1958-OA-12-3-20.pdf).
- A lawsuit from Sidney Powell and Lin Wood, another Trump ally, makes numerous conspiratorial claims about the election. A federal judge [criticized it for containing errors and typos, and one person listed as plaintiff said they never signed up to be a part of the lawsuit](https://lawandcrime.com/2020-election/wisconsin-federal-judge-picks-apart-sidney-powell-and-lin-woods-lawsuit-in-brutal-order/), later [dismissing the case](https://www.businessinsider.com/sidney-powell-lawsuits-dismissed-michigan-georgia-arizona-wisconsin-2020-12).
- Trump and Pence personally sued Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris in a state court [seeking to overturn votes](https://lawandcrime.com/2020-election/outgoing-trump-white-house-sues-incoming-biden-white-house-to-disenfranchise-wisconsins-most-diverse-counties/) in two Wisconsin counties with large Black populations, both of which sided with Democrats. A judge [threw out the case](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-loses-wisconsin-election-lawsuit-challenging-mail-votes-2020-12). When Trump appealed the case, another judge rejected it and [said it "smacks of racism."](https://www.businessinsider.com/wisconsin-trump-election-fraud-lawsuit-smacks-of-racism-judge-says-2020-12) [An appeal to the Supreme Court also failed](https://www.wicourts.gov/sc/opinion/DisplayDocument.pdf?content=pdf&seqNo=315395).

- On 6 January 2021 @ 13:05PM EST, Vice President Pence released a letter about the Electoral College certification,
    
    - `Given the controversy surrounding this year's election, some approach this year's quadrennial tradition with great expectation, and others with dismissive disdain. Some believe that as Vice President, I should be able to accept or reject electoral votes unilaterally. Others believe that electoral votes should never be challenged in a Joint Session of Congress. After a careful study of our Constitution, our laws, and our history, I believe neither view is correct.  
    -   
    - ...  
    -   
    - Four years ago, surrounded by my family, I took an oath to support and defend the Constitution, which ended with the words, “ So help me God. ” Today I want to assure the American people that I will keep the oath I made to them and I will keep the oath I made to Almighty God. When the Joint Session of Congress convenes today, I will do my duty to see to it that we open the certificates of the Electors of the several states, we hear objections raised by Senators and Representatives, and we count the votes of the Electoral College for President and Vice President in a manner consistent with our Constitution, laws, and history. So Help Me God.`

## Post-Presidency Controversy’s
### 2019-24 Business Fraud Civil Suit
- [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_civil_investigation_of_The_Trump_Organization)
- [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iX0mULW0XZI&t)
- New York v. Trump, et al.
- In 2019, New York State Attorney General Letitia James had begun investigating the Trump Organization for potential financial fraud in a civil capacity.
- On 21 September 2022, New York attorney general Letitia James, filed a lawsuit accusing Donald Trump, Donald Trump Jr, Eric Trump, Ivanka Trump, and former Trump Organisation CFO Allen Weisselberg for overvaluing assets by billions of dollars.
    
    - `Mr. Trump and others affiliated with the Trump Organization who are named as Defendants employed a number of deceptive strategies as part of the overall scheme to fraudulently and falsely inflate Mr. Trump’s assets in order to comply with Mr. Trump’s instruction to increase his net worth. A chart showing many of the deceptive strategies employed by Mr. Trump and other Defendants by asset and year is attached as Exhibit 1, and includes the following, to list just a few:  
    -   
    - a. Relying on objectively false numbers to calculate property values. For example, Mr. Trump’s own triplex apartment in Trump Tower was valued as being 30,000 square feet when it was 10,996 square feet. As a result, in 2015 the apartment was valued at $327 million in total, or $29,738 per square foot. That price was absurd given the fact that at that point only one apartment in New York City had ever sold for even $100 million, at a price per square foot of less than $10,000. And that sale was in a newly built, ultra-tall tower. In 30 year-old Trump Tower, the record sale as of 2015 was a mere $16.5 million at a price of less than $4,500 per square foot.  
    -   
    - b. Ignoring legal restrictions on development rights and marketability that would materially decrease property values. For example:  
    -   
    - i. In the 2012 Statement, rent stabilized apartments at Trump Park Avenue were valued as if they were unrestricted, leading to a nearly $50 million valuation for those units—but an appraisal accounting for those units’ stabilized status valued them collectively at just $750,000;  
    -   
    - ii. The Mar-a-Lago club was valued as high as $739 million based on the false premise that it was unrestricted property and could be developed and sold for residential use, even though Mr. Trump himself signed deeds donating his residential development rights and sharply restricting changes to the property – in reality, the club generated annual revenues of less than $25 million and should have been valued at closer to $75 million; and  
    -   
    - iii. For his golf course in Aberdeen, Scotland, the valuation assumed 2,500 homes could be developed when the Trump Organization had obtained zoning approval to develop less than 1,500 cottages and apartments, many of which were expressly identified as being only for short-term rental. The $267 million value attributed to those 2,500 homes accounted for more than 80% of the total $327 million valuation for the Aberdeen property on the 2014 Statement.  
    -   
    - c. Failing to use basic rules of valuation to ensure reliable and accurate results—such as discounting revenue or cash flow that might be obtained from a speculative development far into the future to its present value. For example, a series of high-value properties estimated the profits from developing and selling homes without accounting for the years it would take to plan, build, and sell the homes and instead operated under the impossible and thus false premise that the homes could be planned, built, and sold instantaneously.  
    -   
    - d. Using an inappropriate valuation method for a given category of assets. For example, for the period 2013 to 2020, Mr. Trump’s golf course in Jupiter, Florida was valued using a fixed-asset approach even though that was not an acceptable method for valuing an operating golf course. And the bulk of the value in that fixed-asset approach was based on the use of an inflated purchase price from the purported assumption of “refundable” membership liabilities. Mr. Trump claimed to have paid $46 million for the club, consisting of $5 million in cash he actually paid and $41 million in assumed membership liabilities. In the Statement Mr. Trump did not disclose the inclusion of those inflated liabilities in the price of the club and in fact took the opposite position, stating that his potential liability for those membership deposits was zero.  
    -   
    - e. Increasing the value of golf clubs to incorporate a “brand premium” despite expressly advising in the Statements that brand value was not included in the figures and despite GAAP rules prohibiting inclusion of internally-generated intangible brand premiums. For example, in the 2013 Statement, the value of Mr. Trump’s golf course in Jupiter, Florida was further inflated by fraudulently adding 30% for the Trump “brand.” Combining the inflation from using the fixed-asset approach with the 30% brand premium, Mr. Trump claimed that a club he purchased for $5 million in 2012 was worth more than $62 million in 2013. The 2013 Statement included the same fraudulent 30% brand premium for six other golf clubs.  
    -   
    - f. Using inflated net operating income (“NOI”) figures and arbitrarily low capitalization rates to calculate valuations using the income capitalization method, where value is derived by dividing NOI by a capitalization rate. For example, in some instances the NOI for Trump Tower relied on favorable numbers by mixing time periods, using future income that exceeded the Trump Organization’s internal budget projections while also using expense figures that were lower than past expenses in audited financials. Capitalization rates were derived by cherry-picking an unsupported figure from, or averaging the lowest two or three capitalization rates listed in, generic marketing reports and ignoring rates in those same reports for buildings that were closer and more comparable to Trump Tower.

    - g. Claiming as Mr. Trump’s own “cash” monies belonging not to Mr. Trump but to partnerships in which Mr. Trump had only a limited partnership interest with no control over making disbursements. For example, one-third of the amount under “cash and cash equivalents” listed in the 2018 Statement belonged to Vornado Partnerships, not Mr. Trump. Those are partnerships in which he owns a minority 30% stake with no right to control distributions. Mr. Trump did the same thing in counting funds held in escrow. For example, one-half of the amount under “escrow” in the 2014 Statement belonged to the Vornado Partnership.

For example, at Mr. Trump’s golf course in Westchester, the valuation for 2011 assumed new members would pay an initiation fee of nearly $200,000 for each of the 67 unsold memberships, even though many new members in that year paid no initiation fee at all. In some instances, Mr. Trump specifically directed club employees to reduce or eliminate the initiation fees to boost membership numbers.`

- On 8 June 2023, Trump was indited on 37 charges including Wilful Retention of National Defence Information, Conspiracy to Obstruct Justice, Withholding a Document or Record, Corruptly Concealing a Document or Record, Concealing a Document in a Federal Investigation, Scheme to Conceal and False Statements and Representations. An aide to Trump, Walt Nauta was also indited for the same charges barring Wilful Retention of National Defence Information.
    
    - `The classified documents TRUMP stored in his boxes included information regarding defense and weapons capabilities of both the United States and foreign countries; United States nuclear programs; potential vulnerabilities of the United States and its allies to military attack; and plans for possible retaliation in response to as-foreign attack. The unauthorized disclosure of these classified documents could put at risk the national security of the United States, foreign relations, the safety of the United States military, and human sources and the continued viability of sensitive intelligence collection methods.  
    -   
    - At 12:00 p.m. on January 20, 2021, TRUMP ceased to be president. As he departed the White House, TRUMP caused scores of boxes, many of which contained classified documents, to be transported to The Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida, where he maintained his residence. TRUMP was not authorized to possess or retain those classified documents.`

    - `Two lawyers working for former President Donald Trump have quit his legal team just a day after he was indicted on federal charges in connection to his handling of classified information.  
    -   
    - “For purposes of fighting the Greatest Witch Hunt of all time, now moving to the Florida Courts, I will be represented by Todd Blanche, Esq., and a firm to be named later,” Mr Trump wrote on Truth Social on Friday.  
    -   
    - “I want to thank Jim Trusty and John Rowley for their work, but they were up against a very dishonest, corrupt, evil, and ‘sick’ group of people, the likes of which has not been seen before. We will be announcing additional lawyers in the coming days,” he added.  
    -   
    - Mr Rowley and Mr Trusty issued a joint statement in which they said that they had “tendered our resignations as counsel to President Trump, and we will no longer represent him on either the indicted case or the January 6 investigation”.`

    - `Remarkably, the report regarding the Mar-a-Lago search, conducted on December 15-16, 2023, uncovered four more responsive records. See id., Ex. D at 1-15 (four responsive records found at Mar-a-Lago on December 15-16, 2022). The certification misleadingly refers to these documents as "low-level ministerial documents" without any explicit mention whether they had classification markings, indicating only that one document includes "an explanation that it was no longer deemed `classified' if not connected to the attachment, and this document had no attachment." Id. ¶ 49. To be clear, the four documents were responsive to the May 2022 subpoena: "On or about December 15, 2022," the former president's counsel informed the government that "a box containing four documents or partial documents, totaling six pages, with classification markings were found in a closet" of the Office's designated space at Mar-a-Lago and "[t]hose documents contained markings at the Secret level."  
    -   
    - The Office provided the entire box in which the four responsive records were located to the FBI on approximately January 5, 2023, in compliance with another subpoena. Id.11 That was still not the end of the production of responsive records. In complying with the subpoena to produce that box, the Office also provided the FBI with two additional documents responsive to the May 2022 subpoena: "one empty folder and another mostly empty folder marked `Classified Evening Summary" that were found in the former president's bedroom at Mar-a-Lago.`

    - Co-Conspirator 1, (Rudy Gulliani), an attorney who was willing to spread knowingly false claims and pursue strategies that the Defendant's 2020 re-election campaign attorneys would not.
    - Co-Conspirator 2, (John Eastman), an attorney who devised and attempted to implement a strategy to leverage the Vice President's ceremonial role overseeing the certification proceeding to obstruct the certification of the presidential election.
    - Co-Conspirator 3, (Sidney Powell), an attorney whose unfounded claims of election fraud the Defendant privately acknowledged to others sounded "crazy." Nonetheless, the Defendant embraced and publicly amplified Co-Conspirator 3's disinformation.
    - Co-Conspirator 4, (Jeffrey Clark), a Justice Department official who worked on civil matters and who, with the Defendant, attempted to use the Justice Department to open sham election crime investigations and influence state legislatures with knowingly false claims of election fraud.
    - Co-Conspirator 5, (Kenneth Chesebro), an attorney who assisted in devising and attempting to implement a plan to submit fraudulent slates of presidential electors to obstruct the certification proceeding,
    - Co-Conspirator 6, (Boris Epshteyn), a political consultant who helped implement a plan to submit fraudulent slates of presidential electors to obstruct the certification proceeding.

- On 1 July 2024, SCOTUS held that President’s are entitled to `Presumptive Immunity`
- Syllabus
    
    - `When the President exercises such authority, Congress cannot act on, and courts cannot examine, the President’s actions. It follows that an Act of Congress—either a specific one targeted at the President or a generally applicable one—may not criminalize the President’s actions within his exclusive constitutional power. Neither may the courts adjudicate a criminal prosecution that examines such Presidential actions.` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024), Syllabus
    
    - `The reasons that justify the President’s absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for acts within the scope of his exclusive constitutional authority do not extend to conduct in areas where his authority is shared with Congress.` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024), Syllabus
    
    - `the Court concludes that the separation of powers principles explicated in the Court’s precedent necessitate at least a presumptive immunity from criminal prosecution for a President’s acts within the outer perimeter of his official responsibility. Such an immunity is required to safeguard the independence and effective functioning of the Executive Branch, and to enable the President to carry out his constitutional duties without undue caution. At a minimum, the President must be immune from prosecution for an official act unless the Government can show that applying a criminal prohibition to that act would pose no “dangers of intrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch.” Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 754. Pp. 12–15.` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024), Syllabus
    
    - `As for a President’s unofficial acts, there is no immunity. Although Presidential immunity is required for official actions to ensure that the President’s decisionmaking is not distorted by the threat of future litigation stemming from those actions, that concern does not support immunity for unofficial conduct. Clinton, 520 U. S., at 694, and n. 19. The separation of powers does not bar a prosecution predicated on the President’s unofficial acts. P. 15.` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024), Syllabus
    
    - `The immunity the Court has recognized therefore extends to the “outer perimeter” of the President’s official responsibilities, covering actions so long as they are “not manifestly or palpably beyond [his] authority.” Blassingame v. Trump, 87 F. 4th 1, 13 (CADC).` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024), Syllabus
    
    - `In dividing official from unofficial conduct, courts may not inquire into the President’s motives. Such a “highly intrusive” inquiry would risk exposing even the most obvious instances of official conduct to judicial examination on the mere allegation of improper purpose. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 756.` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024), Syllabus
    
    - `Because the President cannot be prosecuted for conduct within his exclusive constitutional authority, Trump is absolutely immune from prosecution for the alleged conduct involving his discussions with Justice Department officials.` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024), Syllabus
    
    - `Whenever the President and Vice President discuss their official responsibilities, they engage in official conduct. Presiding over the January 6 certification proceeding at which Members of Congress count the electoral votes is a constitutional and statutory duty of the Vice President. Art. II, §1, cl. 3; Amdt. 12; 3 U. S. C. §15. The indictment’s allegations that Trump attempted to pressure the Vice President to take particular acts in connection with his role at the certification proceeding thus involve official conduct, and Trump is at least presumptively immune from prosecution for such conduct.` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024), Syllabus
    
    - `The question then becomes whether that presumption of immunity is rebutted under the circumstances. It is the Government’s burden to rebut the presumption of immunity. The Court therefore remands to the District Court to assess in the first instance whether a prosecution involving Trump’s alleged attempts to influence the Vice President’s oversight of the certification proceeding would pose any dangers of intrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch. Pp. 21–24.` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024), Syllabus
    
    - `Determining whose characterization may be correct, and with respect to which conduct, requires a fact-specific analysis of the indictment’s extensive and interrelated allegations. The Court accordingly remands to the District Court to determine in the first instance whether Trump’s conduct in this area qualifies as official or unofficial. Pp. 24–28.` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024), Syllabus
    
    - `Presidents cannot be indicted based on conduct for which they are immune from prosecution. On remand, the District Court must carefully analyze the indictment’s remaining allegations to determine whether they too involve conduct for which a President must be immune from prosecution. And the parties and the District Court must ensure that sufficient allegations support the indictment’s charges without such conduct. Testimony or private records of the President or his advisers probing such conduct may not be admitted as evidence at trial. Pp. 30–32.` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024), Syllabus
    
    - `The Federalist Papers on which Trump relies concerned the checks available against a sitting President; they did not endorse or even consider whether the Impeachment Judgment Clause immunizes a former President from prosecution. Transforming the political process of impeachment into a necessary step in the enforcement of criminal law finds little support in the text of the Constitution or the structure of the Nation’s Government. Pp. 32–34.` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024), Syllabus
    
    - `This case poses a question of lasting significance: When may a former President be prosecuted for official acts taken during his Presidency? In answering that question, unlike the political branches and the public at large, the Court cannot afford to fixate exclusively, or even primarily, on present exigencies. Enduring separation of powers principles guide our decision in this case. The President enjoys no immunity for his unofficial acts, and not everything the President does is official. The President is not above the law. But under our system of separated powers, the President may not be prosecuted for exercising his core constitutional powers, and he is entitled to at least presumptive immunity from prosecution for his official acts. That immunity applies equally to all occupants of the Oval Office.` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024), Syllabus
    
- Justice Roberts Opinion of the Court
    
    - `We granted certiorari to consider the following question: “Whether and if so to what extent does a former President enjoy presidential immunity from criminal prosecution for conduct alleged to involve official acts during his tenure in office.”` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024)
    
    - `This case is the first criminal prosecution in our Nation’s history of a former President for actions taken during his Presidency. We are called upon to consider whether and under what circumstances such a prosecution may proceed. Doing so requires careful assessment of the scope of Presidential power under the Constitution. We undertake that responsibility conscious that we must not confuse “the issue of a power’s validity with the cause it is invoked to promote,” but must instead focus on the “enduring consequences upon the balanced power structure of our Republic.”` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024)
    
    - `If the President claims authority to act but in fact exercises mere “individual will” and “authority without law,” the courts may say so. Youngstown, 343 U. S., at 655 (Jackson, J., concurring). In Youngstown, for instance, we held that President Truman exceeded his constitutional authority when he seized most of the Nation’s steel mills. See id., at 582–589 (majority opinion). But once it is determined that the President acted within the scope of his exclusive authority, his discretion in exercising such authority cannot be subject to further judicial examination.` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024)
    
    - `At a minimum, the President must therefore be immune from prosecution for an official act unless the Government can show that applying a criminal prohibition to that act would pose no “dangers of intrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch.” Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 754.` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024)
    
    - `And some Presidential conduct—for example, speaking to and on behalf of the American people, see Trump v. Hawaii, 585 U. S. 667, 701 (2018)—certainly can qualify as official even when not obviously connected to a particular constitutional or statutory provision. For those reasons, the immunity we have recognized extends to the “outer perimeter” of the President’s official responsibilities, covering actions so long as they are “not manifestly or palpably beyond [his] authority.”` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024)
    
    - `In dividing official from unofficial conduct, courts may not inquire into the President’s motives. Such an inquiry would risk exposing even the most obvious instances of official conduct to judicial examination on the mere allegation of improper purpose, thereby intruding on the Article II interests that immunity seeks to protect.` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024)

The necessary analysis is instead fact specific, requiring assessment of numerous alleged interactions with a wide variety of state officials and private persons. And the parties’ brief comments at oral argument indicate that they starkly disagree on the characterization of these allegations. The concerns we noted at the outset—the expedition of this case, the lack of factual analysis by the lower courts, and the absence of pertinent briefing by the parties—thus become more prominent.

He is even expected to comment on those matters of public concern that may not directly implicate the activities of the Federal Government—for instance, to comfort the Nation in the wake of an emergency or tragedy. For these reasons, most of a President’s public communications are likely to fall comfortably within the outer perimeter of his official responsibilities.` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v.

    - `The implication of Trump’s theory is that a President who evades impeachment for one reason or another during his term in office can never be held accountable for his criminal acts in the ordinary course of law. So if a President manages to conceal certain crimes throughout his Presidency, or if Congress is unable to muster the political will to impeach the President for his crimes, then they must forever remain impervious to prosecution. Impeachment is a political process by which Congress can remove a President who has committed “Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.” Art. II, §4.

S., at 750, n. 31; see also Nixon, 418 U.

In his Farewell Address, George Washington reminded the Nation that “a Government of as much vigour as is consistent with the perfect security of Liberty is indispensable.” 35 Writings of George Washington 226 (J. Fitzpatrick ed. 1940). A government “too feeble to withstand the enterprises of faction,” he warned, could lead to the “frightful despotism” of “alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by the spirit of revenge.” Id., at 226–227. And the way to avoid that cycle, he explained, was to ensure that government powers remained “properly distributed and adjusted.” Id., at 226.  
    -   
    - It is these enduring principles that guide our decision in this case. The President enjoys no immunity for his unofficial acts, and not everything the President does is official. The President is not above the law. But Congress may not criminalize the President’s conduct in carrying out the responsibilities of the Executive Branch under the Constitution. And the system of separated powers designed by the Framers has always demanded an energetic, independent Executive. The President therefore may not be prosecuted for exercising his core constitutional powers, and he is entitled, at a minimum, to a presumptive immunity from prosecution for all his official acts. That immunity applies equally to all occupants of the Oval Office, regardless of politics, policy, or party.`

    - Chief Justice John Roberts, writing the majority opinion
        - The president has three broad types of immunity claims
            - "Core powers" that only the executive/president can perform.
                - Actions taken here are granted **absolute immunity.**
            - "Official powers" or "Overlapping powers" where the president OR some other branch could perform them.
                - Actions taken here are given **presumptive immunity**, meaning the burden is on the Government to prove that immunity should not be granted in this particular case, by proving that prosecuting a particular presidential act must pose "no dangers of intrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch."
            - "Unofficial" actions
                - Actions taken here are granted **no criminal immunity**, Roberts says that these actions must be "manifestly or palpably beyond [their] authority."
        - Any immunity granted for any actions also means those actions cannot be reviewed even if they were used in the furtherance of another crime.
        - Rulings on 4 major allegations brought up in the Opinion
            - Conversation between Trump and his Attorney General
                - The SC said this would be granted **absolute immunity**

    - `Few things would threaten our constitutional order more than criminally prosecuting a former President for his official acts. Fortunately, the Constitution does not permit us to chart such a dangerous course. As the Court forcefully explains, the Framers “deemed an energetic executive essential to . . . the security of liberty,” and our “system of separated powers” accordingly insulates the President from prosecution for his official acts.` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024)

    - > `There is an idea, which is not without its advocates, that a vigorous Executive is inconsistent with the genius of republican government. The enlightened well-wishers to this species of government must at least hope that the supposition is destitute of foundation; since they can never admit its truth, without at the same time admitting the condemnation of their own principles. Energy in the Executive is a leading character in the definition of good government. It is essential to the protection of the community against foreign attacks; it is not less essential to the steady administration of the laws; to the protection of property against those irregular and high-handed combinations which sometimes interrupt the ordinary course of justice; to the security of liberty against the enterprises and assaults of ambition, of faction, and of anarchy. Every man the least conversant in Roman story, knows how often that republic was obliged to take refuge in the absolute power of a single man, under the formidable title of Dictator, as well against the intrigues of ambitious individuals who aspired to the tyranny, and the seditions of whole classes of the community whose conduct threatened the existence of all government, as against the invasions of external enemies who menaced the conquest and destruction of Rome.  
    - >   
    - > There can be no need, however, to multiply arguments or examples on this head. A feeble Executive implies a feeble execution of the government.

    - > `But one of the weightiest objections to a plurality in the Executive, and which lies as much against the last as the first plan, is, that it tends to conceal faults and destroy responsibility. Responsibility is of two kinds to censure and to punishment. The first is the more important of the two, especially in an elective office. Man, in public trust, will much oftener act in such a manner as to render him unworthy of being any longer trusted, than in such a manner as to make him obnoxious to legal punishment. But the multiplication of the Executive adds to the difficulty of detection in either case. It often becomes impossible, amidst mutual accusations, to determine on whom the blame or the punishment of a pernicious measure, or series of pernicious measures, ought really to fall. It is shifted from one to another with so much dexterity, and under such plausible appearances, that the public opinion is left in suspense about the real author. The circumstances which may have led to any national miscarriage or misfortune are sometimes so complicated that, where there are a number of actors who may have had different degrees and kinds of agency, though we may clearly see upon the whole that there has been mismanagement, yet it may be impracticable to pronounce to whose account the evil which may have been incurred is truly chargeable. "I was overruled by my council. The council were so divided in their opinions that it was impossible to obtain any better resolution on the point.'' These and similar pretexts are constantly at hand, whether true or false. And who is there that will either take the trouble or incur the odium, of a strict scrunity into the secret springs of the transaction? Should there be found a citizen zealous enough to undertake the unpromising task, if there happen to be collusion between the parties concerned, how easy it is to clothe the circumstances with so much ambiguity, as to render it uncertain what was the precise conduct of any of those parties?` [link](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed70.asp) - The Federalist Papers: No.70, Alexander Hamilton

    - For reasons I explain below, I do not join Part III–C of the Court’s opinion. The remainder of the opinion is consistent with my view that the Constitution prohibits Congress from criminalizing a President’s exercise of core Article II powers and closely related conduct. That said, I would have framed the underlying legal issues differently. The Court describes the President’s constitutional protection from certain prosecutions as an “immunity.” As I see it, that term is shorthand for two propositions: The President can challenge the constitutionality of a criminal statute as applied to official acts alleged in the indictment, and he can obtain interlocutory review of the trial court’s ruling.`

Ante, at 15. Sorting private from official conduct sometimes will be difficult—but not always. Take the President’s alleged attempt to organize alternative slates of electors. See, e.g., App. 208. In my view, that conduct is private and therefore not entitled to protection. See post, at 27–28 (SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting). The Constitution vests power to appoint Presidential electors in the States. Art. II, §1, cl. 2; see also Chiafalo v. Washington, 591 U. S. 578, 588–589 (2020). And while Congress has a limited role in that process, see Art. II, §1, cls. 3–4, the President has none. In short, a President has no legal authority—and thus no official capacity—to influence how the States appoint their electors.

    - `First, the Framers clearly knew how to provide for immunity from prosecution. They did provide a narrow immunity for legislators in the Speech or Debate Clause. See Art. I, §6, cl. 1 (“Senators and Representatives . . . shall in all Cases, except Treason, Felony and Breach of the Peace, be privileged from Arrest during their Attendance at the Session of their respective Houses, and in going to and returning from the same; and for any Speech or Debate in either House, they shall not be questioned in any other Place”).

    - `Third, insofar as the Constitution does speak to this question, it actually contemplates some form of criminal liability for former Presidents. The majority correctly rejects Trump’s argument that a former President cannot be prosecuted unless he has been impeached by the House and convicted by the Senate for the same conduct. See ante, at 32–34; Part IV–C, infra. The majority ignores, however, that the Impeachment Judgment Clause cuts against its own position. That Clause presumes the availability of criminal process as a backstop by establishing that an official impeached and convicted by the Senate “shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.” Art. I, §3, cl. 7 (emphasis added). That Clause clearly contemplates that a former President may be subject to criminal prosecution for the same conduct that resulted (or could have resulted) in an impeachment judgment—including conduct such as “Bribery,” Art. II, §4, which implicates official acts almost by definition.` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024)
    
    - `At the Constitutional Convention, James Madison, who was aware that some state constitutions provided governors immunity, proposed that the Convention “conside[r] what privileges ought to be allowed to the Executive.” 2 Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, p. 503 (M. Farrand ed. 1911). There is no record of any such discussion. Ibid. Delegate Charles Pinckney later explained that “[t]he Convention which formed the Constitution well knew” that “no subject had been more abused than privilege,” and so it “determined to . . . limi[t] privilege to what was necessary, and no more.” 3 id., at 385. “No privilege . . . was intended for [the] Executive.”` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v.

    - > `To note, as the majority does, see ante, at 39, that this Court has recognized civil immunities arguably inconsistent with this view is not to say that Pinckney was wrong about what the Framers had “intended.” Indeed, Pinckney’s contemporaries shared the same view during the ratification debates. See, e.g., 4 Debates on the Constitution 109 (J. Elliot ed. 1836) (J. Iredell) (“If the President does a single act by which the people are prejudiced, he is punishable himself. . . . If he commits any crime, he is punishable by the laws of his country”).` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024)

If the President does a single act by which the people are prejudiced, he is punishable himself, and no other man merely to screen him. If he commits any misdemeanor in office, he is impeachable, removable from office, and incapacitated to hold any office of honor, trust, or profit. If he commits any crime, he is punishable by the laws of his country, and in capital cases may be deprived of his life. This being the case, there is not the same reason here for having a council which exists in England. It is, however, much to be desired, that a man who has such extensive and important business to perform should have the means of some assistance to enable him to discharge his arduous employment. The advice of the principal executive officers, which he can at all times command, will, in my opinion, answer this valuable purpose. He can at no time want advice, if he desires it, as the principal officers will always be on the spot. Those officers, from their abilities and experience, will probably be able to give as good, if not better, advice than any counsellors would do; and the solemnity of the advice in writing, which must be preserved, would be a great check upon them.` [link](https://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a2_2_1s13.html) - James Iredell, Debates on the Constitution 109
    
    - `This historical evidence reinforces that, from the very beginning, the presumption in this Nation has always been that no man is free to flout the criminal law.

With nothing on its side of the ledger, the most the majority can do is claim that the historical evidence is a wash. See ante, at 38–39.

Moreover, far from dismissing that evidence as irrelevant, the Fitzgerald Court was careful to note that “[t]he best historical evidence clearly support[ed]” the immunity from damages liability that it recognized, and it relied in part on that historical evidence to overcome the lack of any textual basis for its immunity. Id., at 152, n. 31. The majority ignores this reliance. It seems history matters to this Court only when it is convenient. See, e.g., New York State Rifle & Pistol Assn., Inc. v. Bruen, 597 U. S. 1 (2022); Dobbs, 597 U. S. 215.` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024)
    
    - `Consider Watergate, for example. After the Watergate tapes revealed President Nixon’s misuse of official power to obstruct the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s investigation of the Watergate burglary, President Ford pardoned Nixon. Both Ford’s pardon and Nixon’s acceptance of the pardon necessarily “rested on the understanding that the former President faced potential criminal liability.” Brief for United States 15; see also Public Papers of the Presidents, Gerald R. Ford, Vol. 1, Sept. 8, 1974, p. 103 (1975) (granting former President Nixon a “full, free, and absolute pardon . . . for all offenses against the United States which he . . . has committed or may have committed or taken part in during” his Presidency); R. Nixon, Statement by Former President Richard Nixon to P. Buchen, Counsel to President Ford, p. 1 (Sept. 8, 1974) (accepting “full and absolute pardon for any charges which might be brought against me for actions taken during the time I was President of the United States”).` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024)
    
    - `Indeed, Trump’s own lawyers during his second impeachment trial assured Senators that declining to impeach Trump for his conduct related to January 6 would not leave him “in any way above the law.” 2 Proceedings of the U. S. Senate in the Impeachment Trial of Donald John Trump, S. Doc. 117–2, p. 144 (2021). They insisted that a former President “is like any other citizen and can be tried in a court of law.” Ibid.; see also 1 id., S. Doc. 117–3, at 339 (Trump’s impeachment counsel stating that “no former officeholder is immune” from the judicial process “for investigation, prosecution, and punishment”); id., at 322–323 (Trump’s impeachment counsel stating: “If my colleagues on this side of the Chamber actually think that President Trump committed a criminal offense . . . [a]fter he is out of office, you go and arrest him”). Now that Trump is facing criminal charges for those acts, though, the tune has changed. Being treated “like any other citizen” no longer seems so appealing.` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024)
    
    - `the majority announces that former Presidents are “absolute[ly],” or “at least . . . presumptive[ly],” immune from criminal prosecution for all of their official acts. Ante, at 14 (emphasis omitted). The majority purports to keep us in suspense as to whether this immunity is absolute or presumptive, but it quickly gives up the game. It explains that, “[a]t a minimum, the President must . . . be immune from prosecution for an official act unless the Government can show that applying a criminal prohibition to that act would pose no ‘dangers of intrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch.’ ” Ibid. (emphasis added). No dangers, none at all. It is hard to imagine a criminal prosecution for a President’s official acts that would pose no dangers of intrusion on Presidential authority in the majority’s eyes. Nor should that be the standard. Surely some intrusions on the Executive may be “justified by an overriding need to promote objectives within the constitutional authority of Congress.” Nixon v. Administrator of General Services, 433 U. S. 425, 443 (1977). Other intrusions may be justified by the “primary constitutional duty of the Judicial Branch to do justice in criminal prosecutions.” United States v. Nixon, 418 U. S. 683, 707 (1974). According to the majority, however, any incursion on Executive power is too much. When presumptive immunity is this conclusive, the majority’s indecision as to “whether [official-acts] immunity must be absolute” or whether, instead, “presumptive immunity is sufficient,” ante, at 6, hardly matters.` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024)
    
    - `Quick on the heels of announcing this astonishingly broad official-acts immunity, the majority assures us that a former President can still be prosecuted for “unofficial acts.” Ante, at 15. Of course he can. No one has questioned the ability to prosecute a former President for unofficial (otherwise known as private) acts. Even Trump did not claim immunity for such acts and, as the majority acknowledges, such an immunity would be impossible to square with Clinton v. Jones, 520 U. S. 681 (1997). See ante, at 15. This unremarkable proposition is no real limit on today’s decision. It does not hide the majority’s embrace of the most far-reaching view of Presidential immunity on offer.  
    -   
    - In fact, the majority’s dividing line between “official” and “unofficial” conduct narrows the conduct considered “unofficial” almost to a nullity. It says that whenever the President acts in a way that is “ ‘not manifestly or palpably beyond [his] authority,’ ” he is taking official action. Ante, at 17 (quoting Blassingame v. Trump, 87 F. 4th 1, 13 (CADC 2023)). It then goes a step further: “In dividing official from unofficial conduct, courts may not inquire into the President’s motives.” Ante, at 18. It is one thing to say that motive is irrelevant to questions regarding the scope of civil liability, but it is quite another to make it irrelevant to questions regarding criminal liability. Under that rule, any use of official power for any purpose, even the most corrupt purpose indicated by objective evidence of the most corrupt motives and intent, remains official and immune. Under the majority’s test, if it can be called a test, the category of Presidential action that can be deemed “unofficial” is destined to be vanishingly small.  
    -   
    - Ultimately, the majority pays lip service to the idea that “[t]he President, charged with enforcing federal criminal laws, is not above them,” ante, at 13–14, but it then proceeds to place former Presidents beyond the reach of the federal criminal laws for any abuse of official power.`  
    - [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024)
    
    - `In the context of a federal criminal prosecution of a former President, however, the danger to the functioning of the Executive Branch is much reduced. Further, as every member of the Fitzgerald Court acknowledged, see Part IVB–2, infra, the public interest in a criminal prosecution is far weightier. Applying the Fitzgerald balancing here should yield the opposite result. Instead, the majority elides any difference between civil and criminal immunity, granting Trump the same immunity from criminal prosecution that Nixon enjoyed from an unlawful termination suit. That is plainly wrong.` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024)
    
    - `Indeed, a former President is likely to have legal arguments that would be unavailable to the average criminal defendant. For example, he may be able to rely on a public-authority exception from particular criminal laws,3 or an advice-of-the-Attorney-General defense, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 107–108.4` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024)
    
    - `If the case nonetheless makes it to trial, the Government will bear the burden of proving every element of the alleged crime beyond a reasonable doubt to a unanimous jury of the former President’s fellow citizens. See United States v. Gaudin, 515 U. S. 506, 510 (1995). If the Government manages to overcome even that significant hurdle, then the former President can appeal his conviction, and the appellate review of his claims will be “ ‘particularly meticulous.’ ” Trump v. Vance, 591 U. S. 786, 809 (2020) (quoting Nixon, 418 U. S., at 702). He can ultimately seek this Court’s review, and if past practice (including in this case) is any indication, he will receive it.  
    -   
    - In light of these considerable protections, the majority’s fear that “ ‘bare allegations of malice,’ ” ante, at 18 (alteration omitted), would expose former Presidents to trial and conviction is unfounded. Bare allegations of malice would not make it out of the starting gate. Although a private civil action may be brought based on little more than “ ‘intense feelings,’ ” ante, at 11 (quoting Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 752), a federal criminal prosecution is made of firmer stuff. Certainly there has been, on occasion, great feelings of animosity between incoming and outgoing Presidents over the course of our country’s history. Yet it took allegations as grave as those at the center of this case to have the first federal criminal prosecution of a former President. That restraint is telling.  
    -   
    - Third, because of longstanding interpretations by the Executive Branch, every sitting President has so far believed himself under the threat of criminal liability after his term in office and nevertheless boldly fulfilled the duties of his office. The majority insists that the threat of criminal sanctions is “more likely to distort Presidential decisionmaking than the potential payment of civil damages.” Ante, at 13. If that is right, then that distortion has been shaping Presidential decisionmaking since the earliest days of the Republic. Although it makes sense to avoid “diversion of the President’s attention during the decisionmaking process” with “needless worry,” Clinton, 520 U. S., at 694, n. 19, one wonders why requiring some small amount of his attention (or his legal advisers’ attention) to go towards complying with federal criminal law is such a great burden. If the President follows the law that he must “take Care” to execute, Art. II, §3, he has not been rendered “ ‘unduly cautious,’ ” ante, at 10 (quoting Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 752, n. 32). Some amount of caution is necessary, after all. It is a far greater danger if the President feels empowered to violate federal criminal law, buoyed by the knowledge of future immunity. I am deeply troubled by the idea, inherent in the majority’s opinion, that our Nation loses something valuable when the President is forced to operate within the confines of federal criminal law.`

    - Sonia Sotomayor, with whom Elena Kagan and Kentaji Jackson join, dissenting
        - Sotomayor argues in five parts
            - That the immunity is legally and historically inconsistent
                - Some state constitution actually did provide for criminal immunity for sitting governors, this was not included in the US Constitution.
                - Art I §3 C7 gives us the "_nevertheless_" for criminal prosecution, and things like bribery are official acts for which one can be impeached, so any citations of this part of the Constitution seem to imply that criminalizing official conduct was textually supported by the Constitution.
                - Sotomayor makes reference to other historical arguments that support the criminal charging of public officials acting in their official capacity.
            - That it is "deeply wrong"
            - That the "core" immunity is misguided and not needed
                - The difference between an official and unofficial act and the inability to probe motives or intents of anything that can be even slightly construed as an official act essentially nullifies almost all criminal law from applying to almost all presidential actions.
                - The civil vs criminal balancing test is not appropriately applied, since the public has a greater interest in criminal prosecution than it does in private suits, the executive branch should need to provide a greater reason, not a lesser one, to evade such liability.
            - The evidentiary holding is unprecedented
            - And that the ruling will have disastrous consequences
        - There are many more safeguards and protections built into criminal suits vs private action.
        - The court, even though it rejected Trump's arguments that impeachment must precede any criminal indictment, actually grants more immunity by claiming even actions by which a president is impeached for cannot be criminal charged.
        - Sotomayor challenges the logic that juries might be biased against a president's "official-acts" due to their bias against their administration, however, that same logic would likely extend to literally every single act of a president, including non-official acts for other private suits.
        - Roberts remanded 3 actions back to the lower courts for analysis, but for some reason thought it appropriate to declare the conversations Trump had with the AG as qualifying for absolute immunity with zero lower court consideration or analysis first.
        - She points out that Roberts goes further than what the defendants were even asking for, noting that even when they've conceded some acts as private, Roberts is saying they may not be.

    - Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, dissenting
        - Jackson points out the ludicrousness of the majority calling this a "Separation of Powers" question.
        - Says that majority claims that the president must commit crimes in order to do his job.
        - She points out that the Judges and Prosecutors themselves must assume a role of quasi-jury, judging whether a particular action was official or criminal in nature before any trial has even begun.
        - This ruling has allowed the court to snatch power from the Legislature and give it to the Court and the Executive, as they are now making determinations of who the law applies to.
        - "Core powers" aren't even very well defined in the Constitution.

- In March 2022, Trump filed a RICO lawsuit against Hillary Clinton, the Democratic National Committee, and dozens of Democrats, "alleging that they 'maliciously conspired to weave a false narrative that [Trump] was colluding with a hostile foreign sovereignty [Russia]' to try and rig the 2016 election." He demanded a jury trial and compensatory damages of at least $24 million.

- In September, US District Judge Donald M. Middlebrooks dismissed the suit, stating that it "ignored existing laws, U.S, Supreme Court precedent, and basic legal theory."

### 2024 House Oversight Committee Report `White House for Sale`
- On 4 January 2024, the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability released a report called `White House for Sale: How Princes, Prime Ministers, and Premiers Paid Off President Trump` detailing Trump’s receipt of payments from foreign governments and foreign state-owned or state-controlled entities while in office between 2017-18.
- The reports central findings were:
    
    - ` ` [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20240104150937/https://oversightdemocrats.house.gov/sites/democrats.oversight.house.gov/files/2024-01-04.COA%20DEMS%20-%20Mazars%20Report.pdf)
    
- The Conclusions
    
    - `This report has documented the payment of many millions of dollars in unconstitutional emoluments to Trump-owned businesses from at least 20 foreign governments as well as entities and lobbyists acting on their behalf. As noted, given the incompleteness of the documents received by the Committee and Chairman Comer’s decision to act in concert with former President Trump’s attorneys to block the production of additional records, this total is likely but a small fraction of the full universe of foreign emolument spending that took place during the Trump presidency in violation of the U.S. Constitution.  
    -   
    - President Trump’s pervasive use of the presidency for personal financial gain is particularly alarming given not only the significant dollar amounts and multiplicity of countries involved, but also former President Trump’s repeated indications of his willingness to allow his personal financial interest to dictate policy decisions he made as President. The rich profits that Trump businesses reaped from those countries, at best, leaves subject to question whether the often favorable treatment they received from the Trump Administration resulted from the former President’s bona fide judgment about advancing the vital interests of the United States, or his desire to perpetuate the substantial personal enrichment he enjoyed from the lavish emolument spending by those countries.  
    -   
    - As he accepted these payments, Mr. Trump ignored the Foreign Emolument Clause’s explicit requirement that he obtain congressional authorization before pocketing such gifts—never even seeking, let alone securing, the consent of Congress to his receipt of these large-scale emoluments. No president has ever come so close to brazenly ignoring the Foreign Emoluments Clause.  
    -   
    - These facts demonstrate the need for urgent congressional action to prevent future presidents and senior officials from serving under similarly grave conflicts of interest and unconstitutional arrangements. Accordingly, this report recommends that Congress expeditiously consider adopting measures that would require presidents and senior executive officials to disclose to Congress their receipt of any foreign emoluments, set forth an explicit procedure for presidents and senior officials to seek the requisite congressional authorization for the receipt and retention of emoluments, and require the disclosure of payments to entities in which a sitting president has a financial interest “of any kind whatever” by officials and lobbyists acting on behalf of kings, princes, and foreign governments.`
