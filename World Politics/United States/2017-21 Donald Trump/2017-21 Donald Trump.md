## Immigration Policy
### The Wall
- As a promise during his last campaign, it seems it's been nothing but disaster for Trump regarding the issue. Trump promised to build a wall along the border's entire 2,000-mile length. Trump signed a declaration of National Emergency, saying that the situation at the U.S.–Mexico border is a crisis requiring money allocated for other purposes to be used to build the wall. [link](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/02/20/2019-03011/declaring-a-national-emergency-concerning-the-southern-border-of-the-united-states)
- A major premise of the wall was that `Mexico would pay for the wall`. On Day 6 of Trump’s administration, the Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto rejected the idea that Mexico would pay for any border wall between the United States and his country. [link](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/mexican-president-vows-protect-immigrants-inside-united-states-n712321)
- Not very much has been built of it, On December 17, 2019, acting Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection Mark Morgan stated that 93 miles of new wall has been built during the Trump administration; according to CBP figures, at least 90 miles of that replaced existing structures. [link](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-border-idUSKBN1YL2FB)
- On September 1, 2020, The U.S. Customs and Border Protection then updated the number to 321 Miles. This is still only 16% of the wall from the previous 4.7% at the end of 2019. [link](https://www.cbp.gov/border-security/along-us-borders/border-wall-system)
- On November 16, 2020, The U.S. Customs and Border Protection then updated the number to 402 Miles. This is still only 20% of the wall from the previous 16% on September 1, 2020. [link](https://www.cbp.gov/border-security/along-us-borders/border-wall-system)
- Trump wanted to build the wall to keep out illegal immigrants crossing the southern border. Why when the number of Mexican immigrants living in the U.S. illegally has declined by 2 million since 2007. In 2017, 4.9 million unauthorized immigrants from Mexico lived in the U.S., down from a peak of 6.9 million in 2007. Mexicans now make up fewer than half of the nation’s 10.5 million unauthorized immigrants (47% in 2017). [link](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/06/28/what-we-know-about-illegal-immigration-from-mexico/)
- Not only this but at the U.S.-Mexico border, there have been more apprehensions of non-Mexicans than Mexicans every year since fiscal 2016. Non-Mexicans accounted for 62% of apprehensions at the southwest border in fiscal 2018, [link](https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2019-Mar/bp-total-apps-other-mexico-fy2000-fy2018.pdf) marking the third consecutive year in which they outnumbered Mexicans. In fiscal 2018, which ended Sept. 30, the Border Patrol made 152,257 apprehensions of Mexicans. This is a sharp drop from a recent peak of 1.6 million apprehensions in fiscal 2000, when Mexicans accounted for 98% of apprehensions. The decline in apprehensions reflects a decrease in the number of unauthorized Mexican immigrants coming to the U.S. [link](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/06/28/what-we-know-about-illegal-immigration-from-mexico/)
- The Department of Homeland Security records that most undocumented immigrants didn't enter this country through the southern border. About 660,000 travelers to the United States overstayed their visas in fiscal 2018, the most recent year for which the Department of Homeland Security has published figures. DHS estimated that, as of Sept. 30, 2018, the end of that fiscal year, more than 560,000 of those travelers were still in the U.S. [link](https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/19_0417_fy18-entry-and-exit-overstay-report.pdf)
- So why did Trump want to build the wall? Trump said `I think much of the drugs — the big loads of drugs, and certainly the human traffickers, go not through the ports of entry; they go through the open areas where they don’t have walls. These folks know that better than anybody.` [link](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-briefing-drug-trafficking-southern-border/)
- CBP statistics show 81 percent of the 265,500 pounds of hard drugs caught at the U.S.-Mexico border from fiscal year 2012 to fiscal year 2016 were stopped by customs officers at ports of entry, rather than by Border Patrol agents working in the desert and wilderness between ports. [[article_]] [link](https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2017-Mar/FY-2016-CBP-PAR-508C.pdf)
- Even if a wall could stop all drugs from Mexico, America’s drug problem would be far from over. The U.S. Centers on Disease Control and Prevention says about 40 percent of opioid deaths in 2016 involved prescription painkillers. Those drugs are made by pharmaceutical companies. Some feed the addiction of people who have prescriptions; others are stolen and sold on the black market. Moreover, illicit versions of powerful synthetic opioids such as fentanyl have come to the U.S. from China. [link](https://globalnews.ca/news/4867699/donald-trump-border-wall-fact-check-drug-smuggling/) [link](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2018/p0329-drug-overdose-deaths.html)
- Trump’s National Emergency is still in effect and Biden plans to `End the so-called National Emergency that siphons federal dollars from the Department of Defense to build a wall. Building a wall will do little to deter criminals and cartels seeking to exploit our borders. Instead of stealing resources from schools for military children and recovery efforts in Puerto Rico, Biden will direct federal resources to smart border enforcement efforts, like investments in improving screening infrastructure at our ports of entry, that will actually keep America safer.` [link](https://joebiden.com/immigration/)
- Biden has said `Building a wall from sea-to-shining-sea is not a serious policy solution–it’s a waste of money, and it diverts critical resources away from the real threats. Today, illicit drugs are most likely to be smuggled through one of the legal U.S. ports of entry. They are hidden among commercial cargo in semi-trucks or in a hidden compartment of a passenger vehicle.`
- Biden has said `A wall is not a serious deterrent for sophisticated criminal organizations that employ border tunnels, semi-submersible vessels, and aerial technology to overcome physical barriers at the border–or even for individuals with a reciprocating saw.`
### Open Borders
- Trump has previously attacked Open Borders activists saying `Today I have a message for those open border activists who cloak themselves in the rhetoric of social justice: your policies are not just. Your policies are cruel and evil,` [link](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-un-assembly-trump-immigration/trump-in-u-n-speech-attacks-policies-of-open-border-activists-as-evil-idUSKBN1W91ZQ)
- Open borders among economists and other academics seems like a settled issue on the topic.
- A 2014 Cato institute paper asserts that most studies state the fiscal impact of immigration being negligible, and cites many ways that immigrants have had positive impacts on the economy, and predicts that future immigration should have no dramatic fiscal impact. [link](https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/working-paper-21-fix.pdf)
- A 2017 report by the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine asserts `Immigration's Long-Term Impacts on Overall Wages and Employment of Native-Born U.S. Workers Very Small, Although Low-Skilled Workers May Be Affected, New Report Finds; Impacts on Economic Growth Positive, While Effects on Government Budgets Mixed.` `When measured over a period of 10 years or more, the impact of immigration on the wages of native-born workers overall is very small.` `Immigration has an overall positive impact on long-run economic growth in the U.S.` [link](https://www.nationalacademies.org/news/2016/09/new-report-assesses-the-economic-and-fiscal-consequences-of-immigration)
- Even illegal immigrants put into the system in unexpected ways, `Stephen Goss, the chief actuary of the Social Security Administration (SSA), told VICE News that an estimated 7 million people are currently working in the US illegally. Of those, he estimates that about 3.1 million are using fake or expired social security numbers, yet also paying automatic payroll taxes. Goss believes that these workers pay an annual net contribution of $12 billion to the Social Security Trust Fund.` [link](https://news.vice.com/article/unauthorized-immigrants-paid-100-billion-into-social-security-over-last-decade)
- George Borjas, in the totality of his immigration studies, one of the most cited `anti-immigration` economists, asserts that immigration has a net wash impact on fiscal budgets. [link](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/09/trump-clinton-immigration-economy-unemployment-jobs-214216)
- According to a 2014 Report from the US Census, `The Foreign-Born Population From Africa: 2008–2012` black African immigrants in general have higher degrees compared to white people, with 41% of African immigrants having degrees compared to only 36% of native white people. The same report shows that 60.9% of Nigerians in the US have a Bachelor’s degree or higher. [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20170211043615/https://census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2014/acs/acsbr12-16.pdf)
- A 2012 report by the US Census `The Foreign-Born Population in the United States: 2010,` shows that If you come from Africa you have a 10% higher chance of having a Bachelor’s degree than if you came from Europe. [link](https://www.census.gov/prod/2012pubs/acs-19.pdf)
- Nigerians are the most educated immigrant population in the United States. `Although they make up a tiny portion of the U.S. population, a whopping 17 percent of all Nigerians in this country held master's degrees while 4 percent had a doctorate, according to the 2006 American Community Survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau.` [link](http://www.chron.com/news/article/Data-show-Nigerians-the-most-educated-in-the-U-S-1600808.php)
- Biden is in favour of `Protect Dreamers and their families. The Obama-Biden Administration created DACA in 2012 to protect “Dreamers,” undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children, obeyed the law once here, and stayed in school or enlisted in the military. DACA provided young people who passed a background check and application process with temporary work permits and protection from deportation. The Trump Administration made the cruel and counterproductive decision to terminate DACA, throwing into turmoil the lives of millions of Dreamers.’ [link](https://joebiden.com/immigration/)
- Biden also is in support of `Restore sensible enforcement priorities. Targeting people who have never been convicted of a serious criminal offense and who have lived, worked, and contributed to our economy and our communities for decades is the definition of counterproductive. Biden will direct enforcement efforts toward threats to public safety and national security, while ensuring that individuals are treated with the due process to which they are entitled and their human rights are protected.` [link](https://joebiden.com/immigration/)
- Biden also is in support of ‘Revitalize the Task Force on New Americans and boost our economy by prioritizing integration, promoting immigrant entrepreneurship, increasing access to language instruction, and promoting civil engagement. Integrating the talents of new immigrants into our communities and helping them to thrive enriches our nation and our economy. Under President Biden, the Task Force on New Americans will once more coordinate federal agencies and resources to provide community support across a range of issues, including language learning, entrepreneurship and financial management, workforce training, and guidance on the naturalization process.` [link](https://joebiden.com/immigration/)
### Mass deportation of illegal immigrants
- In August 2015, during his campaign, Trump proposed the mass deportation of illegal aliens as a part of his immigration policy. [link](http://www.politico.com/story/2015/08/donald-trump-immigration-plan-121420) According to analysts, Trump’s mass-deportation plan would encounter legal and logistical difficulties, since U.S. immigration courts already face large backlogs. [[messylegalprocesscouldch]]
- Such a program would also impose a fiscal cost; the fiscally conservative American Action Forum policy group estimates that deporting every illegal immigrant would cause a slump of $381.5 billion to $623.2 billion in private sector output, amounting to roughly a loss of 2% of U.S. GDP. [link](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-trump-deportations-idUSKCN0XW0TP) Doug Holtz-Eakin, the group's president, has said that the mass deportation of 11 million people would `harm the economy in ways it would normally not be harmed`. [[messylegalprocesscouldch]]
- In a Cato Report, using US Census Data from the American Community Survey, titled `Criminal Immigrants: Their Numbers, Demographics, and Countries of Origin,` even illegal immigrants commit less crime than natives with .84% of them being incarcerated compared to 1.53% of the native population. [link](https://www.cato.org/publications/immigration-reform-bulletin/criminal-immigrants-their-numbers-demographics-countries)
- In a Pew Research study, it also seems as if they were almost better off not integrating as second generation immigrants are observed to commit a fraction less crime than native born but more likely to commit crime compared to first generation immigrants. [link](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/10/15/crime-rises-among-second-generation-immigrants-as-they-assimilate/)
- `Stephen Goss, the chief actuary of the Social Security Administration (SSA), told VICE News that an estimated 7 million people are currently working in the US illegally. Of those, he estimates that about 3.1 million are using fake or expired social security numbers, yet also paying automatic payroll taxes. Goss believes that these workers pay an annual net contribution of $12 billion to the Social Security Trust Fund.` [link](https://news.vice.com/article/unauthorized-immigrants-paid-100-billion-into-social-security-over-last-decade)
- They contribute in countless ways to our communities, workforce, and economy. In 2015, the IRS collected $23.6 billion from 4.4 million workers without Social Security numbers–many of whom were undocumented. [link](https://www.vox.com/2018/4/13/17229018/undocumented-immigrants-pay-taxes)
- Biden is in support of `Restore and defend the naturalization process for green card holders. A Biden Administration will streamline and improve the naturalization process to make it more accessible to qualified green card holders. The Trump Administration has made it far too difficult for qualifying green card holders to obtain citizenship. Quite simply, this is wrong. Biden will restore faith in the citizenship process by removing roadblocks to naturalization and obtaining the right to vote, addressing the application backlog by prioritizing the adjudication workstream and ensuring applications are processed quickly, and rejecting the imposition of unreasonable fees.` [link](https://joebiden.com/immigration/)
- Biden is in support of `Creates a roadmap to citizenship for the nearly 11 million people who have been living in and strengthening our country for years. These are our mothers, fathers, brothers, and sisters. They are our neighbors, co-workers, and members of our congregations and Little League teams. They contribute in countless ways to our communities, workforce, and economy. In 2015, the IRS collected $23.6 billion from 4.4 million workers without Social Security numbers–many of whom were undocumented. Biden will aggressively advocate for legislation that creates a clear roadmap to legal status and citizenship for unauthorized immigrants who register, are up-to-date on their taxes, and have passed a background check.` [link](https://joebiden.com/immigration/)
- Biden is in support of `Provides a path to legalization for agricultural workers who have worked for years on U.S. farms and continue to work in agriculture. Securing adequate, seasonal help in the agricultural sector can be inefficient and difficult to navigate, causing people to avoid or exploit the system, even when jobs remain unfilled. Biden supports compromise legislation between farmworkers and the agricultural sector that will provide legal status based on prior agricultural work history, and a faster-track to a green card and ultimately citizenship.` [link](https://joebiden.com/immigration/)
### Trump's Attempts to remove DACA
- Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) allows some individuals with unlawful presence in the United States after being brought to the country as children to receive a renewable two-year period of deferred action from deportation and become eligible for a work permit in the U.S. To be eligible for the program, recipients cannot have felonies or serious misdemeanors on their records. Unlike the proposed DREAM Act, DACA does not provide a path to citizenship for recipients. The policy, an executive branch memorandum, was announced by President Barack Obama on June 15, 2012. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) began accepting applications for the program on August 15, 2012. [link](https://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1107&context=cjlpp)
- In November 2014, President Obama announced his intention to expand DACA to cover additional undocumented immigrants. Under President Trump, the Department of Homeland Security rescinded the expansion in June 2017, while it continued to review the existence of DACA as a whole. In September 2017, the Trump Administration announced a plan to phase out DACA. The government deferred implementation of this plan for six months to allow Congress time to pass the Dream Act or some other legislative protection for Dreamers. Congress failed to act and the time extension expired on March 5, 2018, but the phase-out of DACA has been put on hold by several courts. On August 31, 2018, District Court Judge Andrew Hanen ruled that DACA is likely unconstitutional. However, he let the program remain in place as litigation proceeds. [link](https://www.npr.org/2018/08/31/643814735/texas-judge-says-daca-is-probably-illegal-but-leaves-it-in-place) As of April 2020, the cancellation of the program is on hold by court order; a Supreme Court decision on the matter is expected by summer 2020. [link](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/9/13/20864168/democratic-debate-protesters-daca-recipients)
- A 2016 study in the Journal of Public Economics found that DACA increased labor force participation and decreased the unemployment rate for DACA-eligible immigrants. DACA also increased the income of undocumented immigrants in the bottom of the income distribution. The study estimates that DACA moved 50,000 to 75,000 unauthorized immigrants into employment. [link](https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.jpubeco.2016.08.014)
- According to University of California, Davis economist Giovanni Peri, DACA consequently `increases consumption and overall demand for U.S. services, products, and jobs where the DACA recipients live and spend. Economists have shown that highly skilled workers increase local productivity and create opportunities for the other workers too`. [link](http://econofact.org/the-economic-cost-of-repealing-daca)
- A 2016 study in Economics Letters found that DACA-eligible households were 38% less likely than non-eligible unauthorized immigrant households to live in poverty. [link](https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.econlet.2016.08.001) Furthermore, DACA-eligible workers tend to have higher-skilled, higher-paying jobs than undocumented immigrants. [link](http://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-daca-and-how-much-will-it-cost-the-us-2017-9)
- A 2018 National Bureau of Economic Research paper found that DACA likely led to greater productivity by increasing the college attendance and employment of DACA-eligible individuals. [link](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.20180352)
- Peri argues that DACA recipients likely have a significant net positive fiscal impact given that DACA-eligible individuals have similar characteristics as second-generation immigrants, and that research shows that second-generation immigrants have a net positive fiscal impact of $173,000 to $259,000 per immigrant. Peri also notes that the U.S. public school system has already invested in educating these individuals, and they are at the point at which they can start contributing to the U.S. economy and public coffers; deporting them or increasing the likelihood that they are deported is economically counterproductive. [link](http://econofact.org/the-economic-cost-of-repealing-daca)
- A 2017 study by the Center for American Progress estimated that the loss of all DACA-eligible workers would reduce U.S. GDP by $433 billion over the next 10 years [link](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/immigration/news/2017/01/09/296125/ending-daca-will-cost-states-billions-of-dollars/) Another 2017 study by the Center for American Progress estimated that DACA recipients will contribute about $460.3 billion to the national GDP over the next decade. [link](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/immigration/news/2017/07/21/436419/new-threat-daca-cost-states-billions-dollars/)
- Biden is in favour of `Protect Dreamers and their families. The Obama-Biden Administration created DACA in 2012 to protect “Dreamers,” undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children, obeyed the law once here, and stayed in school or enlisted in the military. DACA provided young people who passed a background check and application process with temporary work permits and protection from deportation. The Trump Administration made the cruel and counterproductive decision to terminate DACA, throwing into turmoil the lives of millions of Dreamers.’ [link](https://joebiden.com/immigration/)
- Biden is in favour to `Immediately reverse the Trump Administration’s cruel and senseless policies that separate parents from their children at our border, including ending the prosecution of parents for minor immigration violations as an intimidation tactic, and prioritize the reunification of any children still separated from their families.’ [link](https://joebiden.com/immigration/)

### Climate Change Denial
- Trump in 2016, he was asked `You think climate change is a real thing? Is there human-caused climate change?` and he responded `I think there’s a change in weather. I am not a great believer in man-made climate change.` [link](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2016/03/22/donald-trumps-unsettling-nonsense-on-weather-and-climate/)
- Trump in 2015 made a speech for the paris climate committee before leaving the accord and said `We’re going to deal with real environmental challenges, not the phony ones we’ve been hearing about.`. [[dona]]
- Trump in 2018 was interviewed on `60 Minutes` following both Hurricane Michael and the release of the latest IPCC report and said `I’m not denying climate change. But it could very well go back.` interviewer disagrees and brings up consensus and says `Show me the scientists` [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7vYkX-WVs)
- Trump in 2018 was interviewed by Piers Morgan and was asked about if climate change is real, he said `The ice caps were going to melt. They were going to melt. They were going to be gone by now, but now they’re setting records, so OK, they’re at a record level.` [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYWsTHbDIm8)
- The consensus on the acknowledgement of climate change has been consistent for many years
- In 2001 Following the publication of the IPCC Third Assessment Report, seventeen national science academies issued a joint statement, entitled `The Science of Climate Change`, explicitly acknowledging the IPCC position as representing the scientific consensus on climate change science. [link](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/292/5520/1261)
- In 2007 In preparation for the 33rd G8 summit, the Network of African Science Academies submitted a joint `statement on sustainability, energy efficiency, and climate change`: A consensus, based on current evidence, now exists within the global scientific community that human activities are the main source of climate change and that the burning of fossil fuels is largely responsible for driving this change. The IPCC should be congratulated for the contribution it has made to public understanding of the nexus that exists between energy, climate and sustainability. [link](https://nasaconline.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Joint-Statement-by-NASAC-to-G8-on-Sustainability-Energy-efficiency-and-Cli.pdf)
- In 2009 In advance of the UNFCCC negotiations to be held in Copenhagen in December 2009, the national science academies of the G8+5 nations issued a joint statement declaring, `Climate change and sustainable energy supply are crucial challenges for the future of humanity. It is essential that world leaders agree on the emission reductions needed to combat negative consequences of anthropogenic climate change`. The statement references the IPCC's Fourth Assessment of 2007, and asserts that `climate change is happening even faster than previously estimated; global CO2 emissions since 2000 have been higher than even the highest predictions, Arctic sea ice has been melting at rates much faster than predicted, and the rise in the sea level has become more rapid`. The thirteen signatories were the same national science academies that issued the 2007 and 2008 joint statements. [link](https://www.nationalacademies.org/includes/G8+5energy-climate09.pdf)
### Paris Climate Accord
- The quotes that follow are taken from Trump’s June 1, 2017, statement withdrawing the United States from the Paris climate agreement, which united 195 countries in a pact to reduce greenhouse gas emissions globally. [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3wE7MO1uSw)
- 1. `The Paris climate accord is simply the latest example of Washington entering into an agreement that disadvantages the United States to the exclusive benefit of other countries, leaving American workers—who I love—and taxpayers to absorb the cost in terms of lost jobs, lower wages, shuttered factories, and vastly diminished economic production.`
- Under international law, the United States can leave the agreement only according to the terms laid out in the agreement. [link](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=99b794c4-5c1a-44f4-ae44-50528e152cfe) The Paris Agreement prevents countries from withdrawing until `three years from the date on which [it] has entered into force.` The agreement took effect on November 4, 2016, so the United States legally cannot give notice until November 4, 2019―and notification won’t take effect until November 4, 2020, after the next presidential election.
- Furthermore, three leading members of the European Union say the agreement is not open to renegotiation. These nations―France, Germany, and Italy―also reaffirmed their `commitment to swiftly implement` the deal in a rare joint statement following Trump’s remarks. [link](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-climatechange-eu-idUSKBN18S6GN)
- 2. `Thus, as of today, the United States will cease all implementation of the nonbinding Paris accord and the draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country.`
- A nonbinding agreement, by definition, cannot impose burdens of any kind on a signatory. All national commitments in the Paris accord are voluntary and determined by the individual countries themselves. [link](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nonbinding)
- 3. `China will be able to increase these emissions by a staggering number of years—13. They can do whatever they want for 13 years. Not us.`
- China committed to reduce its carbon intensity (carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP) by 60 to 65 percent of 2005 levels. [link](https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/paris-climate-conference-China-IB.pdf) This commitment recognizes that China’s economy is still developing and means that China’s carbon dioxide emissions cannot grow faster than the Chinese economy. China’s carbon dioxide emissions must top out by 2030.
- China already has the most solar and wind power capacity in the world, having installed nearly two times as many solar panels and three times as much wind power in 2016 as the United States. [link](https://www.nrdc.org/experts/alvin-lin/trump-reverses-progress-climate-while-china-marches-ahead) China is the world’s largest investor in renewable energy. It committed $88.2 billion in 2016 to renewables, compared with the U.S. investment of $58.8 billion, and in January 2017, [link](https://about.bnef.com/blog/record-30bn-year-offshore-wind-overall-investment/) it announced plans to invest $360 billion through 2020 and create 13 million clean energy jobs. [link](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-energy-renewables-idUSKBN14P06P)
- Biden is in support of `Re-enter the Paris Agreement on day one of the Biden Administration and lead a major diplomatic push to raise the ambitions of countries’ climate targets. The Paris Agreement was a historic breakthrough for the world, and reflected the power of patient, strategic diplomacy in service of America’s long-term national interests. The core of the agreement relies on countries continually increasing the ambition of their climate targets over time.` [link](https://joebiden.com/climate/)
### Green New Deal
- The Green new Deal is a proposed package of United States legislation that aims to address climate change and economic inequality.
- Trump in 2019 speaking to employees of Sempra Energy, he said `That’s a hoax...Under that deal, everybody in this room gets fired.` [link](https://boingboing.net/2019/05/14/trump-says-green-new-deal-is.html) Trump has tweeted ` I think it is very important for the Democrats to press forward with their Green New Deal. It would be great for the so-called "Carbon Footprint" to permanently eliminate all Planes, Cars, Cows, Oil, Gas & the Military – even if no other country would do the same. Brilliant!` [link](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1094375749279248385)
- The Green New Deal is no hoax. Instead, the resolution is one of the few calls to climate action that rises to the scale of the crisis. [link](https://www.nrdc.org/experts/aliya-haq/green-new-deal-rises-scale-climate-challenge) Despite Trump’s scare tactics, it makes no mention of outlawing hamburgers or flying—and experts agree it wouldn’t cause mass layoffs. `How Many Jobs Will The Green New Deal Kill And Create? Every economist I talked to agreed: The Green New Deal would be a job creator. Most said it's impossible to know exactly how many jobs it will add to the economy, but studies generally show that government investments in green technology boost employment possibilities.` [link](https://psmag.com/economics/will-the-green-new-deal-work-heres-what-the-research-says)
- The University of Massachusetts­–Amherst calculated what would be needed to cut the U.S.'s carbon emissions by 40 percent in 20 years. The study found that the American government and private companies would have to invest a collective $200 billion a year, the government should collect about $200 billion a year in carbon taxes, about 1.5 million jobs would be destroyed, and 4.2 million new jobs would be created.

- Carolyn Heinrich, a public policy professor at Vanderbilt University. Often, with worker retraining, she says, "what we're not able to do is get to them where they were before." People might have to start over in a new industry, at a lower level than they're used to. Or, if a disappeared industry affects their entire region, they may have to move (but then, how to sell a house in a region where jobs have been gutted?). "So it looks like a negative impact, right?" Heinrich says. "Compared to people who just go out and start working." [link](https://psmag.com/economics/will-the-green-new-deal-work-heres-what-the-research-says) [link](https://peabody.vanderbilt.edu/bio/carolyn-heinrich)
- Biden supports the Green New deal. Biden’s plan will: `Ensure the U.S. achieves a 100% clean energy economy and reaches net-zero emissions no later than 2050. On day one, Biden will sign a series of new executive orders with unprecedented reach that go well beyond the Obama-Biden Administration platform and put us on the right track. And, he will demand that Congress enacts legislation in the first year of his presidency that: 1) establishes an enforcement mechanism that includes milestone targets no later than the end of his first term in 2025, 2) makes a historic investment in clean energy and climate research and innovation, 3) incentivizes the rapid deployment of clean energy innovations across the economy, especially in communities most impacted by climate change.` [link](https://joebiden.com/climate/)
- `Build a stronger, more resilient nation. On day one, Biden will make smart infrastructure investments to rebuild the nation and to ensure that our buildings, water, transportation, and energy infrastructure can withstand the impacts of climate change. Every dollar spent toward rebuilding our roads, bridges, buildings, the electric grid, and our water infrastructure will be used to prevent, reduce, and withstand a changing climate. As President, Biden will use the convening power of government to boost climate resilience efforts by developing regional climate resilience plans, in partnership with local universities and national labs, for local access to the most relevant science, data, information, tools, and training.` [link](https://joebiden.com/climate/)
- `Rally the rest of the world to meet the threat of climate change. Climate change is a global challenge that requires decisive action from every country around the world. Joe Biden knows how to stand with America’s allies, stand up to adversaries, and level with any world leader about what must be done. He will not only recommit the United States to the Paris Agreement on climate change – he will go much further than that. He will lead an effort to get every major country to ramp up the ambition of their domestic climate targets. He will make sure those commitments are transparent and enforceable, and stop countries from cheating by using America’s economic leverage and power of example. He will fully integrate climate change into our foreign policy and national security strategies, as well as our approach to trade.` [link](https://joebiden.com/climate/)
### Trump And The Removal Of EPA Regulations
- Trump has been documented by National Geographic for many anti climate change policy. Many of the actions roll back Obama-era policies that aimed to curb climate change and limit environmental pollution, while others threaten to limit federal funding for science and the environment.
- On March 13, 2017, The White House released its first preliminary budget under President Trump. [link](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/budget/fy2018/2018_blueprint.pdf) Confirming weeks of speculation, the budget outlines deep cuts to U.S. science and environmental agencies—notably EPA and NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration—and a vast array of social programs, in an effort to increase defense spending by $54 billion. Congressional and public opposition to the budget crystallizes almost immediately. [link](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/03/trump-cuts-epa-noaa-environmental-science-climate-change-impacts/)
- See National Geographic article of Trump’s list of Environmental Policy - [link](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2017/03/how-trump-is-changing-science-environment/)
### Trump And Coal
- Trump has been promoting coal, which has been a dying industry due to cheaper natural gas and fracking. Coal jobs have decreased in number and coal stocks have fallen substantially since he took office. [link](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/10/30/trump-save-coal-country-murray-bankruptcy-gas/)
- Analysis of a number of studies from around the world on the feasibility of 100% renewables. In brief, the study includes explanations that: There’s more than enough solar, wind and hydro potential – 30 times more than business-as-usual forecasts for energy demand in 2050. Technology already exists to account for the variability of wind and solar generation, so that the lights will stay on even when the weather doesn’t cooperate. We do not need to alter the design of the electric grid radically to accommodate 100 percent renewables: The shift is well underway and accelerating. Costs won’t be overwhelming. A grid based on 100 percent renewables can compete in cost with fossil fuel systems, even before factoring in the tremendous costs of pollution, global warming and water usage. A number of nations and regions are at or close to 100 percent renewables already, including Denmark, Norway and parts of Germany. Canada is at 62 percent renewables and Brazil at 76 percent.

## Foreign Policy
### North Korea Denuclearisation Attempts
- Trump and Kim Jong-un signed a Joint Statement which reaffirmed the Panmunjom Declaration. A result of that agreement, Kim Jong-un agreed to speed up the denuclearization process on the Korean Peninsula by building a new relationship between the United States and North Korea, signing a Joint Statement on June 12, 2018.
- Reuters revealed that on the second day of the North Korea–United States Summit in Hanoi, U.S. president passed DPRK Kim a note that bluntly called for North Korea to surrender all its nuclear weapons and fuel, a proposal the North Koreans had repeatedly rejected. [[withapieceofpapertrumpcal]]
- According to Jenny Town, Washington based, think-tank and North Korean expert, `it's Bolton's proposal in 2004, has been rejected more than once and, to bring it up again… would rather be insulting.` She also said that the US should have learned that this wasn't effective diplomacy, and shows they haven't learned how to properly negotiate. [link](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-usa-document-exclusive/exclusive-with-a-piece-of-paper-trump-called-on-kim-to-hand-over-nuclear-weapons-idUSKCN1RA2NR)
- On September 10, Trump sacked the national security adviser John Bolton as he strongly disagreed with John Bolton's suggestion, [link](https://www.news.com.au/finance/work/leaders/sacked-national-security-adviser-john-boltons-legacy-of-turmoil/news-story/7d35044f50c60f1cbefd4e9282f44044) However, Bolton himself claims he was not sacked but resigned. [link](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/11/podcasts/the-daily/john-bolton-is-fired-or-did-he-resign.html?showTranscript=1)
- China’s ambassador to the U.N. announced that the current standoff was a failure to counter `positive steps` taken by North Korea toward denuclearisation. A close U.S. ally, South Korea has also supported the official proposal of easing some sanctions to DPRK, and requested for diplomatic efforts to be focused on resuming nuclear talks. [link](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-usa-un-china-analysis/u-s-led-pressure-fractures-as-china-russia-push-for-north-korea-sanctions-relief-idUSKBN1YL0OX)
- In 2020, Trump tells his advisers he doesn't want another summit with North Korea's leader Kim before the U.S. presidential election this year. It's understood that Trump might be focused on his re-election campaign; his desire to engage on the nuclear issue has waned. Although Trump’s disinterest, the top foreign policy advisers are still trying to build a bridge of the nuclear deal between two leaders. [link](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-51074956)
### Syrian Missile Strike
- On the morning of 7 April 2017, the United States launched 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles from the Mediterranean Sea into Syria, aimed at Shayrat Airbase controlled by the Syrian government. [link](https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Releases/Release/Article/1144598/statement-from-pentagon-spokesman-capt-jeff-davis-on-us-strike-in-syria/) The strike was executed under responsibility of U.S. Trump, as a direct response to the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack that occurred on 4 April. [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20170407021906/http://edition.cnn.com/2017/04/06/politics/donald-trump-syria-military/index.html)
- Commentators attributed the ability of the Syrian government to continue to operate from the base to the fact that the US gave Russia, Syria's ally, an advanced warning regarding the strike, which enabled Syrians to shelter many of its aircraft from the attack. [link](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/04/08/syrian-warplanes-take-air-base-bombed-us-tomahawks/)
- Within a day of the attack, Russia announced it would strengthen Syria's air defenses and formally notified the Pentagon that as of 21:00 GMT (00:00 Moscow Time, 8 April 2017). [[MKULTRA]] Russia had suspended the U.S.–Russia Memorandum of Mutual Understanding, which had established a hotline between the countries′ militaries designed to avoid collisions between their aircraft over Syria. [link](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-04-07/syria-strikes-why-did-donald-trump-target-that-airbase/8425658)
- As a result, Belgium suspended its air operations in Syria, [link](http://aranews.net/2017/04/belgium-suspends-air-operations-syria-us-strike/) and the US began limiting itself to only the most essential air strikes. [link](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/08/us/politics/us-islamic-state-syria.html)
- On 11 April 2017, after the meeting at Lucca in Italy the G7 unanimously blamed the Syrian government's military for the chemical attack and agreed that Assad must step down as part of any peace solution, but European allies rejected the US and UK push for sanctions against Russia and Syria. [[sanctionsrussiasyriag7chemicalweaponsdonaldtrumpuku]]
- On 19 April 2017, two US defense officials said that the Syrian government had relocated the majority of its combat planes to Khmeimim Airbase shortly after the strike. [link](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/04/19/politics/syria-warplanes-russia-base/)
- Trump vastly increased civilian death from conventional airstrikes in Iraq and Syria: [link](https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2018/05/how-many-civilians-did-trump-kill-in-drone-strikes-last-year/)
### ‘Muslim’ Travel Ban
- Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, citing security concerns. The signing of the order provoked widespread condemnation and protests and resulted in legal intervention against the enforcement of the order with some calling it a `Muslim ban` because Trump had previously called for temporarily banning Muslims from entering America soon after the 2015 San Bernardino terrorist attack, and because all of the affected countries had a Muslim majority. [link](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-41382585)
- Trump stated he picked up on these fears, speaking frequently of Christians who were refused entry to the United States and beheaded by terrorists of the Islamic State: `If you’re a Christian, you have no chance,` he said in Ohio in November. [[christianleadersdenouncetrum]]
- Trump's stated reason for issuing the executive order was to prevent terrorism. An internal report compiled by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Intelligence and Analysis Unit, however, concluded that people from the seven nations affected by the travel ban pose no increased terror risk. The report found that `country of citizenship is unlikely to be a reliable indicator of potential terrorist activity` and that few individuals from the seven affected countries access the U.S. in any case, since the State Department grants a small number of visas to citizens of those countries.` The report found that of 82 people determined to have inspired by a foreign terrorist organization `to carry out or try to carry out an attack in the United States, just over half were U.S. citizens born in the United States,` while the rest came from a group of 26 countries, only two of which were among the seven nations included in the ban [link](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/25/us/politics/travel-ban-nations-terror-risk.html) [link](http://bigstory.ap.org/article/39f1f8e4ceed4a30a4570f693291c866/dhs-intel-report-disputes-threat-posed-travel-ban-nations)
- Biden Is in support of `Rescind the un-American travel and refugee bans, also referred to as “Muslim bans.” The Trump Administration’s anti-Muslim bias hurts our economy, betrays our values, and can serve as a powerful terrorist recruiting tool. Prohibiting Muslims from entering the country is morally wrong, and there is no intelligence or evidence that suggests it makes our nation more secure. It is yet another abuse of power by the Trump Administration designed to target primarily black and brown immigrants. Biden will immediately rescind the “Muslim bans.”` [link](https://joebiden.com/immigration/)
### Iran Deal
- The United States announced its withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), also known as the `Iran nuclear deal` or the `Iran deal`, on May 8, 2018. [link](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/world/middleeast/trump-iran-nuclear-deal.html) The withdrawal caused concerns in Iran due to its impact on the economy. [link](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/world/middleeast/iran-crisis-nuclear-deal.html) Trump announced the withdrawal during a speech at the White House on May 8, 2018, saying, `the heart of the Iran deal was a giant fiction: that a murderous regime desired only a peaceful nuclear energy program.` [link](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/us/politics/trump-speech-iran-deal.html)
- Vox covered the Iran deal in 9 graphics. Every aspect of the deal that wanted to limit Iran in its nuclear supplies successfully carried out its requirements. `The nuclear deal prohibits Iran from possessing any uranium that’s more than 3.67 percent U-235, and prohibits it from having more than 660 pounds of enriched uranium (about 97 percent less than it had prior to the deal). Iran is fully complying with these restrictions.`,`Prior to the deal, Iran had close to 20,000 centrifuges at its uranium enrichment facilities, Natanz and Fordow. Under the deal’s terms, Iran can only enrich at Natanz, and can only operate a maximum of 5,060 older-model centrifuges (rather than newer, more efficient ones). Iran is fully complying with these restrictions.`,`Iran has such a reactor in Arak; the deal requires Iran not to operate the facility and to redesign it such that it will not produce fissile material if operated. Iran is fully complying with these restrictions.` [link](https://www.vox.com/world/2018/5/8/17328858/iran-nuclear-deal-trump-announcement-chart)
- Biden spoke in Manhattan on these tensions with Iran — and called on Trump to rejoin the Iran deal amid increasing tensions over the killing of Major General Qassim Suleimani. “The seeds of danger were planted by Donald Trump himself on May 8, 2019 — the day he tore up the Iran Nuclear Deal, against the advice of his own top master security adviser,” said Biden during his speech. “He turned his back on our closest European allies and decided that it was important to destroy any progress that the Obama-Biden administration did.” [link](https://www.amny.com/manhattan/in-manhattan-biden-urges-trump-to-restore-iran-deal-and-diffuse-tension/)
### Soleimani Airport airstrike
- On 3 January 2020, a United States drone strike near Baghdad International Airport targeted and killed Iranian major general Qasem Soleimani of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Adil Abdul-Mahdi, Prime Minister of Iraq, said he was scheduled to meet Soleimani on the day the attack happened, with the purpose of Soleimani's trip being that Soleimani was delivering Iran's response to a previous message from Saudi Arabia which Iraq had relayed. [link](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20200106-pm-irans-soleimani-was-in-iraq-to-discuss-relations-with-saudi/) According to Abdul-Mahdi, Trump had called him to request that Abdul-Mahdi mediate the conflict between the U.S. and Iran before the drone strike. [[iraqisvoteto]]
- According to an unnamed senior U.S. official, after the bombing of Kata'ib Hezbollah in late December 2019, a security briefing was convened at President Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate where he and his advisors, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Defense Secretary Mark Esper, and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff General Mark Milley discussed how to respond to Iran's alleged role in sponsoring anti-U.S. attacks in Iraq. Reportedly, the targeted killing of Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, whom U.S. officials regarded as a facilitator of attacks on U.S. personnel in Iraq, was listed as the `most extreme option` [link](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/04/us/politics/trump-suleimani.html)
- On the same day of the Baghdad airport attack, an IRGC financier and key commander, Abdul Reza Shahlai, was unsuccessfully targeted by U.S. drones in Yemen, which killed Mohammad Mirza, a Quds Force operative, instead. [link](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/on-the-day-us-forces-killed-soleimani-they-launched-another-secret-operation-targeting-a-senior-iranian-official-in-yemen/2020/01/10/60f86dbc-3245-11ea-898f-eb846b7e9feb_story.html) [link](https://theintercept.com/2020/01/10/us-strike-abdul-reza-shahlai-yemen/)
- Biden accused Trump of “flat-out” lying about the justification for killing Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, an action that brought the U.S. and Iran to the brink of war. `Quite frankly, I think he’s flat-out lied about saying, the reason he made the strike [on Soleimani] was because our embassies were about to be bombed.` [link](https://thehill.com/policy/international/478311-biden-slams-trump-on-solemaini-strike-he-flat-out-lied)
- See `The Iran Cables` for more info on Iran - [link](https://theintercept.com/series/iran-cables/)
### Trump Drone Strikes
- According to an analysis from Micah Zenko, an analyst with the Council on Foreign Relations, Trump has markedly increased U.S. drone strikes since taking office. Zenko, who reported earlier this year on the over 26,000 bombs Obama dropped in 2016, summarized the increase: “During President Obama’s two terms in office, he approved 542 such targeted strikes in 2,920 days—one every 5.4 days. From his inauguration through today, Trump had approved at least 36 drone strikes or raids in 45 days—one every 1.25 days. [link](https://worldbeyondwar.org/u-s-drone-strikes-gone-432-since-trump-took-office/)
- Trump revoked an Obama-era policy requiring US intelligence officials report civilian drone strike deaths outside of war zones. [link](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47480207) These strikes are highly inefficient. In Yemen, for example, a third of the deaths are civilians, not terrorists [link](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2018/11/14/hidden-toll-of-us-drone-strikes-in-yemen-nearly-a-third-of-deaths-are-civilians-not-al-qaida/) “U.S. Air Forces Central Command data shows that coalition aircraft (excluding the Afghan Air Force) dropped 7,423 weapons in 2019, slightly higher than the 7,362 dropped in 2018” [link](https://www.statista.com/chart/16079/weapons-released-by-the-us-coalition-over-afghanistan/) “That increase can primarily be attributed to a change in the rules of engagement which allows coalition forces to open fire on the enemy without having to be in close contact with them. The change was orchestrated by former Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis who wanted to remove such restrictions in order to use air power to its full potential and defeat the enemy. The change, combined with more air strikes by the Afghan Air Force, has also led to a spike in civilian deaths. Last summer, the United Nations announced that Afghan and U.S. forces killed more civilians in the first half of 2019 than insurgents.” [link](https://www.statista.com/chart/16079/weapons-released-by-the-us-coalition-over-afghanistan/)
- On 16 March 2017 Trump submitted his request to Congress for $639 billion in military spending—$54 billion—which represents a 10 percent increase—for FY 2018 as well as $30 billion for FY2017 which ends in September. With a total federal budget of $3.9 trillion for FY2018, the increase in military spending would result in deep cuts to many other federal agencies and domestic programs, as well as the State Department. [link]
### Trump and Saudi Arabia
- On May 20, 2017, Trump sealed a weapons deal with Saudi Arabia worth $350 billion over 10 years, $110 billion of which will take effect immediately [[ussaudiarabiasealweaponsdealworthne]] During 2018, Trump made several assertions of how many American jobs the deal would create, including as many as 1,000,000. [link](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/10/22/trumps-claim-jobs-saudi-deals-grows-by-leaps-bounds/) The Washington Post Wrote `We’ve learned over time that the president does not pay much attention to details. So while he keeps increasing the number of jobs that he says would result from this deal, he might be surprised to learn what the official White House statement said when the deal was signed: “This package demonstrates the United States’ commitment to our partnership with Saudi Arabia, while also expanding opportunities for American companies in the region, potentially supporting tens of thousands of new jobs in the United States.” “Tens of thousands” is much, much lower than 600,000. Even that might be a stretch, though note that the statement uses the phrase “potentially supporting,” rather than “creating,” jobs. That means the White House could have been counting not just new factory workers but also secondary jobs resulting from the “feedback” of employed defense workers. (In theory, each dollar spent by a newly employed person reverberates through the economy, creating jobs for dentists, librarians, bread bakers, farmers, bartenders and so forth.)` [link](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/10/22/trumps-claim-jobs-saudi-deals-grows-by-leaps-bounds/)
- According to a confidential 2017 document of all of the military sales agreements reviewed by The Fact Checker, most of the items on Trump’s $110 billion list did not have delivery dates or were scheduled for 2022 or beyond. There appeared to be few, if any, signed contracts. Rather, many of the announcements were MOIs — memorandums of intent. There were six specific items, adding up to $28 billion, but all had been previously notified to Congress by the Obama administration. [link](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/10/11/trumps-billion-arms-sales-saudi-arabia-still-fake/)
- Trump vetoed a bipartisan bill that would have ended American involvement in the Yemeni Civil War. `Trump vetoed a bipartisan resolution on Tuesday that would have forced an end to American military involvement in Saudi Arabia’s civil war in Yemen, rejecting an appeal by lawmakers to his own deeply rooted instincts to withdraw the United States from bloody foreign conflicts.` [link](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/16/us/politics/trump-veto-yemen.html)
- Arms flow to Saudi Arabia have fueled genocide and illegal attacks in Yemen. In the aftermath of a Sept. 14 drone attack on a Saudi oil processing plant, Trump emphasized the financial benefit of the U.S.’s relationship with the kingdom. `They’ve been a great ally,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “They spend $400 billion in our country over the last number of years. Four hundred billion dollars. That’s a million and a half jobs. And they’re not ones that, unlike some countries, where they want terms; they want terms and conditions. They want to say, ‘Can we borrow the money at zero percent for the next 400 years?’ No. No. Saudi Arabia pays cash.` [link](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/u-s-weapon-saudi-airstrikes-yemen/) A team of investigators appointed by the U.N. Human Rights Council found that the airstrike fueled by the US-Saudi Arms Deal violated international humanitarian law and details numerous similar incidents in Yemen that may amount to war crimes.

## Coronavirus Policy
### Unheeded Warnings
- NY Times wrote an article on the many warnings given to Trump. `Government exercises, including one last year, made clear that the U.S. was not ready for a pandemic like the coronavirus. But little was done.` `imagining an influenza pandemic, was simulated by the Trump administration’s Department of Health and Human Services in a series of exercises that ran from last January to August.` (that simulation is linked in the article) [link](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-outbreak.html)
- Seven days before Trump took charge, Trump’s administration was briefed by the outgoing Obama administration on how to respond to pandemics by using simulated scenarios. This being about a strain of influenza known as H9N2 and that health systems were crashing in Asia, overwhelmed by the demand. `Health officials warn that this could become the worst influenza pandemic since 1918,` Trump’s aides were told. But roughly two-thirds of the Trump representatives in that room are no longer serving in the Trump administration. [link](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/16/trump-inauguration-warning-scenario-pandemic-132797)
- National Geographic reported that as of March 3, 2020, the `U.S. has only a fraction of the medical supplies it needs to combat coronavirus.` An additional 300 million N95 respirators and surgical masks could be required to protect health workers. However, in Senate testimony, U.S. HHS Secretary Alex Azar said `the Strategic National Stockpile has just 30 million surgical masks and 12 million respirators in reserve.` [link](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/03/us-america-has-fraction-medical-supplies-it-needs-to-combat-coronavirus/?)
- Dr. Rick Bright, a former Department of Health and Human Services official, on May 5 was alleging that the Trump administration pressured him to award contracts on the basis of politics and disregarding scientific opinion. `I was pressured to let politics and cronyism drive decisions over the opinions of the best scientists we have in government,` Bright said on a call with reporters after filing his complaint. In a lengthy series of exhibits that was included with Bright's whistleblower complaint, some of the memos are provided, including warnings on shortages of masks and syringes to administer an eventual vaccine. [link](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/05/05/politics/rick-bright-complaint/index.html)
### Delayed Response
- NY Times wrote another article on the attempts Trump has made to play down the coronavirus. `President Trump made his first public comments about the coronavirus on Jan. 22, in a television interview from Davos with CNBC’s Joe Kernen. The first American case had been announced the day before, and Kernen asked Trump, `Are there worries about a pandemic at this point?` The president responded: `No. Not at all. And we have it totally under control. It’s one person coming in from China, and we have it under control. It’s going to be just fine.` ` [link](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/opinion/trump-coronavirus.html)
- In February 2020, when there were only a dozen cases in the U.S., and before anyone had died, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advised Americans to prepare for an epidemic to contain the virus before it spreads throughout the U.S. Nancy Messonnier, a director at the CDC, explained that with no vaccine or treatment available, Americans must be prepared to take other precautions [link](https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-epidemic-how-to-prepare.html)
- Trump’s fiscal year 2021 budget proposal does propose a funding cut to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) `Funding summary (in millions of dollars) 2020 Enacted - 1240, 2021 - Request 813, 2021 Change from 2020 -427` [link](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/msar_fy21.pdf)
### Trump’s Attempt to Downplay the Coronavirus Pandemic
- Trump also claimed that the death rate published by the WHO was false, that the correct fatality rate was less than 1 percent, and said, `Well, I think the 3.4 percent is really a false number.` [link](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/just-my-hunch-trump-contradicts-health-experts-coronavirus-n1151006)
- Jan. 22: On whether he was worried about a pandemic: `No, we’re not at all. And we have it totally under control. It’s one person coming in from China.`
- Jan. 29: `Just received a briefing on the Coronavirus in China from all of our GREAT agencies, who are also working closely with China. We will continue to monitor the ongoing developments. We have the best experts anywhere in the world, and they are on top of it 24/7!`
- Feb. 7: `Nothing is easy, but [Chinese President Xi Jinping] … will be successful, especially as the weather starts to warm & the virus hopefully becomes weaker, and then gone.`
- Feb. 26: Q: This is spreading — or is going to spread, maybe, within communities. That’s the expectation. A: It may. It may. Q: Does that worry you? A: No. ... No, because we’re ready for it. It is what it is. We’re ready for it. We’re really prepared. ... We hope it doesn’t spread. There’s a chance that it won’t spread too, and there’s a chance that it will, and then it’s a question of at what level.
- Feb. 28: `It’s going to disappear. One day, it’s like a miracle, it will disappear.`
- Feb. 29: `We’re the number one travel destination anywhere in the world, yet we have far fewer cases of the disease than even countries with much less travel or a much smaller population.`
- March 6, Trump over-promised on the availability of COVID-19 testing in the United States, claiming that: `Anybody that wants a test can get a test.` Firstly, there were criteria needed to qualify for a test; recommendations were needed from doctors or health officials to approve testing. Secondly, the lack of test supplies resulted in some being denied tests even though doctors wanted to test them.

### N95 Masks
- Trump stated on April 6, 2020 in a White House briefing The Obama administration left Trump with a `stockpile with a cupboard that was bare.` The director of the national stockpile described it as an $8 billion enterprise in November. While the stockpile had a lot of goods, it didn’t have all the needed supplies for the nationwide 2020 pandemic. Reports show that N95 masks were depleted as a result of H1N1 in 2009, and experts warned they should be replenished. Budget figures going back to 2009 show overall funding for the stockpile dropped to its lowest in 2013, to about $477 million. Allocations have grown steadily since then to a 2020 budget of $705 million. [link](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/apr/08/donald-trump/trump-said-obama-admin-left-him-bare-stockpile-wro/)

### Coronavirus Being Called ‘China’ Virus
- Trump has been quoted over 20 times in various Press Conferences, Interviews and Tweets. [link](https://factba.se/search\#Chinese%2Bvirus) His deliberateness of the wording was made clear when a photographer captured the script of his speech wherein Trump had crossed out the word `Corona` and replaced it with `Chinese.` [link](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/03/20/coronavirus-trump-chinese-virus/) When faced with accusations of racism, he dismissed its impact on Asian Americans, saying: `It’s not racist at all. No, it’s not at all. It’s from China. That’s why. It comes from China. I want to be accurate.` [link](https://youtu.be/JgDcS-ZBH0k?t=1417) [link](https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-press-conference-coronavirus-briefing-march-18-2020)
- By early March, racist acts and harassment against Asians had already surged and they continued to spike through March and into April. [link](https://time.com/5797836/coronavirus-racism-stereotypes-attacks/) [link](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/asian-americans-report-nearly-500-racist-acts-over-last-week-n1169821) [link](https://bedfordandbowery.com/2020/03/chinese-businesses-victimized-by-crime-believe-coronavirus-is-to-blame/) [link](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/us/chinese-coronavirus-racist-attacks.html) [link](https://www.npr.org/2020/03/25/821591155/the-coronavirus-crisis-is-sparking-harassment-of-asian-americans) Trump’s own Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued a warning that white supremacists may exploit the crisis against Asian-Americans. [link](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/homeland-security-warns-terrorists-exploit-covid-19-pandemic/story?id=69770582) While Trump did not commit these terrible acts, elected officials and scientists have a responsibility for the way they talk about the virus – words matter. That is why the WHO has had a strict guideline since 2015 regarding the naming of diseases, a guideline followed by other world leaders. [link](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/163636/WHO_HSE_FOS_15.1_eng.pdf)
- The expressions `Chinese virus` and `Wuhan virus` personify the threat. Personification is metaphorical: its purpose is to help understand something unfamiliar and abstract (i.e. the virus) by using terms that are familiar and embodied (i.e. a location, a nationality or a person). But as cognitive linguists George Lakoff and Mark Johnson have long shown, metaphors are not just poetic tools, they are used constantly and shape our world view. [link](https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/M/bo3637992.html) The adjective `Chinese` is particularly problematic as it associates the infection with an ethnicity. Talking about group identities with an explicitly medical language [link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2690128/) is a recognized process of Othering, [link](https://tidsskrift.dk/qual/article/view/5510) [link](https://books.google.fr/books?hl=en&lr=&id=aB6pAgAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PT306&dq=othering+identity+) historically used in anti-immigrant rhetoric and policy, including toward Chinese immigrants in North America. This type of language stokes anxiety, resentment, fear and disgust toward people associated with that group. [link](https://theconversation.com/donald-trumps-chinese-virus-the-politics-of-naming-136796)
- Trump in those multiple tweets has been seen using the phrase and has defended [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zatCqqRY_I) and said he’ll stop using the term, `I don’t regret it, but they accused us of having done it through our soldiers, they said our soldiers did it on purpose, what kind of a thing is that?` Trump said in an interview Tuesday with Fox News. `Look, everyone knows it came out of China, but I decided we shouldn’t make any more of a big deal out of it. I think I made a big deal. I think people understand it. But that all began when they said our soldiers started it. Our soldiers had nothing to do with it.` [link](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-25/trump-says-he-ll-stop-using-chinese-virus-easing-blame-game) Sars-Cov-2 is the appropriate name for the new coronavirus recognised by medical professionals in Lancet.

### Hydroxychloroquine solution
- On March 19, Trump falsely claimed that the drug chloroquine was approved by the Food and Drug Administration as a treatment for COVID-19. This led the FDA to state that it had not approved any drugs or therapies for COVID-19. While Trump claimed that `we're going to be able to make that drug available almost immediately`, the leader of the FDA stated that the drug would still need to be tested in a `large, pragmatic clinical trial` on subjects infected with COVID-19. [link](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/19/politics/fact-check-chloroquine-trump-fda/index.html)
- Trump promoted the drugs chloroquine (also known as chloroquine phosphate)[400] and hydroxychloroquine as potential treatments `by prescription` for COVID-19 on March 19. He noted the drugs showed `tremendous promise` and said he was working together with Governor Cuomo to begin quickly studying and treating coronavirus patients with the drugs in New York. He also remarked on their long-term usage as medicines in the United States saying, `the nice part is, it's been around for a long time, so we know that if it—if things don't go as planned, it's not going to kill anybody.` [link](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/trump-is-overhyping-unproven-coronavirus-drugs/2020/03/19/ed1ff4e2-6a1a-11ea-b199-3a9799c54512_story.html) [link](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-6/)
- On March 21, Trump tweeted `HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE & AZITHROMYCIN, taken together, have a real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine. The FDA has moved mountains - Thank You! Hopefully they will BOTH (H works better with A, International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents) be put in use IMMEDIATELY. PEOPLE ARE DYING, MOVE FAST, and GOD BLESS EVERYONE! @US_FDA @SteveFDA @CDCgov @DHSgov` [link](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1241367239900778501?lang=en)
- Both hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine were already being used to treat coronavirus patients by a number of physicians under the limited compassionate use approval of the FDA or as an off-label prescription, while trials and analysis are still ongoing. [link](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-expected-to-detail-new-virus-therapies-but-expansion-could-be-controversial-11584629965?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=10)
- During a coronavirus press conference, after Trump making one of his many promotions of Hydroxychloroquine, Dr Fauci says, `You really can’t make any definitive statement about it,` Moments earlier, Fauci was asked whether there was any evidence that one such drug— hydroxychloroquine — might be used as an effective prophylactic measure against coronavirus. `The answer is no,` Fauci replied. [link](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-rips-reporter-who-asked-him-calm-scared-americans-terrible-n1165031)
- `We found no evidence that use of HQC, either with or without AZ, reduced the risk of mechanical ventilation in patients hospitalized with Covid-19. An association of increased overall mortality was identified in patients treated with HQC alone.` [link](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.16.20065920v2)
- On April 21, the results of a study were released in which treatment with hydroxychloroquine was linked to higher rates of death than those in a control group who did not receive any drug treatment. [link](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/04/21/anti-malarial-drug-trump-touted-is-linked-higher-rates-death-va-coronavirus-patients-study-says/)
### Disinfectant and Light solution
- During the April 23 briefing, DHS Science and Technology Directorate William N. Bryan presented preliminary findings from lab experiments conducted by the Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, which found that COVID-19's half-life in saliva droplets on a non-porous surface was shorter when exposed to heightened heat or humidity, and considerably shortened in ultraviolet light (such as direct sunlight). Bryan noted that this evidence could help `support practical decision-making` (such as having governments encourage more outdoor activity by residents), but that `it would be irresponsible for us to say summer will kill the virus`.
- On April 24, Trump made a comment in that day's daily Corona Press conference to one of his advisors, Dr. Deborah Birx, on both light or UV light from inside and outside the body as well as injecting disinfectant. [link](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/it-s-irresponsible-it-s-dangerous-experts-rip-trump-s-n1191246)
- On April 25, Trump then said these comments in response to a question regarding said comments were ‘Sarcastic’ because ‘of reporters like you’ [link](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/warnings-trump-suggesting-disinfectant-ingestion-deadly-wh-claims/story?id=70328631) Trump then later tweeted that he wasn’t speaking to Dr. Deborah Birx `Wrong, I was speaking to our Laboratory expert, not Deborah, about sunlight etc. & the CoronaVirus.` [link](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1254145835450933249) this is absolutely false as the tape shows him asking questions directly to Dr. Deborah Birx. [link](https://youtu.be/Cpcxbq_Anuc) Trump then went on to say that disinfectant `would kill [the virus] on the hands, and that would make things much better.` [link](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/warnings-trump-suggesting-disinfectant-ingestion-deadly-wh-claims/story?id=70328631) However, applying disinfectants on skin has the potential to cause irritation or chemical burns. [link](https://www.vox.com/2020/4/24/21234730/trump-sarcastic-disinfectant-injections-coronavirus)
- Trump’s suggestion involving the injection of disinfectants faced strong criticism from health experts, who stated that doing so would be dangerous and lethal. Reckitt Benckiser, the manufacturer of Lysol, issued a warning against use of its products internally. [link](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/it-s-irresponsible-it-s-dangerous-experts-rip-trump-s-n1191246)
- Since he made these comments, axios received news from trusted sources that Trump has been urged to reduce the length and frequency of coronavirus press conferences. [[trumpdailycoronavirusbriefings]]
### `Released From Wuhan Laboratories` Conspiracy
- Trump said that he has seen evidence linking the novel coronavirus to a lab in Wuhan, China, without providing further details. [link](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/495571-trump-says-he-has-seen-evidence-linking-coronavirus-to-wuhan-lab)
- In February, Republican Senator Tom Cotton speculated that the coronavirus outbreak might have come out of a Chinese lab in Wuhan. Also implied that China may have deliberately allowed the evidence to spread. WHO rejects this explicitly. [link](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2020/04/21/coronavirus-who-says-evidence-shows-covid-19-not-made-lab/2995236001/)
- Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease and perhaps the single most prominent doctor in the world at the moment, In an interview with National Geographic posted on Monday night, [link](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/05/anthony-fauci-no-scientific-evidence-the-coronavirus-was-made-in-a-chinese-lab-cvd/\#close) Fauci was definitive about the origins of the virus which has sickened more than a million Americans and killed more than 68,000, `If you look at the evolution of the virus in bats and what's out there now, [the scientific evidence] is very, very strongly leaning toward this could not have been artificially or deliberately manipulated ... Everything about the stepwise evolution over time strongly indicates that [this virus] evolved in nature and then jumped species.` [link](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/05/05/politics/fauci-trump-coronavirus-wuhan-lab/index.html)
- There had also been claims that Coronavius originated and was transmitted from bats. This theory broke from Shi Zhengli, a 55-year-old scientist who had been looking to make a mark on bat-linked virology, an area to which she has dedicated her life. For years, Ms Shi has collected strains of coronaviruses from bats. In 2004, she identified a reservoir for such diseases in bat caves in Yunnan province in southern China and she has been at the forefront of research on how viruses such as Sars may have jumped to humans. Because of this, she has been dubbed the name, `batwoman`. [link](https://www.ft.com/content/255a3524-0459-4724-a92a-58268ab627e2)
- The U.S. intelligence community said it agreed with the scientific consensus that the virus was not `manmade or genetically modified` but confirmed that officials are investigating whether the outbreak began through contact with animals or as a result of a lab accident in Wuhan. [link](https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/495449-intelligence-agency-confirms-investigation-into-origins-of)
- Edward Holmes, an Australian virologist who helped map and share the genetic sequence of the virus, said there was no evidence that Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19 in humans, originated in a Wuhan laboratory. `if the adaptive process occurred in humans, then even if repeated zoonotic transfers occur, they are unlikely to take off without the same series of mutations` He said the closest known relative of Sars-Cov-2 was a bat virus named RaTG13, which was indeed kept at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. But he added the bat virus, which was sampled in Yunnan province, had a level of genome sequence divergence from coronavirus equivalent to at least 20-50 years of evolutionary change. Thus, he does not believe it was responsible for Covid-19. Prof Holmes, who in 2014 visited the Wuhan live animal market that Chinese authorities have said was the source of the disease, argues the most likely origin of the virus is that it jumped from wildlife to new hosts.

### Trump Withdrawing All U.S. Funding From The W.H.O. During Global Pandemic
- Trump announced on 14 April that he is halting $400 million to $500 million of funding to the World Health Organization while a review is conducted. Trump said, noting that China `contributes roughly $40 million.` that there was an imbalance of funding compared to China. Trump said the review would cover the WHO's `role in severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of coronavirus.` `Had the WHO done its job to get medical experts into China to objectively assess the situation on the ground and to call out China's lack of transparency, the outbreak could have been contained at its source with very little death,` Trump said. [link](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/14/politics/donald-trump-world-health-organization-funding-coronavirus/index.html)
### Trump’s Firing Rick A. Bright and `\#FireFauci` Retweet
- Rick A. Bright, commonly cited as the Top Infectious-Disease Expert in the U.S, was abruptly fired from his job because he insisted that the federal government rely on science when making scientific decisions. Bright said in a statement yesterday that he was fired, in particular, because he insisted that hydroxychloroquine, the anti-malaria drug Trump has repeatedly touted as a `miracle cure` for covid-19, be tested rigorously. [link](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/trumps-firing-of-a-top-infectious-disease-expert-endangers-us-all) Bright formally filed an extensive whistleblower complaint because of these circumstances. `I was pressured to let politics and cronyism drive decisions over the opinions of the best scientists we have in government,` Bright said on a call with reporters after filing his complaint. [link](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/05/05/politics/rick-bright-complaint/index.html)
- A spokesman for a key House panel said that the White House had blocked Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, from testifying at a hearing in congress on the coronavirus outbreak. House Appropriations Committee spokesman Evan Hollander said the panel sought Fauci — the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases — as a witness for a subcommittee hearing on the government’s response to the pandemic, but was denied. Hollander said the panel was informed by an administration official that Fauci’s testimony was blocked by the White House.Fauci has warned against relaxing social distancing rules that have helped slow the spread of the virus but caused a major hit to the economy. That has earned him criticism from some of Trump’s most ardent supporters, and the president has retweeted a supporter’s remark calling for Fauci’s firing. [link](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-05-01/white-house-blocking-fauci-testimony-panel-spokesman-says)
- Fauci conceded to CNN that earlier mitigation efforts could have saved more lives and again called for a cautious reopening of the nation, despite Trump’s calls to quickly restart the economy. `I mean, obviously, you could logically say that if you had a process that was ongoing and you started mitigation earlier, you could have saved lives,` Fauci, said on `State of the Union` when asked if social distancing and stay-at-home measures could have prevented deaths had they been put in place in February, instead of mid-March. `Obviously, no one is going to deny that. But what goes into those decisions is complicated,` added Fauci, who is a key member of the Trump administration's coronavirus task force. `But you're right, I mean, obviously, if we had right from the very beginning shut everything down, it may have been a little bit different. But there was a lot of pushback about shutting things down back then.` Trump then retweeted a user who said it was `Time to \#FireFauci` [link](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/13/politics/donald-trump-anthony-fauci-tweet/index.html)
### Pence Disbanding Coronavirus Task Force
- Pence told reporters on May 6, that the coronavirus task force created to manage the federal government’s response to the pandemic could be disbanded within a month because `of the tremendous progress we’ve made as a country.` [link](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/05/05/coronavirus-update-us/) Pence portrayed the task force as having accomplished its goal as the U.S. outbreak -- the largest in the world -- plateaus. There have been nearly 1.2 million cases of Covid-19 and more than 70,000 deaths from the disease, but states are beginning to try to reopen businesses and lift social-distancing regulations as the growth of the outbreak slows. On Sunday, Trump revised upward the number of the deaths he expects from the outbreak, saying the total could reach 100,000. In April he had said he thought between 50,000 and 60,000 Americans would die. [link](https://fortune.com/2020/05/05/coronavirus-task-force-white-house/)
### Trump Administration Ignoring The CDC On Reopening Us During Pandemic
- The Trump administration said they will not implement the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 17-page draft recommendation for reopening America, a senior CDC official confirmed on 7 May. `The 17-page report represents an ask from the White House Task Force to come up with these recommendations. That's our role. To put together this guidance.` A task force official told CNN that Trump’s guidelines announced in mid-April for reopening the country `made clear that each state should open up in a safe and responsible way based on the data and response efforts in those individual states.` An administration official told CNN that CDC leadership had not seen the draft document before it was leaked, and there were two concerns when it reached the task force. It was `overly prescriptive` because `guidance in rural Tennessee shouldn't be the same guidance for urban New York City,` and the recommendations in the document did not fit the `phases` that had already been outlined by the task force. `I want to go back to where it was, that's where we're going to be,` Trump said. [link](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/05/07/politics/cdc-guidance-coronavirus-reopen-america/index.html)
### Trump Not Being A ‘Civilian’ To Avoid Wearing A Mask
- The White House on the 24th June, [link](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-quarantine-new-jersey-civilian-white-house/) said that President Trump will not follow a New Jersey quarantine policy when he travels there this weekend because he is "not a civilian" and anyone who comes near him is tested to make sure they don't have COVID-19. refuted by 1950 court ruling, `In the Roosevelt case, the Dutchess County, N.Y. Surrogate’s Court ultimately determined that the former Commander-in-Chief’s estate was not entitled to tax benefits afforded to those who die as members of the military. That’s because the court held that Roosevelt was a civilian.` [link](https://lawandcrime.com/legal-analysis/law-order-president-wont-obey-njs-quarantine-rules-because-hes-not-a-civilian-he-is-a-civilian/)
### Trump Making American Lives Worse During a Global Pandemic
- In the midst of a global pandemic with the presidential election just months away, the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court on June 25th to invalidate the Affordable Care Act, the landmark health care law that enabled millions of Americans to get insurance coverage and that remains in effect despite the pending legal challenge. [[obamacar]]
- On 14 April 2020, Trump pledged to halt United States funding to the WHO while reviewing its role in `severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus.` [link](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/14/us/coronavirus-updates.html) The United States had paid half of its annual assessed fees to the WHO as of 31 March 2020; it would ordinarily pay its remaining fees in September 2020. [link](https://www.politifact.com/article/2020/apr/21/critics-say-trumps-who-funding-hold-violates-impou/) World leaders and health experts largely condemned President Trump’s announcement, which came amid criticism of his response to the outbreak in the United States. [link](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus/who-regrets-trump-funding-halt-as-global-coronavirus-cases-top-2-million-idUSKCN21X0AL) As of July 8th, Trump is beginning formal withdrawal from the World Health Organisation. [link](https://time.com/5847505/trump-withdrawl-who/)
- Trump has also stated `I disagree with @CDCgov on their very tough & expensive guidelines for opening schools. While they want them open, they are asking schools to do very impractical things. I will be meeting with them!!!` [link](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1280857657365200902)
### The Academic Response to Trump Pandemic Response
- The Lancet, one of the world’s leading medical journals, chastised Trump’s response to COVID-19 concluding it to be “inconsistent and incoherent”; they cite the following reasons: Trump recalling CDC staff from China in July of 2019, which hindered intelligence efforts with the advent of COVID-19; Trump questioning the quarantine guidelines recommended by the CDC; Trump’s sole focus on “magic bullet” solutions to COVID-19, such as vaccines and new medicines; Trump silencing/removing CDC directors; Trump defunding the World Health Organization. [link](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31140-5/fulltext)
- Usually, America takes the global role of dealing with pandemics, but Trump performed less than average as expected (NPR 2020). Trump defunded the WHO, as previously stated "The U.S. went into the coronavirus crisis with immense advantages: precious weeks of warning about what was coming, the world's best concentration of medical and scientific expertise, effectively limitless financial resources, a military complex with stunning logistical capacity," "Yet it managed to make itself the global epicentre of the pandemic." [link](https://www.npr.org/2020/04/30/848179346/pandemic-fuels-debate-trumps-america-first-or-u-s-global-leadership)
### Biden on Coronavirus
- Biden is in support of:
    
    - `Ensure that every person who needs a test can get one – and that testing for those who need it is free.` as he recognises `Individuals should also not have to pay anything out of their own pockets for the visit at which the test is ordered` [link](https://joebiden.com/covid19/)
    
    - `Establish at least ten mobile testing sites and drive-through facilities per state to speed testing and protect health care workers.` as he recognises `Starting in large cities and rapidly expanding beyond, the CDC must work with private labs and manufacturers to ensure adequate production capacity, quality control, training, and technical assistance`
    
    - `Expand CDC sentinel surveillance programs and other surveillance programs` as he recognises `vulnerable populations like nursing home patients and people with underlying medical conditions. This must be done in collaboration with private sector health care entities.`
    
    - `Preparing to stand up multi-hundred-bed temporary hospitals in any city on short notice by deploying existing Federal Medical Stations in the strategic national stockpile and preemptively defining potential locations for their use as needed.`
    
    - `Directing the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) to prepare for potential deployment of military resources, both the active and reserve components, and work with governors to prepare for potential deployment of National Guard resources, to provide medical facility capacity, logistical support, and additional medical personnel if necessary. This includes activating the Medical Reserve Corps, which consists of nearly 200,000 volunteer health care professionals who stand ready to serve across America; training and deploying additional surge capacity, including U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs/DOD medical equipment and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Disaster Assistance Medical Teams; and directing and assisting existing hospitals to surge care for 20% more patients than current capacity through flexible staffing, use of telemedicine support, and delaying elective procedures.`
    
    - `Instructing the CDC to establish real-time dashboards tracking (1) hospital admissions related to COVID-19, especially for ICUs and emergency departments, in concert with the American Hospital Association and large hospital chains, for which the HHS must ensure data is able to be shared, as needed; and (2) supply chain information – including availability, allocation, and shipping – for essential equipment and personal protective equipment, including in the various places where there may be federal reserves. The strategic national stockpile must be used to supplement any shortages that exist, especially for essential medical supplies, like oxygen, ventilators, and personal protective equipment.`
    
    - `Ensuring that training, materials, and resources reach federally qualified health centers, rural health clinics, and safety-net hospitals, which are typically resource-poor and care disproportionately for vulnerable populations that will bear the brunt of COVID-19. This effort will lay the foundation for a deeper and more lasting public health infrastructure for accessible national health care for all.`

### 2016 Election `Fraud` Conspiracy
- Trump has claimed without evidence that between 3 and 5 million people cost him the popular vote to Hillary Clinton by voting illegally. He argued that he narrowly lost to Hillary Clinton in 2016 in New Hampshire because thousands of people were illegally bused there from Massachusetts. [link](http://www.businessinsider.com/stephen-miller-voter-fraud-allegations-abc-2017-2)
- On May 11, 2017, Trump signed an executive order to establish a voter fraud commission to conduct an investigation into voter fraud. [link](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/11/trump-voter-fraud-commission-238263)
- On January 3, 2018, the Trump administration disbanded the commission. In the disbanding announcement, Trump blamed states for not handing over requested voter information to the commission, and still maintained that there was `substantial evidence of voter fraud`. [link](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/03/us/politics/trump-voter-fraud-commission.html)
- `In a letter to Vice President Mike Pence and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who are both Republicans and led the commission, Maine Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap said the documents show there was a “pre-ordained outcome” and that drafts of a commission report included a section on evidence of voter fraud that was “glaringly empty.”` [link](https://apnews.com/f5f6a73b2af546ee97816bb35e82c18d/Report:-Trump-commission-did-not-find-widespread-voter-fraud)
- Election integrity experts argued that the commission was disbanded because of the lawsuits, which would have led to greater transparency and accountability in the commission and thus prevented the Republican members of the commission from producing a sham report to justify restrictions on voting rights, [link](http://www.pressherald.com/2018/01/06/trump-administration-resists-turning-over-documents-to-dunlap/)
- The often cited 2012 Pew report, which Trump has incorrectly cited as proof of voter fraud, entitled `Inaccurate, Costly, and Inefficient Evidence That America's Voter Registration System Needs an Upgrade,` was based on data collected in 2008. The study investigated `outdated voter rolls, not fraudulent votes.` It did not make `mention of non-citizens voting or registering to vote`. [link](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/25/sean-spicer/sean-spicer-wrongly-uses-pew-study-bolster-claim-n/)
- Proponents of voter ID laws have pointed to a 2014 study by Old Dominion University professors Jesse Richman and David Earnest as justification. The study, which used data developed by the Cooperative Congressional Election Study, concluded that more than 14 percent of self-identified non-citizens in 2008 and 2010 indicated that they were registered to vote, approximately 6.4% of surveyed non-citizens voted in 2008, and 2.2% of surveyed non-citizens voted in 2010. [link](https://digitalcommons.odu.edu/politicalscience_geography_pubs/11)
- However, the study also concluded that voter ID requirements would be ineffective at reducing non-citizen voting. [[lafim]] This study has been criticized by numerous academics. [link](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2014/10/27/methodological-challenges-affect-study-of-non-citizens-voting/) [link](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/11/donald-trump-illegal-votes-evidence-debunked-214487)
- One of those was a 2015 study by the managers of the Cooperative Congressional Election Study found that the Richman and Earnest study was `almost certainly flawed` and that, in fact, it was most likely that 0% of non-citizens had voted in recent American elections. Richman and Earnest's findings were the result of measurement error; some individuals who answered the survey checked the wrong boxes in surveys. Richman and Earnest therefore extrapolated from a handful of wrongfully classified cases to achieve an exaggerated number of individuals who appeared to be non-citizen voters. [link](https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.electstud.2015.07.002)
- Richman later conceded that `the response error issues ... may have biased our numbers`. Richman has also rebuked Trump for claiming that millions voted illegally in 2016. [[illegal]]
- Brian Schaffner, Professor of Political Science at University of Massachusetts, Amherst, who was part of the team that debunked Richman and Earnest's study said that the study `... is not only wrong, it is irresponsible social science and should never have been published in the first place. There is no evidence that non-citizens have voted in recent U.S. elections ... It is bad research, because it fails to understand basic facts about the data it uses. Indeed, it took me and my colleagues only a few hours to figure out why the authors' findings were wrong and to produce the evidence needed to prove as much. The authors were essentially basing their claims on two pieces of data associated with the large survey—a question that asks people whether they are citizens and official vote records to which each respondent has been matched to determine whether he or she had voted. Both these pieces of information include some small amounts of measurement error, as is true of all survey questions. What the authors failed to consider is that measurement error was entirely responsible for their results. In fact, once my colleagues and I accounted for that error, we found that there were essentially zero non-citizens who voted in recent elections.` [link](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/11/donald-trump-illegal-votes-evidence-debunked-214487)

- On 12 January 2017, `Guccifer 2.0` released a blog post stating that accusations of ties with the Russian Government were unfounded.

    - The technical evidence contained in the reports doesn’t stand up to scrutiny. This is a crude fake.  
    -   
    - Any IT professional can see that a malware sample mentioned in the Joint Analysis Report was taken from the web and was commonly available. A lot of hackers use it. I think it was inserted in the report to make it look a bit more plausible.`

    - `On June 9, 2016, senior representatives of the Trump Campaign met in Trump Tower with a Russian attorney expecting to receive derogatory information about Hillary Clinton from the Russian government. The meeting was proposed to Donald Trump Jr. in an email from Robert Goldstone, at the request of his then-client Emin Agalarov, the son of Russian real-estate developer Aras Agalarov. Goldstone relayed to Trump Jr. that the “Crown prosecutor of Russia... offered to provide the Trump Campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia” as part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.” Trump Jr. immediately responded that “if it’s what you say I love it,” and arranged the meeting through a series of emails and telephone calls.` - Mueller Report [link](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download)

### Papadopoulos’ Meets Mifsud About `dirt` on Clinton, Opening Crossfire Hurricane Investigation
- On 26 April 2016, Papadopoulos’ Meets Mifsud, Mifsud says they have thousands of Clinton’s emails, namely `dirt`.
    
    - `After a stop in Rome, Mifsud returned to England on April 25, 2016. The next day, Papadopoulos met Mifsud for breakfast at the Andaz Hotel (the same location as their last meeting). During that meeting, Mifsud told Papadopoulos that he had met with high-level  
    - Russian government officials during his recent trip to Moscow. Mifsud also said that, on the trip, he learned that the Russians had obtained “dirt” on candidate Hillary Clinton. As Papadopoulos later stated to the FBI, Mifsud said that the “dirt” was in the form of “emails of Clinton,” and that they “have thousands of emails.”` - Mueller Report  
    - [link](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download)
    
- On 6 May 2016, Papadopoulos’ relays this `dirt` to Alexander Downer, the Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom.
    
    - `On May 6, 2016, 10 days after that meeting with Mifsud, Papadopoulos suggested to a representative of a foreign government that the Trump Campaign had received indications from the Russian government that it could assist the Campaign through the anonymous release of information that would be damaging to Hillary Clinton.` - Mueller Report [link](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download)
    
    - `In late April, at a London hotel, Mr. Mifsud told Mr. Papadopoulos that he had just learned from high-level Russian officials in Moscow that the Russians had “dirt” on Mrs. Clinton in the form of “thousands of emails,” according to court documents. Although Russian hackers had been mining data from the Democratic National Committee’s computers for months, that information was not yet public. Even the committee itself did not know.  
    -   
    - Whether Mr. Papadopoulos shared that information with anyone else in the campaign is one of many unanswered questions. He was mostly in contact with the campaign over emails. The day after Mr. Mifsud’s revelation about the hacked emails, he told Mr. Miller in an email only that he had “interesting messages coming in from Moscow” about a possible trip. The emails obtained by The Times show no evidence that Mr. Papadopoulos discussed the stolen messages with the campaign.  
    -   
    - Not long after, however, he opened up to Mr. Downer, the Australian diplomat, about his contacts with the Russians. It is unclear whether Mr. Downer was fishing for that information that night in May 2016. The meeting at the bar came about because of a series of connections, beginning with an Israeli Embassy official who introduced Mr. Papadopoulos to another Australian diplomat in London.`  
    - [[howfbirussiainve]]
    
- On 26 July 2016, The Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom tells the U.S. Government about this `dirt` after the emails are released publicly through WikiLeaks.
    
    - `This information is contained in the FBI case-opening document and related materials. The information is law-enforcement sensitive (LES) and must be treated accordingly in any external dissemination. The foreign government conveyed this information to the U.S. government on July 26, 2016, a few days after WikiLeaks’s release of Clinton-related emails. The FBI opened its investigation of potential coordination between Russia and the Trump Campaign a few days later based on the information.` - Mueller Report [link](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download)
    
- On 31 July 2016, The FBI opened the Crossfire Hurricane Investigation in response to Papadopoulos’ claim of damaging material on Clinton from the Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom.
    
    - `July 2016 was also the month WikiLeaks first released emails stolen by the GRU from the DNC. On July 22, 2016, WikiLeaks posted thousands of internal DNC documents revealing information about the Clinton Campaign. Within days, there was public reporting that U.S. intelligence agencies had “high confidence” that the Russian government was behind the theft of emails and documents from the DNC. And within a week of the release, a foreign government informed the FBI about its May 2016 interaction with Papadopoulos and his statement that the Russian government could assist the Trump Campaign. On July 31, 2016, based on the foreign government reporting, the FBI opened an investigation into potential coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign.` - Mueller Report [link](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download)
    
### Trump Campaign’s Response to Reports About Russian Support for Trump
- On 26 February 2016, Reuters reported Russian ties to Flynn.
    
    - `Donald Trump is receiving foreign policy advice from a former U.S. military intelligence chief who wants the United States to work more closely with Russia to resolve global security issues, according to three sources.  
    -   
    - The sources, former foreign policy officials in past administrations, said retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, who was chief of the Defense Intelligence Agency under President Barack Obama from 2012-2014, has been informally advising Trump.  
    -   
    - Trump, who is leading the Republican race to be the party’s presidential candidate in November’s election, said earlier this month that he would soon release a list of his foreign policy advisers, but has yet to do so. The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment about Flynn.  
    -   
    - Flynn declined to comment when asked by Reuters whether he is advising Trump. Asked to describe his views about ties with Russia, he referred Reuters to his public statements.`  
    - [link](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-trump-advisor-idUSKCN0VZ2ZB)
    
- On 30 March 2016, Bloomberg reported Russian ties to Page.
    
    - `A globe-trotting American investment banker who's built a career on deals with Russia and its state-run gas company, Carter Page says his business has suffered directly from the U.S. economic sanctions imposed after Russia's escalating involvement in the Ukraine. When Donald Trump named him last week as one of his foreign-policy advisers, Page says his e-mail inbox filled up with positive notes from Russian contacts. “So many people who I know and have worked with have been so adversely affected by the sanctions policy,” Page said in a two-hour interview last week. “There's a lot of excitement in terms of the possibilities for creating a better situation.”` [link](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-30/trump-russia-adviser-carter-page-interview)
    
- On 21 July 2016, LA Times reported Russian ties to Manafort.
    
    - `For decades, Republican doctrine has viewed Russia as a power to mistrust. But in Donald Trump’s GOP, Moscow’s sins seem to matter less. The platform written at the GOP convention in Cleveland this week eliminated references to arming Ukraine in its fight with Russia, which seized the Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and has supported separatists in eastern Ukraine.  
    -   
    - Many in the party’s foreign policy establishment are outraged.  
    -   
    - They note that Trump’s campaign manager, Paul Manafort, had worked as a consultant for the now-ousted pro-Russian government in Ukraine.  
    -   
    - Trump’s investments in hotels, golf courses and other business interests overseas already have raised concerns of potential conflicts of interest with U.S. policy if he is elected.`  
    - [[la]]
    
- On 27 July 2016, Trump during a campaign trail Press Conference, claimed that the Russia ties claims were a total deflection and that that closest he came to Russia was possible buying property’s, which was false as there were plans to make a Trump Tower Moscow discussed between September 2015 and June 2016.
    
    - `In a press conference the next day, July 27, 2016, Trump characterized “this whole thing with Russia” as “a total deflection” and stated that it was “farfetched” and “ridiculous.” Trump said that the assertion that Russia had hacked the emails was unproven, but stated that it would give him “no pause” if Russia had Clinton’s emails. Trump added, “Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.” Trump also said that “there’s nothing that I can think of that I’d rather do than have Russia friendly as opposed to the way they are right now,” and in response to a question about whether he would recognize Crimea as Russian territory and consider lifting sanctions, Trump replied, “We’ll be looking at that. Yeah, we’ll be looking.”  
    -   
    - During the press conference, Trump repeated “I have nothing to do with Russia” five times. He stated that “the closest [he] came to Russia” was that Russians may have purchased a home or condos from him. He said that after he held the Miss Universe pageant in Moscow in 2013 he had been interested in working with Russian companies that “wanted to put a lot of money into developments in Russia” but “it never worked out.” He explained, “[f]rankly, I didn’t want to do it for a couple of different reasons. But we had a major developer . . . that wanted to develop property in Moscow and other places. But we decided not to do it.” The Trump Organization, however, had been pursuing a building project in Moscow—the Trump Tower Moscow project— from approximately September 2015 through June 2016, and the candidate was regularly updated on developments, including possible trips by Michael Cohen to Moscow to promote the deal and by Trump himself to finalize it.` - Mueller Report

- On 19 August 2016, Manafort was asked to resign from the Trump Campaign because of the media coverage of his ties to Russia.
    
    - `On August 19, 2016, Manafort was asked to resign amid media coverage scrutinizing his ties to a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine and links to, Russian business.` - Mueller Report [link](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download)
    
    - `The Post's Robert Costa, Dan Balz and Jose A. DelReal have reported that Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort's resignation this morning was expected, following some campaign staff changes earlier in the week.  
    -   
    - But that wasn't the only news that preceded his exit. There were also a wave of fresh headlines dealing with investigations into his ties to a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine. Trump has come under fire from Democrats and Republicans with his friendly overtures to Russia — a country his party's 2012 nominee, Mitt Romney, called America's "No. 1 geopolitical foe." The recent revelations about Manafort's work in that part of the world did nothing to dismiss the image of a Trump campaign closer to Russia than many foreign policy experts were comfortable with.`

- On 23 September 2016, Page was terminated from the Trump Campaign because of the media coverage of his ties to Russia.
    
    - `And when the media published stories about Page’s connections to Russia in September 2016, Trump Campaign officials terminated Page’s association with the Campaign and told the press that he had played “no role” in the Campaign.` - Mueller Report [link](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download)
    
    - `U.S. intelligence officials are seeking to determine whether an American businessman identified by Donald Trump as one of his foreign policy advisers has opened up private communications with senior Russian officials — including talks about the possible lifting of economic sanctions if the Republican nominee becomes president, according to multiple sources who have been briefed on the issue.  
    -   
    - The activities of Trump adviser Carter Page, who has extensive business interests in Russia, have been discussed with senior members of Congress during recent briefings about suspected efforts by Moscow to influence the presidential election, the sources said. After one of those briefings, Senate minority leader Harry Reid wrote FBI Director James Comey, citing reports of meetings between a Trump adviser (a reference to Page) and “high ranking sanctioned individuals” in Moscow over the summer as evidence of “significant and disturbing ties” between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin that needed to be investigated by the bureau.`

### Intelligence Community Report
- On 6 January 2017, The Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a report on `Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections`. The report includes an assessment by the National Security Agency, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation of the type and breadth of actions undertaken by Russia and affiliated elements during the 2016 elections.
    
    - `We assess with high confidence that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election, the consistent goals of which were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump. When it appeared to Moscow that Secretary Clinton was likely to win the election, the Russian influence campaign then focused on undermining her expected presidency.` [link](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf) - Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections
    
    - `Moscow’s use of disclosures during the US election was unprecedented, but its influence campaign otherwise followed a longstanding Russian messaging strategy that blends covert intelligence operations—such as cyber activity—with overt efforts by Russian Government agencies, state-funded media, third-party intermediaries, and paid social media users or “trolls.”` [link](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf) - Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections
    
    - `Russia’s intelligence services conducted cyber operations against targets associated with the 2016 US presidential election,  
    - including targets associated with both major US political parties.  
    -   
    - We assess Russian intelligence services collected against the US primary campaigns, think tanks, and lobbying groups they viewed as likely to shape future US policies. In July 2015, Russian intelligence gained access to Democratic National Committee (DNC) networks and maintained that access until at least June 2016.`

    - `Russia’s state-run propaganda machine—comprised of its domestic media apparatus, outlets targeting global audiences such as RT and Sputnik, and a network of quasi-government trolls—contributed to the influence campaign by serving as a platform for Kremlin messaging to Russian and international audiences. State-owned Russian media made increasingly favorable comments about President-elect Trump as the 2016 US and primary election campaigns progressed while consistently offering negative coverage of Secretary Clinton.` [link](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf) - Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections
    
    - `Russia’s effort to influence the 2016 US presidential election represented a significant escalation in directness, level of activity, and scope of effort compared to previous operations aimed at US elections. We assess the 2016 influence campaign reflected the Kremlin’s recognition of the worldwide effects that mass disclosures of US Government and other private data—such as those conducted by WikiLeaks and others—have achieved in recent years, and their understanding of the value of orchestrating such disclosures to maximize the impact of compromising information.` [link](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf) - Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections

    - Ivanovich Kislyak . . . .” The text of the email read, “RE: setting up a time to meet w/you on 12/1. LMK how to proceed.” Kushner responded in relevant part, “I think I do this one -- confirm with Dimitri [Simes of CNI] that this is the right guy.” After reaching out to a colleague of Simes at CNI, Vargas reported back to Kushner that Kislyak was “the best go-to guy for routine matters in the US,” while Yuri Ushakov, a Russian foreign policy advisor, was the contact for “more direct/substantial matters.”` - Mueller Report

But I ask Russia to do is to not, if anything, I know you have to have some sort of action, to only make it reciprocal; don't go any further than you have to because I don't want us to get into something that have to escalate to tit-for-tat.

    - Flynn: I know! Believe me I do! I very much appreciate it! But I really do not want us to get into the situation where we everybody goes back and forth and everybody had to be a tough guy here. We don't need that right now. We need cool heads to prevail. And we need to be very steady about what we are going to do because we have absolutely a common threat in the Middle East.  
    -   
    - Kislyak agrees. Now when FSB and GRU are sanctioned and Kislyak asks himself, does it mean that the U.S. is not willing to work on terrorist threats, Kislyak poses a question. Flynn says, yes.

- On 12 January 2017, Flynn Makes False Public Statements About his Communications with Kislyak to Incoming Administration Officials, the Media, and the FBI.
    
    - `On January 12, 2017, a Washington Post columnist reported that Flynn and Kislyak communicated on the day the Obama Administration announced the Russia sanctions. The column questioned whether Flynn had said something to “undercut the U.S. sanctions” and  
    - whether Flynn’s communications had violated the letter or spirit of the Logan Act.  
    -   
    - President-Elect Trump called Priebus after the story was published and expressed anger about it. Priebus recalled that the President-Elect asked, “What the hell is this all about?” Priebus called Flynn and told him that the President-Elect was angry about the reporting on Flynn’s conversations with Kislyak. Flynn recalled that he felt a lot of pressure because Priebus had spoken to the “boss” and said Flynn needed to “kill the story.” Flynn directed McFarland to call the Washington Post columnist and inform him that no discussion of sanctions had occurred. McFarland recalled that Flynn said words to the effect of, “I want to kill the story.” McFarland made the call as Flynn had requested although she knew she was providing false information, and the Washington Post updated the column to reflect that a “Trump official” had denied that Flynn and Kislyak discussed sanctions.  
    -   
    - When Priebus and other incoming Administration officials questioned Flynn internally about the Washington Post column, Flynn maintained that he had not discussed sanctions with Kislyak. Flynn repeated that claim to Vice President-Elect Michael Pence and to incoming press secretary Sean Spicer. In subsequent media interviews in mid-January, Pence, Priebus, and Spicer denied that Flynn and Kislyak had discussed sanctions, basing those denials on their conversations with Flynn.` - Mueller Report

- On 12 January 2017, Trump reacted angrily to the article by The Washington Post. Trump’s incoming chief-of-staff, Reince Priebus, told Flynn of this, stating: "Kill the story". Flynn instructed aide McFarland to lie to The Washington Post that Flynn had not discussed the sanctions with Kislyak on December 29. McFarland knew this was false, but followed Flynn's instructions.

- On 12 January 2017, The Washington Post reported the denial of the contents of Flynn’s call with Kislyak.
    
    - `The Trump transition team did not respond Thursday night to a request for comment. But two team members called with information Friday morning. A first Trump official confirmed that Flynn had spoken with Kislyak by phone, but said the calls were before sanctions were announced and didn’t cover that topic. This official later added that Flynn’s initial call was to express condolences to Kislyak after the terrorist killing of the Russian ambassador to Ankara Dec. 19, and that Flynn made a second call Dec. 28 to express condolences for the shoot-down of a Russian plane carrying a choir to Syria. In that second call, Flynn also discussed plans for a Trump-Putin conversation sometime after the inauguration. In addition, a second Trump official said the Dec. 28 call included an invitation from Kislyak for a Trump administration official to visit Kazakhstan for a conference in late January.` [link](http://archive.ph/CGhKS)
    
- On 22 January 2017, The Wall Street Journal reported that Flynn was under investigation by U.S. counterintelligence agents for his communications with Russian officials.
    
    - `U.S. counterintelligence agents have investigated communications that President Donald Trump’s national security adviser had with Russian officials, according to people familiar with the matter.  
    -   
    - Michael Flynn is the first person inside the White House under Mr. Trump whose communications are known to have faced scrutiny as part of investigations by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Central Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency and Treasury Department to determine the extent of Russian government contacts with people close to Mr. Trump.  
    -   
    - It isn’t clear when the counterintelligence inquiry began, whether it produced any incriminating evidence or if it is continuing. Mr. Flynn, a retired general who became national security adviser with Mr. Trump’s inauguration, plays a key role in setting U.S. policy toward Russia.`

- On 13 February 2017, Flynn resigned as National Security Advisor, writing that he had given "incomplete information" of his conversations with Kislyak.
    
    - `In the course of my duties as the incoming National Security Advisor, I held numerous phone calls with foreign counterparts, ministers, and ambassadors. These calls were to facilitate a smooth transition and begin to build the necessary relationships between the President, his advisors and foreign leaders. Such calls are standard practice in any transition of this magnitude.  
    -   
    - Unfortunately, because of the fast pace of events, I inadvertently briefed the Vice President Elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian Ambassador. I have sincerely apologized to the President and the Vice President, and they have accepted apology.  
    -   
    - Throughout my over thirty three years of honorable military service, and my tenure as the National Security Advisor, I have always performed my duties with the upmost of integrity and honesty to those I have served, to include the President of the United States.

    - I am tendering resignation, honored to have served our nation and the American people in such a distinguished way.`

- On 14 February 2017, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said that Trump had asked for Flynn to resign, "not based on a legal issue, but based on a trust issue", due to "misleading the Vice President and others, or the possibility that he had forgotten critical details of this important conversation", which "created a critical mass and an unsustainable situation".
    
    - `Q: No — the other question is, just getting back to what was asked a few moments ago about trust and being misled. Are you saying that the national security advisor was intentionally misleading the President, the Vice President, yourself when he made these comments to you about that conversation?  
    -   
    - MR. SPICER: No, look, the trust is given by the President. It’s a relationship between he and any individual. And so, as I mentioned in the comments, maybe it was because — I don’t know that it was intentional, he may have just forgotten, but I think at some point trust isn’t just —  
    -   
    - Q: Isn’t that kind of a weird thing to forget, though, in a conversation where you talk about —  
    -   
    - MR. SPICER: But that’s the point, Jim, is that at some point that trust eroded to a point where the President did not feel comfortable with him serving in that position, and asked for and received his resignation.`

- On 15 February 2017, Flynn was Interviewed in a Deposition to the FBI, in which he said he didn’t ask Kislyak about escalation from Russia because of the sanctions end expelling of diplomats.
    
    - `The interviewing agents asked FLYNN if he recalled any with KISLYAK in which the expulsions were discussed, where FLYNN might have encouraged KISLYAK not to escalate the situation, to keep the Russian response reciprocal, or not to engage in a "tit—for—tat. t'  
    - FLYNN responded, "Not really. I don't It wasn't, t Don't do anything. remember. The U.S. Government 's response was a total surprise to FLYNN. FLYNN did not know about the Persona Non—Grata (PNG) action until it was in the media. KISLYAK and FLYNN were starting off on a good footing and FLYNN was looking forward to the relationship. With regard to the scope of the Russians who were expelled, FLYNN said he did not understand it. FLYNN stated he could understand one PNG, but not thirty—five.` - Flynn FBI Interview Report

- On 5 November 2017, NBC News reported that Robert Mueller had enough evidence for charges against Flynn and his son, Michael G. Flynn.
    
    - `Federal investigators have gathered enough evidence to bring charges in their investigation of President Donald Trump's former national security adviser and his son as part of the probe into Russia's intervention in the 2016 election, according to multiple sources familiar with the investigation.  
    -   
    - Michael T. Flynn, who was fired after just 24 days on the job, was one of the first Trump associates to come under scrutiny in the federal probe now led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller into possible collusion between Moscow and the Trump campaign.  
    -   
    - Mueller is applying renewed pressure on Flynn following his indictment of Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, three sources familiar with the investigation told NBC News.  
    -   
    - The investigators are speaking to multiple witnesses in coming days to gain more information surrounding Flynn's lobbying work, including whether he laundered money or lied to federal agents about his overseas contacts, according to three sources familiar with the investigation.`

- On 1 December 2017, Flynn and special counsel Robert Mueller agreed to a plea bargain in the District of Columbia's U.S. District Court. In the agreement, Flynn pleaded guilty to "willfully and knowingly" making "false, fictitious and fraudulent statements" to the FBI regarding conversations with Russia's ambassador.
    
    - `Michael Flynn, President Donald Trump’s former national security adviser, pleaded guilty Friday to lying to the FBI about his postelection contacts with Russia’s ambassador to the United States — and is now cooperating with a probe into links between the Trump campaign and Russia.  
    -   
    - Flynn surrendered Friday morning before a hearing in Washington federal court, where he admitted guilty to a single criminal count of knowingly making materially false, fictitious and fraudulent statements to FBI agents.  
    -   
    - That charge against the retired Army lieutentant general was lodged by prosecutors for special counsel Robert Mueller, who is probing alleged connections between the Trump presidential campaign with Russians.  
    -   
    - Mueller’s office in a court filing said “Flynn’s false statements and omissions impeded and otherwise had a material impact on the FBI’s ongoing investigation into the existence of any links or coordination between individuals associated with the Campaign and Russia’s effort to interfere with the 2016 presidential election.”`  
    - [[courtschedu]]
    
    - `President Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, pleaded guilty on Friday to lying to the F.B.I. about conversations with the Russian ambassador last December, becoming the first senior White House official to cut a cooperation deal in the special counsel’s wide-ranging inquiry into election interference.  
    -   
    - Mr. Flynn’s discussions with Sergey I. Kislyak, the Russian ambassador, were part of a coordinated effort by Mr. Trump’s aides to create foreign policy before they were in power, documents released as part of Mr. Flynn’s plea agreement show. Their efforts undermined the existing policy of President Barack Obama and flouted a warning from a senior Obama administration official to stop meddling in foreign affairs before the inauguration.  
    -   
    - The documents do not disclose what Mr. Trump knew about Mr. Flynn’s discussions. But in at least one instance, prosecutors say, Mr. Flynn was directed by a “very senior member” of the presidential transition team to discuss a United Nations resolution. Mr. Trump’s lawyers believe that unnamed aide was Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and close adviser, Jared Kushner, according to a lawyer briefed on the matter.`

- On 2 December 2017, President Trump stated that he "had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI", noting that Flynn had "pled guilty to those lies".
    
    - `President Donald Trump in a tweet on Saturday said he fired his former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn because Flynn lied to the vice president — and the FBI.  
    -   
    - If that is indeed the case, that means Trump knew that Flynn had lied to the FBI when he asked FBI Director James Comey to drop his inquiry into Flynn and then fired Comey when he failed to do so.  
    -   
    - “I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI,” Trump said in a midday tweet. “He has pled guilty to those lies. It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful. There was nothing to hide!”`

- On 21 December 2017, Pence stated to CBS News that by the time Flynn departed the Trump administration, "I knew that he lied to me". Pence also said that Trump "made the right decision" to remove Flynn.
    
    - `Vice President Mike Pence told CBS News' Margaret Brennan Thursday that he knew former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn had lied to him about his contacts with the Russians when Flynn was fired in February. Brennan spoke with Pence during the vice president's surprise trip to Afghanistan.  
    -   
    - Flynn, who's now cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller's probe of Russian election interference, pled guilty last month to lying to the FBI. He told investigators he'd never discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia with a Russian ambassador when those sanctions were imposed by the Obama administration shortly after the 2016 election.  
    -   
    - Before Flynn's claim was publicly revealed as a lie, however, it was repeated by Pence during a January 15 interview with Face the Nation moderator John Dickerson. Pence said he'd spoken with Flynn about his Christmas Day interaction with a Russian envoy. "He had sent a text to the Russian ambassador to express not only Christmas wishes but sympathy for the loss of life in the airplane crash that took place," Pence said. "It was strictly coincidental that they had a conversation. They did not discuss anything having to do with the United States' decision to expel diplomats or impose censure against Russia."

### Steele Dossier & it Becoming Public
- The Steele Dossier is a unfinished 35-page political opposition research report of raw intelligence written from June to December 2016 based on information from initially anonymous sources known to the author, counterintelligence specialist, Christopher Steele, a former head of the Russia Desk for British intelligence (MI6), containing allegations of misconduct, conspiracy, and cooperation between Donald Trump's presidential campaign and the government of Russia prior to and during the 2016 election campaign.
- On 19 September 2016, Steele's FBI handling agent sent six of Steele's reports (80, 94, 95, 100, 101, and 102) to the Crossfire Hurricane team, 3 months after the investigation started. This was the first time they and their leader, Deputy Assistant Director of the FBI's Counterespionage Section, Peter Strzok, received any of Steele's reporting.
    
    - `On September 19, 2016, the Crossfire Hurricane team received the Steele reporting for the first time when Handling Agent 1 emailed SSA 1 six reports for SSA 1 to upload himself to the sub-file: Reports 80 and 94, and four additional reports (Reports 95, 100, 101, and 102) that Handling Agent 1 had since received from Steele. 226 FBI officials we interviewed told us that the length of time it took for Steele's election reporting to reach FBI Headquarters was excessive and that the reports should have been sent promptly after their receipt by the Legat. Members of the Crossfire Hurricane team told us that their assessment of the Steele election reporting could have started much earlier if the reporting had been made available to them.` - Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation [link](https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf)
    
    - `After obtaining the six Steele reports on September 19, analysts on the Crossfire Hurricane team immediately began to evaluate the information in the reports. By the next day, they had completed a draft Intelligence Memorandum that summarized key points from the reports and identified actions that needed to be taken to assess the information.` - Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation [link](https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf)

    - A dossier of compromising material on Hillary CLINTON has been collated by the Russian Intelligence Services over many years and mainly comprises bugged conversations she had on various visits to Russia and intercepted phone calls rather than any embarrassing conduct. The dossier is controlled by Kremlin spokesman, PESKOV, directly on PUTIN's orders. However it has not as yet been distributed abroad, including to TRUMP. Russian intentions for its deployment still unclear` - Steele Dossier

- On 10 January 2017, Trump briefed on the Steele Dossier claims by Intelligence Community leaders.
    
    - `Classified documents presented last week to President Obama and President-elect Trump included allegations that Russian operatives claim to have compromising personal and financial information about Mr. Trump, multiple US officials with direct knowledge of the briefings tell CNN.  
    -   
    - The allegations were presented in a two-page synopsis that was appended to a report on Russian interference in the 2016 election. The allegations came, in part, from memos compiled by a former British intelligence operative, whose past work US intelligence officials consider credible. The FBI is investigating the credibility and accuracy of these allegations, which are based primarily on information from Russian sources, but has not confirmed many essential details in the memos about Mr. Trump.  
    -   
    - The classified briefings last week were presented by four of the senior-most US intelligence chiefs – Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, FBI Director James Comey, CIA Director John Brennan, and NSA Director Admiral Mike Rogers.`

- On 11 January 2017, Trump during a Press Conference said that the dossier was a disgrace and claimed to have no dealings with Russia due to it being a conflict of interest.
    
    - `In a press conference the next day, the President-Elect called the release “an absolute disgrace” and said, “I have no dealings with Russia. I have no deals that could happen in Russia, because we’ve stayed away. . . . So I have no deals, I have no loans and I have no dealings. We could make deals in Russia very easily if we wanted to, I just don’t want to because I think that would be a conflict.”` - Mueller Report [link](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download)
    
- On 23 July 2018, Trump tweeted that the Steele Dossier was the reason the Special Counsel investigation began, which was untrue.
    
    - `So we now find out that it was indeed the unverified and Fake Dirty Dossier, that was paid for by Crooked Hillary Clinton and the DNC, that was knowingly & falsely submitted to FISA and which was responsible for starting the totally conflicted and discredited Mueller Witch Hunt!` [link](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1021341698734030848?s=20)
    
- On 9 December 2019, the Office of the Inspector General released a redacted report which mentioned that Steele's reporting wasn't taken at face value, and at every attempt the FBI would verify the sources of any claims. The report notes that the Office of the Inspector General asked the Crossfire Hurricane team if they were concerned about the financial source of the research provided to the FBI. The team replied that it was not a concern for the analysts.
    
    - `Assistant Director (AD) E.W. "Bill" Priestap and then Deputy Assistant Director (DAD) Peter Strzok told the OIG that the FBl's assessment of Steele's information was not different from the approach the FBI typically uses in evaluating CHS information. They explained that the assessment involved determining the credibility of Steele, including understanding his record of furnishing reliable information, motivation, and possible biases; and verifying the information he provided through independent sources. Priestap described the FBI's approach to the reporting in the following terms:  
    -   
    - [W]e did not ever take the information he provided at face value .... We went to great lengths to try to independently verify the source's credibility and to prove or disprove every single assertion in the dossier.... We absolutely understood that the information in the socalled dossier could be inaccurate. We also understood that some parts could be true and other parts false. We understood that information could be embellished or exaggerated. We also understood that the information could have been provided by the Russians as part of a disinformation campaign.  
    -   
    - The Supervisory Intelligence Analyst (Supervisory Intel Analyst) assigned to Crossfire Hurricane told the OIG that an early focus of the FBI's analytical effort to assess Steele's reporting was trying to identify Steele's sources. According to the Supervisory Intel Analyst, it was important to determine whether the reporting of those individuals matched their access to information. The Supervisory Intel Analyst said that, in order to evaluate that issue and fully assess the reporting, the FBI sought assistance from other USIC agencies by, for example, vetting Russian names identified in the reports.  
    -   
    - We asked the Supervisory Intel Analyst whether the FBI sought to determine who was financing Steele's election related research. He said that the focus of the analysts was on Russian interference in the campaign and on any connections between Russia and the Trump campaign. He stated that he was aware of the potential for political influences on the reporting. He said that, because of that awareness, whether the reporting was "opposition research" that was politically motivated was not an issue that occupied his or his analysts' attention and that further research on the issue was nearly "immaterial." He explained that because "opposition research can be true, it can be false," his focus was on vetting the reporting to determine whether its contents were accurate.` - Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation

    -   
    - “During the course of the last several weeks, I have met with the relevant senior career Department officials to discuss whether I should recuse myself from any matters arising from the campaigns for President of the United States.  
    -

    -   
    - “I have taken no actions regarding any such matters, to the extent they exist.

Sessions said he had the impression that the President feared that the investigation could spin out of control and disrupt his ability to govern, which Sessions could have helped avert if he were still overseeing it.` - Mueller Report [link](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download)
    
### Trump Firing Comey, Starting Mueller’s Investigation
- On 26 April - 2 May 2017, Trump told advisors that he wanted Comey to make public that Trump was not under investigation at Comey’s upcoming hearing and if not that this would be Comey’s final straw.
    
    - `McGahn recalled that in the week leading up to the hearing the President said that it would be the last straw if Comey did not take the opportunity to set the record straight by publicly announcing that the President was not under investigation. The President  
    - had previously told McGahn that the perception that the President was under investigation was hurting his ability to carry out his presidential duties and deal with foreign leaders.` - Mueller Report  
    - [link](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download)
    
- On 3 May 2017, Comey testifies at an annual FBI Oversight hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, in which he was asked whether Trump was under investigation.
    
    - `At the hearing, Comey declined to answer questions about the status of the Russia investigation, stating “[t]he Department of Justice ha[d] authorized [him] to confirm that [the Russia investigation] exists,” but that he was “not going to say another word about it” until the investigation was completed. Comey also declined to answer questions about whether investigators had “ruled out anyone in the Trump campaign as potentially a target of th[e] criminal investigation,” including whether the FBI had “ruled out the president of the United States.”` - Mueller Report [link](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download)
    
    - `Sen. Blumenthal: You have confirmed, I believe, that the FBI is investigating potential ties between Trump associates and the Russian interference in the 2016 campaign, correct?  
    -   
    - Dir. Comey: Yes.  
    -   
    - Sen. Blumenthal: And you have not, to my knowledge, ruled out anyone in the Trump campaign as potentially a target of that criminal investigation, correct?  
    -   
    - Dir. Comey: I haven‘t said anything publicly about who we have opened investigations on. I briefed the chair and ranking on who the people are. I can't go beyond that in this setting.  
    -   
    - Sen. Blumenthal: Have you ruled out anyone in the campaign that you can disclose?  
    -   
    - Dir. Comey: I don't feel comfortable answering that, senator, because I think it puts me on a slope to talk about who we are investigating.  
    -   
    - Sen. Blumenthal: Have you ruled out the president of the United States?  
    -   
    - Dir. Comey: I don‘t want people to overinterpret this answer. I'm not going to comment on anyone in particular because that puts me down a slope of, because if I say no to that then I have to answer succeeding questions. So what we’ve done is we briefed the chair and ranking on who the U.S. persons are that we have opened investigations on and that is as far as we are going to go at this point.`

At that meeting, the President asked McGahn how Comey had done in his testimony and McGahn relayed that Comey had declined to answer questions about whether the President was under investigation. The President became very upset and directed his anger at Sessions. According to notes written by Hunt, the President said, “This is terrible Jeff. It’s all because you recused. AG is supposed to be most important appointment. Kennedy appointed his brother. Obama appointed Holder. I appointed you and you recused yourself. You left me on an island. I can’t do anything.” The President said that the recusal was unfair and that it was interfering with his ability to govern and undermining his authority with foreign leaders. Sessions responded that he had had no choice but to recuse, and it was a mandatory rather than discretionary decision.` - Mueller Report [link](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download)
    
- On 3 May 2017, Trump privately expressed considering replacing Comey as FBI Director.
    
    - `Hunt recalled that Sessions also stated at some point during the conversation that a new start at the FBI would be appropriate and the President should consider replacing Comey as FBI director. According to Sessions, when the meeting concluded, it was clear that the President was unhappy with Comey, but Sessions did not think the President had made the decision to terminate Comey.` - Mueller Report [link](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download)
    
- On 5-7 May 2017, Trump privately discussed with advisors the idea of including that Trump was not under investigation and other phraseology of the termination letter to be sent to Comey. This also included wanting to make the story around Comey’s firing to look like a culmination of his actions in a review period, rather than the FBI investigation.
    
    - `At a dinner on Friday, May 5, attended by the President and various advisors and family members, including Jared Kushner and senior advisor Stephen Miller, the President stated that he wanted to remove Comey and had ideas for a letter that would be used to make the announcement. The President dictated arguments and specific language for the letter, and Miller took notes. As reflected in the notes, the President told Miller that the letter should start, “While I greatly appreciate you informing me that I am not under investigation concerning what I have often stated is a fabricated story on a Trump-Russia relationship – pertaining to the 2016 presidential election, please be informed that I, and I believe the American public – including Ds and Rs – have lost faith in you as Director of the FBI.” Following the dinner, Miller prepared a termination letter based on those notes and research he conducted to  
    - support the President’s arguments. Over the weekend, the President provided several rounds of edits on the draft letter. Miller said the President was adamant that he not tell anyone at the White House what they were preparing because the President was worried about leaks.  
    -   
    - In his discussions with Miller, the President made clear that he wanted the letter to open with a reference to him not being under investigation. Miller said he believed that fact was important to the President to show that Comey was not being terminated based on any such investigation. According to Miller, the President wanted to establish as a factual matter that Comey had been under a “review period” and did not have assurance from the President that he would be permitted to keep his job.` - Mueller Report  
    - [link](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download)
    
- On 9 May 2017, Trump fired Comey by way of a termination letter in which he stated that he was acting on the recommendation of Sessions and Rosenstein which was included with the letter.
    
    - `I have received the attached letters from the Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General of the United States recommending your dismissal as the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. I have accepted their recommendation and you are hereby terminated and removed from office, effective immediately.  
    -   
    - While I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation, I nevertheless concur with the judgment of the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the Bureau.  
    -   
    - It is essential that we find new leadership for the FBI that restores public trust and confidence in its vital law enforcement mission.`

- On 17 May 2017, Robert Mueller is appointed Special Counsel by Rosenstein and was authorized to continue Comey’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation. Trump was not personally under investigation, until his firing of Comey raised suspicions of obstruction of justice, which triggered the Mueller investigation.
    
    - `The Special Counsel is authorized to conduct the investigation confirmed by then-FBI Director James B. Comey in testimony before the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence on March 20, 2017, including:  
    -   
    - (i) any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump; and  
    - (ii) any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation; and  
    - (iii) any other matters within the scope of 28 C.F.R. § 600.4(a).`

    - `Soon after the firing of Comey and the appointment of the Special Counsel, however, the President became aware that his own conduct was being investigated in an obstruction-of-justice inquiry.` - Mueller Report [link](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download)
    
- On 8 June 2017, Comey publicly testified to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence that he told Trump, on three occasions, that Trump was not personally under investigation and provided memos of such occasions between Trump and Comey.
    
    - `On the morning of March 30, the President called me at the FBI. He described the Russia investigation as “a cloud” that was impairing his ability to act on behalf of the country. He said he had nothing to do with Russia, had not been involved with hookers in Russia, and had always assumed he was being recorded when in Russia. He asked what we could do to “lift the cloud.” I responded that we were investigating the matter as quickly as we could, and that there would be great benefit, if we didn’t find anything, to our having done the work well. He agreed, but then re-emphasized the problems this was causing him.  
    -   
    - Then the President asked why there had been a congressional hearing about Russia the previous week – at which I had, as the Department of Justice directed, confirmed the investigation into possible coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign. I explained the demands from the leadership of both parties in Congress for more information, and that Senator Grassley had even held up the confirmation of the Deputy Attorney General until we briefed him in detail on the investigation. I explained that we had briefed the leadership of Congress on exactly which individuals we were investigating and that we had told those Congressional leaders that we were not personally investigating President Trump. I reminded him I had previously told him that. He repeatedly told me, “We need to get that fact out.” (I did not tell the President that the FBI and the Department of Justice had been reluctant to make public statements that we did not have an open case on President Trump for a number of reasons, most importantly because it would create a duty to correct, should that change.)` Comey’s Statement for the Record for the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence -

### Trump Reacts to Mueller’s Investigation
- On 17 May 2017, Just after Mueller’s appointment, Trump expresses his discontent about Mueller’s Investigation to White House Staff and Sessions, claims that `This is the end of my Presidency` and that Sessions should of protected him.
    
    - `On May 17, 2017, Acting Attorney General Rosenstein appointed Robert S. Mueller, III as Special Counsel and authorized him to conduct the Russia investigation and matters that arose from the investigation. The President learned of the Special Counsel’s appointment from Sessions, who was with the President, Hunt, and McGahn conducting interviews for a new FBI Director. Sessions stepped out of the Oval Office to take a call from Rosenstein, who told him about the Special Counsel appointment, and Sessions then returned to inform the President of the news. According to notes written by Hunt, when Sessions told the President that a Special Counsel had been appointed, the President slumped back in his chair and said, “Oh my God. This is terrible. This is the end of my Presidency. I’m fucked.” The President became angry and lambasted the Attorney General for his decision to recuse from the investigation, stating, “How could you let this happen, Jeff?” The President said the position of Attorney General was his most important appointment and that Sessions had “let [him] down,” contrasting him to Eric Holder and Robert Kennedy. Sessions recalled that the President said to him, “you were supposed to protect me,” or words to that effect. The President returned to the consequences of the appointment and said, “Everyone tells me if you get one of these independent counsels it ruins your presidency. It takes years and years and I won’t be able to do anything. This is the worst thing that ever happened to me.”` - Mueller Report [link](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download)
    
- On 17 May 2017, Trump asks Sessions to submit his resignation.
    
    - `The President then told Sessions he should resign as Attorney General. Sessions agreed to submit his resignation and left the Oval Office.

Hicks said that she had only seen the President like that one other time, when the Access Hollywood tape came out during the campaign.` - Mueller Report [link](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download)
    
- On 18 May 2017, Sessions finalises the resignation letter and is asked by Trump if Sessions wants to still be Attorney General. after learning Trump was holding on to the letter, it is then viewed as a weapon Trump wielded over the DOJ.
    
    - `The next day, May 18, 2017, FBI agents delivered to McGahn a preservation notice that discussed an investigation related to Comey’s termination and directed the White House to preserve all relevant documents. When he received the letter, McGahn issued a document hold to White House staff and instructed them not to send out any burn bags over the weekend while he sorted things out.  
    -   
    - Also on May 18, Sessions finalized a resignation letter that stated, “Pursuant to our conversation of yesterday, and at your request, I hereby offer my resignation.” Sessions, accompanied by Hunt, brought the letter to the White House and handed it to the President. The President put the resignation letter in his pocket and asked Sessions several times whether he wanted to continue serving as Attorney General. Sessions ultimately told the President he wanted to stay, but it was up to the President. The President said he wanted Sessions to stay. At the conclusion of the meeting, the President shook Sessions’s hand but did not return the resignation letter.  
    -   
    - When Priebus and Bannon learned that the President was holding onto Sessions’s resignation letter, they became concerned that it could be used to influence the Department of Justice. Priebus told Sessions it was not good for the President to have the letter because it would function as a kind of “shock collar” that the President could use any time he wanted; Priebus said the President had “DOJ by the throat.” Priebus and Bannon told Sessions they would attempt to get the letter back from the President with a notation that he was not accepting Sessions’s resignation.` - Mueller Report

During the trip, Priebus asked about the resignation letter so he could return it to Sessions, but the President told him that the letter was back at the White House, somewhere in the residence.` - Mueller Report [link](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download)

### Trump Tries to Remove Mueller
- On 14 June 2017, The Washington Post releases an article revealing that Trump is under investigation for Obstruction of Justice.
    
    - `The special counsel overseeing the investigation into Russia’s role in the 2016 election is interviewing senior intelligence officials as part of a widening probe that now includes an examination of whether President Trump attempted to obstruct justice, officials said.  
    -   
    - The move by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III to investigate Trump’s conduct marks a major turning point in the nearly year-old FBI investigation, which until recently focused on Russian meddling during the presidential campaign and on whether there was any coordination between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin. Investigators have also been looking for any evidence of possible financial crimes among Trump associates, officials said.`

    - `On the evening of June 14, 2017, the Washington Post published an article stating that the Special Counsel was investigating whether the President had attempted to obstruct justice. This was the first public report that the President himself was under investigation by the Special Counsel’s Office, and cable news networks quickly picked up on the report. The Post story stated that the Special Counsel was interviewing intelligence community leaders, including Coats and Rogers, about what the President had asked them to do in response to Comey’s March 20, 2017 testimony; that the inquiry into obstruction marked “a major turning point” in the investigation; and that while “Trump had received private assurances from then-FBI Director James B. Comey starting in January that he was not personally under investigation,” “[o]fficials say that changed shortly after Comey’s firing.” That evening, at approximately 10:31 p.m., the President called McGahn on McGahn’s personal cell phone and they spoke for about 15 minutes. McGahn did not have a clear memory of the call but thought they might have discussed the stories reporting that the President was under investigation.` - Mueller Report [link](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download)
    
- On 15 & 16 June 2017, Trump tweets multiple times about the public revelation of the Obstruction of Justice investigation.
    
    - `Beginning early the next day, June 15, 2017, the President issued a series of tweets acknowledging the existence of the obstruction investigation and criticizing it. He wrote: “They made up a phony collusion with the Russians story, found zero proof, so now they go for obstruction of justice on the phony story. Nice”; “You are witnessing the single greatest WITCH HUNT in American political history—led by some very bad and conflicted people!”; and “Crooked H destroyed phones w/ hammer, ‘bleached’ emails, & had husband meet w/AG days before she was cleared—& they talk about obstruction?” The next day, June 16, 2017, the President wrote additional tweets criticizing the investigation: “After 7 months of investigations & committee hearings about my ‘collusion with the Russians,’ nobody has been able to show any proof. Sad!”; and “I am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI Director! Witch Hunt.”` - Mueller Report [link](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download)
    
- On 17 June 2017, Trump ordered McGahn to remove the Special Counsel citing conflicts of interest.
    
    - `On Saturday, June 17, 2017, the President called McGahn and directed him to have the Special Counsel removed. McGahn was at home and the President was at Camp David. In interviews with this Office, McGahn recalled that the President called him at home twice and on  
    - both occasions directed him to call Rosenstein and say that Mueller had conflicts that precluded him from serving as Special Counsel.  
    -   
    - On the first call, McGahn recalled that the President said something like, “You gotta do this. You gotta call Rod.” McGahn said he told the President that he would see what he could do. McGahn was perturbed by the call and did not intend to act on the request. He and other advisors believed the asserted conflicts were “silly” and “not real,” and they had previously communicated that view to the President. McGahn also had made clear to the President that the White House Counsel’s Office should not be involved in any effort to press the issue of conflicts. McGahn was concerned about having any role in asking the Acting Attorney General to fire the Special Counsel because he had grown up in the Reagan era and wanted to be more like Judge Robert Bork and not “Saturday Night Massacre Bork.” McGahn considered the President’s request to be an inflection point and he wanted to hit the brakes.  
    -   
    - When the President called McGahn a second time to follow up on the order to call the Department of Justice, McGahn recalled that the President was more direct, saying something like, “Call Rod, tell Rod that Mueller has conflicts and can’t be the Special Counsel.” McGahn recalled the President telling him “Mueller has to go” and “Call me back when you do it.” McGahn understood the President to be saying that the Special Counsel had to be removed by Rosenstein. To end the conversation with the President, McGahn left the President with the impression that McGahn would call Rosenstein. McGahn recalled that he had already said no to the President’s request and he was worn down, so he just wanted to get off the phone.` - Mueller Report

- On 17 June 2017, McGahn considers resigning in response to Trump’s request, decides against it and decided not to mention whether he followed through with it.
    
    - `McGahn recalled feeling trapped because he did not plan to follow the President’s directive but did not know what he would say the next time the President called. McGahn decided he had to resign. He called his personal lawyer and then called his chief of staff, Annie Donaldson, to inform her of his decision. He then drove to the office to pack his belongings and submit his resignation letter. Donaldson recalled that McGahn told her the President had called and demanded he contact the Department of Justice and that the President wanted him to do something that McGahn did not want to do. McGahn told Donaldson that the President had called at least twice and in one of the calls asked “have you done it?” McGahn did not tell Donaldson the specifics of the President’s request because he was consciously trying not to involve her in the investigation, but Donaldson inferred that the President’s directive was related to the Russia investigation. Donaldson prepared to resign along with McGahn.  
    -   
    - That evening, McGahn called both Priebus and Bannon and told them that he intended to resign. McGahn recalled that, after speaking with his attorney and given the nature of the President’s request, he decided not to share details of the President’s request with other White House staff. Priebus recalled that McGahn said that the President had asked him to “do crazy shit,” but he thought McGahn did not tell him the specifics of the President’s request because McGahn was trying to protect Priebus from what he did not need to know. Priebus and Bannon both urged McGahn not to quit, and McGahn ultimately returned to work that Monday and remained in his position. He had not told the President directly that he planned to resign, and when they next saw each other the President did not ask McGahn whether he had followed through with calling Rosenstein.` - Mueller Report

### Trump Tries to Limit Mueller’s Investigation
- On 19 July 2017, Trump meets with former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and discusses Sessions’ recusal, which led to Trump voicing a draft speech for Sessions.
    
    - `On June 19, 2017, two days after the President directed McGahn to have the Special Counsel removed, the President met one-on-one in the Oval Office with his former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. Senior White House advisors described Lewandowski as a “devotee” of the President and said the relationship between the President and Lewandowski was “close.”  
    -   
    - During the June 19 meeting, Lewandowski recalled that, after some small talk, the President brought up Sessions and criticized his recusal from the Russia investigation. The President told Lewandowski that Sessions was weak and that if the President had known about the likelihood of recusal in advance, he would not have appointed Sessions. The President then asked Lewandowski to deliver a message to Sessions and said “write this down.” This was the first time the President had asked Lewandowski to take dictation, and Lewandowski wrote as fast as possible to make sure he captured the content correctly.  
    -   
    - The President directed that Sessions should give a speech publicly announcing:  
    -   
    - I know that I recused myself from certain things having to do with specific areas. But our POTUS . . . is being treated very unfairly. He shouldn’t have a Special Prosecutor/Counsel b/c he hasn’t done anything wrong. I was on the campaign w/ him for nine months, there were no Russians involved with him. I know it for a fact b/c I was there. He didn’t do anything wrong except he ran the greatest campaign in American history.  
    -   
    - The dictated message went on to state that Sessions would meet with the Special Counsel to limit his jurisdiction to future election interference:  
    -   
    - Now a group of people want to subvert the Constitution of the United States. I am going to meet with the Special Prosecutor to explain this is very unfair and let the Special Prosecutor move forward with investigating election meddling for future elections so that nothing can happen in future elections.` - Mueller Report  
    - [link](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download)
    
- On 19 July 2017, Trump held an interview with The New York Times, in which he expressed more criticism of Sessions’ recusal.
    
    - `on July 19, 2017, the President gave an unplanned interview to the New York Times in which he criticized Sessions’s decision to  
    - recuse from the Russia investigation. The President said that “Sessions should have never recused himself, and if he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me before he took the job, and I would have picked somebody else.” Sessions’s recusal, the President said, was “very unfair to the president. How do you take a job and then recuse yourself? If he would have recused  
    - himself before the job, I would have said, ‘Thanks, Jeff, but I can’t, you know, I’m not going to take you.’ It’s extremely unfair, and that’s a mild word, to the president.” Hicks, who was present for the interview, recalled trying to “throw [herself] between the reporters and [the President]” to stop parts of the interview, but the President “loved the interview.”` - Mueller Report

- On 21 July 2017, The Washington Post reported that the U.S. intelligence heard Sessions talking about the campaign with Kislyak, despite Sessions saying he didn't talk about the campaign during his confirmation hearing.
    
    - `on July 21, 2017, the Washington Post reported that U.S. intelligence intercepts showed that Sessions had discussed campaign-related matters with the Russian ambassador, contrary to what Sessions had said publicly.` - Mueller Report [link](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download)
    
    - `Russia’s ambassador to Washington told his superiors in Moscow that he discussed campaign-related matters, including policy issues important to Moscow, with Jeff Sessions during the 2016 presidential race, contrary to public assertions by the embattled attorney general, according to current and former U.S. officials.  
    -   
    - Ambassador Sergey Kislyak’s accounts of two conversations with Sessions — then a top foreign policy adviser to Republican candidate Donald Trump — were intercepted by U.S. spy agencies, which monitor the communications of senior Russian officials in the United States and in Russia. Sessions initially failed to disclose his contacts with Kislyak and then said that the meetings were not about the Trump campaign.  
    -   
    - One U.S. official said that Sessions — who testified that he had no recollection of an April encounter — has provided “misleading” statements that are “contradicted by other evidence.” A former official said that the intelligence indicates that Sessions and Kislyak had “substantive” discussions on matters including Trump’s positions on Russia-related issues and prospects for U.S.-Russia relations in a Trump administration.`

- On 21 July 2017, Priebus and Hunt discuss Sessions’ resignation.
    
    - `That evening, Priebus called Hunt to talk about whether Sessions might be fired or might resign. Priebus had previously talked to  
    - Hunt when the media had reported on tensions between Sessions and the President, and, after speaking to Sessions, Hunt had told Priebus that the President would have to fire Sessions if he wanted to remove Sessions because Sessions was not going to quit. According to Hunt, who took contemporaneous notes of the July 21 call, Hunt told Priebus that, as they had previously discussed, Sessions had no intention of resigning. Hunt asked Priebus what the President would accomplish by firing Sessions, pointing out there was an investigation before and there would be an investigation after.` - Mueller Report

- On 22 July 2017, Trump tweeted remarks against The Washington Post reported leaks.
    
    - `Early the following morning, July 22, 2017, the President tweeted, “A new INTELLIGENCE LEAK from the Amazon Washington Post, this time against A.G. Jeff Sessions. These illegal leaks, like Comey’s, must stop!” Approximately one hour later, the President tweeted, “So many people are asking why isn’t the A.G. or Special Council looking at the many Hillary Clinton or Comey crimes. 33,000 e-mails deleted?”` - Mueller Report [link](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download)
    
- On 22 July 2017, Trump again mentions to Priebus his desire for Sessions to resign.
    
    - `Later that morning, while aboard Marine One on the way to Norfolk, Virginia, the President told Priebus that he had to get Sessions to resign immediately. The President said that the country had lost confidence in Sessions and the negative publicity was not tolerable. According to contemporaneous notes taken by Priebus, the President told Priebus to say that he “need[ed] a letter of resignation on [his] desk immediately” and that Sessions had “no choice” but “must immediately resign.” Priebus replied that if they fired Sessions, they would never get a new Attorney General confirmed and that the Department of Justice and Congress would turn their backs on the President, but the President suggested he could make a recess appointment to replace Sessions.` - Mueller Report [link](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download)
    
- On 22 July 2017, Priebus and Hunt discuss Trump request for Sessions’ resignation.
    
    - `Priebus believed that the President’s request was a problem, so he called McGahn and asked for advice, explaining that he did not want to pull the trigger on something that was “all wrong.” Although the President tied his desire for Sessions to resign to Sessions’s negative press and poor performance in congressional testimony, Priebus believed that the President’s desire to replace Sessions was driven by the President’s hatred of Sessions’s recusal from the Russia investigation. McGahn told Priebus not to follow the President’s order and said they should consult their personal counsel, with whom they had attorney-client privilege. McGahn and Priebus discussed the possibility that they would both have to resign rather than carry out the President’s order to fire Sessions.` - Mueller Report [link](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download)
    
- On 22 July 2017, Trump asks Priebus whether he got Sessions’ resignation letter. Later, Priebus mentions that if Sessions were to resign, that Deputy AG Rosenstein and Associate AG Brand would also resign causing turmoil in Congress when confirming appointments.
    
    - `That afternoon, the President followed up with Priebus about demanding Sessions’s resignation, using words to the effect of, “Did you get it? Are you working on it?” Priebus said that he believed that his job depended on whether he followed the order to remove Sessions, although the President did not directly say so. Even though Priebus did not intend to carry out the President’s directive, he told the President he would get Sessions to resign. Later in the day, Priebus called the President and explained that it would be a calamity if Sessions resigned because Priebus expected that Rosenstein and Associate Attorney General Rachel Brand would also resign and the President would be unable to get anyone else confirmed. The President agreed to hold off on demanding Sessions’s resignation until after the Sunday shows the next day, to prevent the shows from focusing on the firing.` - Mueller Report [link](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download)

    - `Over the next several days, the President tweeted about Sessions. On the morning of Monday, July 24, 2017, the President criticized Sessions for neglecting to investigate Clinton and called him “beleaguered.” On July 25, the President tweeted, “Attorney General Jeff Sessions has taken a VERY weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes (where are Emails & DNC server) & Intel leakers!” The following day, July 26, the President tweeted, “Why didn’t A.G. Sessions replace Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, a Comey friend who was in charge of Clinton investigation.” According to Hunt, in light of the President’s frequent public attacks, Sessions prepared another resignation letter and for the rest of the year carried it with him in his pocket every time he went to the White House.` - Mueller Report [link](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download)

    - `On January 25, 2018, the New York Times reported that in June 2017, the President had ordered McGahn to have the Department of Justice fire the Special Counsel. According to the article, “[a]mid the first wave of news media reports that Mr. Mueller was examining a possible obstruction case, the president began to argue that Mr. Mueller had three conflicts of interest that disqualified him from overseeing the investigation.” The article further reported that “[a]fter receiving the president’s order to fire Mr. Mueller, the White House counsel . . . refused to ask the Justice Department to dismiss the special counsel, saying he would quit instead.” The article stated that the president “ultimately backed down after the White House counsel threatened to resign rather than carry out the directive.”` - Mueller Report [link](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download)

    - `President Donald Trump denied on Friday that he had moved to fire special counsel Robert Mueller.  
    -   
    - He had called for the firing last June, according to one person familiar with the matter. White House counsel Don McGahn refused to order the Justice Department to fire Mueller because he disagreed with the President’s reasoning, the source said. However, according to the source, McGahn did not threaten to resign directly to the President.  
    -   
    - The New York Times was first to report that Trump called for Mueller’s departure in June 2017.

    - `The next day, the Washington Post reported on the same event but added that McGahn had not told the President directly that he intended to resign rather than carry out the directive to have the Special Counsel terminated. In that respect, the Post story clarified the Times story, which could be read to suggest that McGahn had told the President of his intention to quit, causing the President to back down from the order to have the Special Counsel fired.` - Mueller Report [link](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download)
    
    - `President Trump sought the firing of Robert S. Mueller III last June, shortly after the special counsel took over the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, and he backed off only after White House Counsel Donald F. McGahn threatened to resign over the move.

    - The extraordinary showdown was confirmed by two people familiar with the episode, which was first reported by the New York Times.

- On 26 January 2018, Trump asked McGahn to release a statement denying the Washington Post’s and the New York Times’ articles.
    
    - `On January 26, 2018, the President’s personal counsel called McGahn’s attorney and said that the President wanted McGahn to put out a statement denying that he had been asked to fire the Special Counsel and that he had threatened to quit in protest. McGahn’s attorney spoke with McGahn about that request and then called the President’s personal counsel to relay that McGahn would not make a statement. McGahn’s attorney informed the President’s personal counsel that the Times story was accurate in reporting that the President wanted the Special Counsel removed. Accordingly, McGahn’s attorney said, although the article was inaccurate in some other respects, McGahn could not comply with the President’s request to dispute the story. Hicks recalled relaying to the President that one of his attorneys had spoken to McGahn’s attorney about the issue.` - Mueller Report [link](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download)

    - `The next day, on February 5, 2018, the President complained about the Times article to Porter. The President told Porter that the article was “bullshit” and he had not sought to terminate the Special Counsel. The President said that McGahn leaked to the media to make himself look good. The President then directed Porter to tell McGahn to create a record to make clear that the President never directed McGahn to fire the Special Counsel. Porter thought the matter should be handled by the White House communications office, but the President said he wanted McGahn to write a letter to the file “for our records” and wanted something beyond a press statement to demonstrate that the reporting was inaccurate. The President referred to McGahn as a “lying bastard” and said that he wanted a record from him. Porter recalled the President saying something to the effect of, “If he doesn’t write a letter, then maybe I’ll have to get rid of him.”  
    -   
    - Later that day, Porter spoke to McGahn to deliver the President’s message. Porter told McGahn that he had to write a letter to dispute that he was ever ordered to terminate the Special Counsel. McGahn shrugged off the request, explaining that the media reports were true. McGahn told Porter that the President had been insistent on firing the Special Counsel and that McGahn had planned to resign rather than carry out the order, although he had not personally told the President he intended to quit. Porter told McGahn that the President suggested that McGahn would be fired if he did not write the letter. McGahn dismissed the threat, saying that the optics would be terrible if the President followed through with firing him on that basis. McGahn said he would not write the letter the President had requested. Porter said that to his knowledge the issue of McGahn’s letter never came up with the President again, but Porter did recall telling Kelly about his conversation with McGahn.` - Mueller Report

### Nunes & Schiff Memos
- On 18 January 2018, Devin Nunes, the then-Chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, released a memorandum that detailed alleged surveillance abuses by the FBI & DOJ during the investigation.
- The Nunes memo alleges that the FBI, in the process of seeking a FISA warrant from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to monitor the communications of Carter Page, a foreign policy advisor to Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, relied on the Steele dossier, an opposition research document funded by the DNC and the Hillary Clinton campaign, without adequately disclosing its political origins. The memo further alleges that the FBI failed to disclose to the FISC that the Steele dossier was partially funded by the DNC and the Clinton campaign, and that a source in the dossier was in touch with a senior DOJ official.
    
    - `1) The "dossier" compiled by Christopher Steele (Steele dossier) on behalf of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and the Hillary Clinton campaign formed an essential part of the Carter Page FISA application. Steele was a longtime FBI source who was paid over $160,000 by the DNC and Clinton campaign, Via the law 'firm Perkins Cole and research firm Fusion GPS, to obtain derogatory information on Donald Trump's ties to Russia.  
    -   
    - a) Neither the initial application in October 2016, nor any of the renewals, disclose or reference the role of the DNC, Clinton campaign, or. any party/campaign in funding Steele's efforts, even though the political origins of the Steele dossier were then known to senior DOJ and FBI officials.` - Nunes Memo  
    - [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20180921061353/https://intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/memo_and_white_house_letter.pdf)
    
- It also alleges that the FBI and DOJ had a political bias in favour of Clinton, citing the texts of senior FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page.
    
    - `Strzok was reassigned by the Special Counsel's Office to FBI Human Resources for improper text messages with his mistress, FBI Attorney Lisa Page (no known relation to Carter Page), where they both demonstrated a clear bias against Trump and in favor of Clinton, whom Strzok had also investigated. The Strzok/Lisa Page texts also reflect extensive discussions about the investigation, orchestrating leaks to the media, and include a meeting with Deputy Director McCabe to discuss an "insurance" policy against President Trump's election.` - Nunes Memo [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20180921061353/https://intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/memo_and_white_house_letter.pdf)
    
- The memo further argues that the FISA warrant would not have been issued without the Steele dossier.
    
    - `The Carter Page FISA application also cited extensively a September 23, 2016, Yahoo News article by Michael Isikoff, which focuses on Page's July 2016 trip to Moscow. This article does not corroborate the Steele dossier because it is derived from information leaked by Steele himself to Yahoo News. The Page FISA application incorrectly assesses that Steele did not directly provide information to Yahoo News. Steele has admitted in British court filings that he met with Yahoo News—and several other. outlets—in September 2016 at the direction of Fusion GPS. Perkins Coie was aware of Steele's initial media contacts because they hosted at least one meeting in Washington DC. in 2016 with Steele and Fusion GPS where this matter was discussed.` - Nunes Memo [link](https://irp.fas.org/congress/2018_cr/nunes-memo.pdf)
    
- The memo also confirmed, before the Mueller Report was finished, that the Steele Dossier was not the reason for the original FBI investigation opening, rather the reason then stated in the Mueller Report
    
    - `The Page FISA application also mentions information regarding fellow Trump campaign advisor George Papadopoulos, but there is no evidence of any cooperation or conspiracy between Page and Papadopoulos. The Papadopoulos information triggered the opening of an FBI counterintelligence investigation in late July 2016 by FBI agent Pete Strzok.` - Nunes Memo [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20180921061353/https://intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/memo_and_white_house_letter.pdf)
    
- On 24 January 2018, Assistant Attorney General Steven Boyd sent a letter to the HPSCI.
    
    - `In addition, we have also heard that HPSCI is considering making the classified memorandum available to the public and the media, an unprecedented action. We believe it would be extraordinarily reckless for the Committee to disclose such information publicly without giving the Department and the FBI the opportunity to review the memorandum and to advise the HPSCI of the risk of harm to national security and to ongoing investigations that could come from public release. Indeed, we do not understand why the Committee would possibly seek to disclose classified and law enforcement sensitive information without first consulting with the relevant members of the Intelligence Community.` [link](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/4359834/DOJ-Letter-to-Nunes.pdf)
    
- On 24 January 2018, The FBI released a statement on the Nunes Memo mentioning grave concerns of material ommissions.
    
    - `The FBI takes seriously its obligations to the FISA Court and its compliance with procedures overseen by career professionals in the Department of Justice and the FBI. We are committed to working with the appropriate oversight entities to ensure the continuing integrity of the FISA process.  
    -   
    - With regard to the House Intelligence Committee’s memorandum, the FBI was provided a limited opportunity to review this memo the day before the committee voted to release it. As expressed during our initial review, we have grave concerns about material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo’s accuracy.`  
    - [link](https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/fbi-statement-on-hpsci-memo)
    
- On 29 January 2018, Adam Schiff, Ranking Member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence released a memorandum that detailed disagreements with the Nunes Memo.
    
    - `The HPSCI Majority's move to release to the House of Representatives its allegations against the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) is a transparent effort to undermine those agencies, the Special Counsel, and Congress' investigations. It also risks public exposure of sensitive sources and methods for no legitimate purpose.  
    -   
    - FBI and DOJ officials did "abuse" the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) process, omit material information, or subvert this vital tool to spy on the Trump campaign.  
    -   
    - In fact, DOJ and the FBI would have been remiss in their duty to protect the country had they not sought a FISA warrant and repeated renewals to conduct temporary surveillance of Carter Page, someone the FBI assessed to be an agent of the Russian government. DOJ met the rigor. transparency. and evidentiary basis needed to meet FISA's probable cause requirement, by demonstrating:  
    -   
    - contemporaneous evidence of Russia's election interference;  
    - concerning Russian links and outreach to Trump campaign officials;  
    - Page's history with Russian intelligence; and  
    - [REDACTED] Page's suspicious activities in 2016, including in Moscow.  
    -   
    - The Committee's Minority has therefore prepared this memorandum to correct the record:  
    -   
    - Christopher Steele's raw intelligence reporting did not inform the FBI's decision to initiate its counterintelligence investigation in late July 2016. In fact, the FBI's closely-held investigative team only received Steele's reporting in mid-September— more than seven weeks later. The FBI — and, subsequently, the Special Counsel's — investigation into links between the Russian government and Trump campaign associates has been based on troubling law enforcement and intelligence information unrelated to the "dossier."  
    -   
    - DOJ's October 21, 2016 FISA application and three subsequent renewals carefully outlined for the Court a multi-pronged rationale for surveilling Page, who, at the time of the first application, was no longer with the Trump campaign.

### Barr Letter
- On 24 March 2019, Barr sent a letter to leaders of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees detailing the purported "principal conclusions" of the Mueller report. The letter included some brief fragments from the Mueller report, but when the document is public, his selections came under scrutiny.
    
    - `In making this determination, we noted that the special counsel recognized that ‘the evidence does not establish that the president was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference,’ and that, while not determinative, the absence of such evidence bears upon the president’s intent with respect to obstruction.` - Barr Letter [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20190401160320/https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/democrats.judiciary.house.gov/files/documents/AG%20March%2024%202019%20Letter%20to%20House%20and%20Senate%20Judiciary%20Committees.pdf)
    - 
    - > `Obstruction of justice can be motivated by a desire to protect noncriminal personal interests, to protect against investigations where underlying criminal liability falls into a gray area, or to avoid personal embarrassment. The injury to the integrity of the justice system is the same regardless of whether a person committed an underlying wrong. In this investigation, the evidence does not establish that the president was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference. But the evidence does point to a range of other possible personal motives animating the president’s conduct. These include concerns that continued investigation would call into question the legitimacy of his election and potential uncertainty about whether certain events — such as advance notice of WikiLeaks’ release of hacked information or the June 9, 2016, meeting between senior campaign officials and Russians could be seen as criminal activity by the president, his campaign or his family.` - Mueller Report [link](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download)
    
    - `The special counsel’s investigation did not find that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with Russia in its efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election. As the report states: ‘[T]he investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.’` - Barr Letter [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20190401160320/https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/democrats.judiciary.house.gov/files/documents/AG%20March%2024%202019%20Letter%20to%20House%20and%20Senate%20Judiciary%20Committees.pdf)
    - 
    - > `The investigation also identified numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign. Although the investigation established that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome, and that the campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts, the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.` - Mueller Report [link](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download)
    
    - `In assessing potential conspiracy charges, the special counsel also considered whether members of the Trump campaign ‘coordinated’ with Russian election interference activities. The special counsel defined ‘coordination’ as an ‘agreement — tacit or express — between the Trump campaign and the Russian government on election interference.’` - Barr Letter [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20190401160320/https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/democrats.judiciary.house.gov/files/documents/AG%20March%2024%202019%20Letter%20to%20House%20and%20Senate%20Judiciary%20Committees.pdf)
    - 
    - > `We understood coordination to require an agreement — tacit or express — between the Trump campaign and the Russian government on election interference. That requires more than the two parties taking actions that were informed by or responsive to the other’s actions or interests.` - Mueller Report [link](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download)
    
    - `After making a ‘thorough factual investigation’ into these matters, the special counsel considered whether to evaluate the conduct under department standards governing prosecution and declination decisions but ultimately determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment.` - Barr Letter [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20190401160320/https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/democrats.judiciary.house.gov/files/documents/AG%20March%2024%202019%20Letter%20to%20House%20and%20Senate%20Judiciary%20Committees.pdf)
    - 
    - > `Second, while the O.L.C. opinion concludes that a sitting president may not be prosecuted, it recognizes that a criminal investigation during the president’s term is permissible. The O.L.C. opinion also recognizes that a president does not have immunity after he leaves office. And if individuals other than the president committed an obstruction offense, they may be prosecuted at this time. Given those considerations, the facts known to us, and the strong public interest in safeguarding the integrity of the criminal justice system, we conducted a thorough factual investigation in order to preserve the evidence when memories were fresh and documentary materials were available.` - Mueller Report [link](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download)
    
    - `The special counsel therefore did not draw a conclusion — one way or the other — as to whether the examined conduct constituted obstruction. Instead, for each of the relevant actions investigated, the report sets out evidence on both sides of the question and leaves unresolved what the special counsel views as ‘difficult issues’ of law and fact concerning whether the president’s actions and intent could be viewed as obstruction. The special counsel states that ‘while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.’` - Barr Letter [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20190401160320/https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/democrats.judiciary.house.gov/files/documents/AG%20March%2024%202019%20Letter%20to%20House%20and%20Senate%20Judiciary%20Committees.pdf)
    - 
    - > `Fourth, if we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the president clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state. Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, however, we are unable to reach that judgment. The evidence we obtained about the president’s actions and intent presents difficult issues that prevent us from conclusively determining that no criminal conduct occurred. Accordingly, while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.` - Mueller Report [link](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download)
    - 
    - > `Because we determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment, we did not draw ultimate conclusions about the president’s conduct. The evidence we obtained about the president’s actions and intent presents difficult issues that would need to be resolved if we were making a traditional prosecutorial judgment. At the same time, if we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the president clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state. Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, we are unable to reach that judgment. Accordingly, while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.` - Mueller Report [link](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download)
    
- On 27 March 2019, Mueller sent a letter to Barr detailing criticism of Barr’s letter saying there was now public confusion about Mueller’s investigation.
    
    - `As we stated in our meeting of March 5 and reiterated to the Department early in the afternoon of March 24, the introductions and executive summaries of our two-volume report accurately summarize this Office’s work and conclusions. The summary letter the Department sent to Congress and released to the public late in the afternoon of March 24 did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance of this Office’s work and conclusions. We communicated that concern to the Department on the morning of March 25. There is now public confusion about critical aspects of the results of our investigation. This threatens to undermine a central purpose for which the Department appointed the Special Counsel: to assure full public confidence in the outcome of the investigations. See Department of Justice, Press Release (May 17, 2017).  
    -   
    - While we understand that the Department is reviewing the full report to determine what is appropriate for public release—a process that our Office is working with you to complete—that process need not delay release of the enclosed materials. Release at this time would alleviate the misunderstandings that have arisen and would answer congressional and public questions about the nature and outcome of our investigation. It would also accord with the standard for public release of notifications to Congress cited in your letter.` - Mueller's Letter

### Inditing of a Sitting President
- On 24 September 1973, The Office of Legal Counsel wrote a memo advising the then-Assistant Attorney General Robert Dixon, on the question of `Amenability of the President, Vice President and other Civil Officers to Federal Criminal Prosecution while in Office`.
    
    - `In sum, an interpretation of the Constitution which requires the completion of impeachment proceedings before a criminal prosecution can be instituted would enable persons who are or were employed by the Government to raise a number of extremely technical and complex defenses. It also would pressure Congress to conduct a large number of impeachment proceedings which would weigh heavily on its limited time. Such an interpretation of the Constitution is prima facie erroneous.` - 1973 OLC Memo [link](https://irp.fas.org/agency/doj/olc/092473.pdf)
    
- On 13 May 1998, The Office of Legal Counsel wrote a memo advising the then-Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, on the question of `whether a sitting President is subject to indictment`.
    
    - `These factors all buttress and lead to the same conclusion: it is proper, constitutional, and legal for a federal grand jury to indict a sitting President for serious criminal acts that are not part of, and are contrary to, the President's official duties. In this country, no one, even President Clinton, is above the law.  
    -   
    - This conclusion does not imply that a President must be required to serve an actual prison term before he leaves office. 'The defendant President could remain free pending his trial and the trial court could defer any prison sentence until he leaves  
    - office. The defendant-President may petition the courts to exercise its discretion in appropriate cases. It is one thing for the to petition the court to exercise its discretion; it is quite another for the President to announce that he is above the law and immune from criminal prosecution.` - 1998 OLC Memo  
    - [link](https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/savage-nyt-foia-starr-memo-presidential/ac9e49a727223de2/full.pdf)
    
- On 16 October 2000, The Office of Legal Counsel wrote a memo advising the then-Assistant Attorney General Randolph Moss, on the question of `A Sitting President's Amenability to Indictment and Criminal Prosecution`.
    
    - `The indictment or criminal prosecution of a sitting President would impermissibly undermine the capacity of the executive branch to perform its constitutionally assigned functions` - 2000 OLC Memo [link](https://www.justice.gov/d9/olc/opinions/2000/10/31/op-olc-v024-p0222_0.pdf)
    
- On 18 April 2019, Mueller confirmed that no traditional prosecutorial judgment was to be made in regards to Trump Obstructing Justice, using The DOJ Justice Manual and the 2000 OLC Memo as reason not to.
    
    - `First, a traditional prosecution or declination decision entails a binary determination to initiate or decline a prosecution, but we determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment. The Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) has issued an opinion finding that “the indictment or criminal prosecution of a sitting President would impermissibly undermine the capacity of the executive branch to perform its constitutionally assigned functions” in violation of the constitutional separation of powers.” Given the role of the Special Counsel as an attorney in the Department of Justice and the framework of the Special Counsel regulations, see 28 U.S.C. § 515; 28 C.F.R. § 600.7(a), this Office accepted OLC’s legal conclusion for the purpose of exercising prosecutorial jurisdiction. And apart from OLC’s constitutional view, we recognized that a federal criminal accusation against a sitting President would place burdens on the President’s capacity to govern and potentially preempt constitutional processes for addressing presidential misconduct.  
    -   
    - Second, while the OLC opinion concludes that a sitting President may not be prosecuted, it recognizes that a criminal investigation during the President’s term is permissible. The OLC opinion also recognizes that a President does not have immunity after he leaves office. And if individuals other than the President committed an obstruction offense, they may be prosecuted at this time. Given those considerations, the facts known to us, and the strong public interest in safeguarding the integrity of the criminal justice system, we conducted a thorough factual investigation in order to preserve the evidence when memories were fresh and documentary materials were available.  
    -   
    - Third, we considered whether to evaluate the conduct we investigated under the Justice Manual standards governing prosecution and declination decisions, but we determined not to apply an approach that could potentially result in a judgment that the President committed crimes. The threshold step under the Justice Manual standards is to assess whether a person’s conduct “constitutes a federal offense.” U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Justice Manual § 9-27.220(2018) (Justice Manual). Fairness concerns counseled against potentially reaching that judgment when no charges can be brought. The ordinary means for an individual to respond to an accusation is through a speedy and public trial, with all the procedural protections that surround a criminal case. An individual who believes he was wrongly accused can use that process to seek to clear his name. In contrast, a prosecutor’s judgment that crimes were committed, but that no charges will be brought, affords no such adversarial opportunity for public name-clearing before an impartial adjudicator.` - Mueller Report

### `Internet Research Agency` Criminal Inditements
- On 16 February 2018, Yevgeny Prigozhin, the Internet Research Agency, Concord Management, and other connected Russian individuals were indicted by a US grand jury. He was charged with funding and organizing operations for the purpose of interference with the U.S. political and electoral processes, including the 2016 presidential election, and other crimes including identity theft.
    
    - `Defendant INTERNET RESEARCH AGENCY LLC (“ORGANIZATION”) is a Russian organization engaged in operations to interfere with elections and political processes. Defendants MIKHAIL IVANOVICH BYSTROV, MIKHAIL LEONIDOVICH BURCHIK, ALEKSANDRA YURYEVNA KRYLOVA, ANNA VLADISLAVOVNA BOGACHEVA, SERGEY PAVLOVICH POLOZOV, MARIA ANATOLYEVNA BOVDA, ROBERT SERGEYEVICH BOVDA, DZHEYKHUN NASIMI OGLY ASLANOV, VADIM VLADIMIROVICH PODKOPAEV, GLEB IGOREVICH VASILCHENKO, IRINA VIKTOROVNA KAVERZINA, and VLADIMIR VENKOV worked in various capacities to carry out Defendant ORGANIZATION’s interference operations targeting the United States. From in or around 2014 to the present, Defendants knowingly and intentionally conspired with each other (and with persons known and unknown to the Grand Jury) to defraud the United States by impairing, obstructing, and defeating the lawful functions of the government through fraud and deceit for the purpose of interfering with the U.S. political and electoral processes, including the presidential election of 2016.` [link](https://www.justice.gov/file/1035477/download)

    - `Russian businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin said on Monday he had interfered in U.S. elections and would continue doing so in future, the first such admission from a figure implicated by Washington in efforts to influence American politics.  
    -   
    - In comments posted by the press service of his Concord catering firm on Russia's Facebook equivalent VKontakte, Prigozhin said: "We have interfered (in U.S. elections), we are interfering and we will continue to interfere. Carefully, accurately, surgically and in our own way, as we know how to do."  
    -   
    - The remark by the close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin was posted on the eve of the U.S. midterm elections in response to a request for comment from a Russian news site.`

- On 14 February 2023, Prigozhin stated that he founded the Internet Research Agency to interfere in U.S. elections.
    
    - `Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of the Russian private military company Wagner, admitted on Tuesday to founding the Internet Research Agency (IRA), a notorious troll farm that the US government has sanctioned for interfering in American elections.  
    -   
    - A Wagner Telegram channel on Tuesday published a statement from Prigozhin, asking him to react to the suggestion that he was the founder of the agency.  
    -   
    - I react with pleasure," Prigozhin said in the statement. "I've never just been the financier of the Internet Research Agency. I invented it, I created it, I managed it for a long time. It was founded to protect the Russian information space from boorish aggressive propaganda of anti-Russian narrative from the West."`

### Inspector General Report on the Crossfire Hurricane Investigation
- On 28 March 2018, Department of Justice Inspector General Michael Horowitz announced that his office would initiate a review of the Crossfire Hurricane investigation.
    
    - `Department of Justice (DOJ) Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz announced today that, in response to requests from the Attorney General and Members of Congress, the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) will initiate a review that will examine the Justice Department’s and the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) compliance with legal requirements, and with applicable DOJ and FBI policies and procedures, in applications filed with the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) relating to a certain U.S. person. As part of this examination, the OIG also will review information that was known to the DOJ and the FBI at the time the applications were filed from or about an alleged FBI confidential source. Additionally, the OIG will review the DOJ’s and FBI’s relationship and communications with the alleged source as they relate to the FISC applications.  
    -   
    - If circumstances warrant, the OIG will consider including other issues that may arise during the course of the review.`  
    - [link](https://oig.justice.gov/press/2018/2018-03-28b.pdf)
    
- On 9 December 2019, the Office of the Inspector General, released a redacted report by Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz called `Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation` [link](https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf)
- On 9 December 2019, U.S. Attorney John Durham, who conducted the [[United States Contents Page]] at the behest of Barr, disagreed with the report's findings.
    
    - `In a statement, Attorney General William P. Barr disagreed with one of the inspector general’s key conclusions, saying the FBI launched an investigation of a presidential campaign “on the thinnest of suspicions that, in my view, were insufficient to justify the steps taken. It is also clear that, from its inception, the evidence produced by the investigation was consistently exculpatory.”  
    -   
    - So, too, did Connecticut U.S. Attorney John Durham, whom Barr handpicked to conduct an investigation similar to that of Horowitz. “Our investigation has included developing information from other persons and entities, both in the U.S. and outside of the U.S.,” Durham said in a statement. “Based on the evidence collected to date, and while our investigation is ongoing, last month we advised the Inspector General that we do not agree with some of the report’s conclusions as to predication and how the FBI case was opened.”`

### Origins of Crossfire Hurricane
- The FBI’s decision to open the Crossfire Hurricane investigation was unanimous amongst major leaders of the FBI including Comey, McCabe and ultimately Priestap, that the Australian diplomats information regarding Papadopoulos was a tipping point in total with prior information the FBI had.
    
    - `McCabe told us that he recalled discussing the FFG information with Priestap, Strzok, then Special Counsel to the Deputy Director Lisa Page, and Comey, sometime before Crossfire Hurricane was opened, and he agreed with opening a counterintelligence investigation based on the FFG information. He told us the decision to open the case was unanimous. McCabe said the FBI viewed the FFG information in the context of Russian attempts to interfere with the 2016 U.S. elections in the years and months prior, as well as the FBI's ongoing investigation into the DNC hack by a Russian Intelligence Service (RIS). He also said that when the FBI received the FFG information it was a "tipping point" in terms of opening a counterintelligence investigation regarding Russia's attempts to influence and interfere with the 2016 U.S. elections because not only was there information that Russia was targeting U.S. political institutions, but now the FBI had received an allegation from a trusted partner that there had been some sort of contact between the Russians and the Trump campaign.` - Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation [link](https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf)
    
    - `From July 28 to July 31, officials at FBI Headquarters discussed the FFG information and whether it warranted opening a counterintelligence investigation. The Assistant Director (AD) for CD, E.W. "Bill" Priestap, was a central figure in these discussions. According to Priestap, he discussed the matter with then Section Chief of CD's Counterespionage Section Peter Strzok, as well as the Section Chief of CD's Counterintelligence Analysis Section I (Intel Section Chief); and with representatives of the FBI's Office of the General Counsel (OGC), including Deputy General Counsel Trisha Anderson and a unit chief (OGC Unit Chief) in OGC's National Security and Cyber Law Branch (NSCLB). Priestap told us that he also discussed the matter with either then Deputy Director (DD) Andrew McCabe or then Executive Assistant Director (EAD) Michael Steinbach, but did not recall discussing the matter with then Director James Comey told the OIG that he did not recall being briefed on the FFG information until after the Crossfire Hurricane investigation was opened, and that he was not involved in the decision to open the case` - Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation [link](https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf)
    
    - `According to Priestap, he authorized opening the Crossfire Hurricane counterintelligence investigation on July 31, 2016, based upon these discussions. He told us that the FFG information was provided by a trusted source-the FFG-and he therefore felt it "wise to open an investigation to look into" whether someone associated with the Trump campaign may have accepted the reported offer from the Russians. Priestap also told us that the combination of the FFG information and the FBI's ongoing cyber intrusion investigation of the DNC hacks created a counterintelligence concern that the FBI was "obligated" to investigate. Priestap said that he did not recall any disagreement about the decision to open Crossfire Hurricane, and told us that he was not pressured to open the case.` - Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation [link](https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf)
    
- Horowitz concluded that the FBI had sufficient reason to open the Crossfire Hurricane Investigation in regards to both DOJ policy and Constitutional Law via the Supreme Court.
    
    - `the factual predication required to open a Full Investigation under the Attorney General's Guidelines for Domestic Operations (AG Guidelines) and the FBI's Domestic Investigations and Operations Guide (DIOG) is an "articulable factual basis" that reasonably indicates that one of several circumstances exist:  
    -   
    - An activity constituting a federal crime or a threat to the national security has or may have occurred, is or may be occurring, or will or may occur and the investigation may obtain information relating to the activity or the involvement or role of an individual, group, or organization in such activity;  
    -   
    - An individual, group, organization, entity, information, property, or activity is or may be a target of attack, victimization, acquisition, infiltration, or recruitment in connection with criminal activity in violation of federal law or a threat to the national security and the investigation may obtain information that would help to protect against such activity or threat; or  
    -   
    - The investigation may obtain foreign intelligence that is responsive to a requirement that the FBI collect positive foreign intelligence ie., information relating to the capabilities, intentions, or activities of foreign governments or elements thereof, foreign organizations or foreign persons, or international terrorists.` - Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation  
    - [link](https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf)
    
    - `In addition to requiring an authorized purpose, Department and FBI policy also mandate that each case have adequate factual predication before being initiated. The predication requirement is not a legal requirement but rather a prudential one imposed by Department and FBI policy. For example, the Supreme Court has held that the Department and FBI can lawfully open a federal criminal grand jury investigation even in the absence of predication. See United States v. Morton Salt, 338 U.S. 632, 642-43 (1950) (a grand jury "can investigate merely on suspicion that the law is being violated, or even just because it wants assurance that it is not"); see also United States v. R. Enterprises, 498 U.S. 292, 297 (1991).` - Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation [link](https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf)
    
    - `We similarly concluded that the FBI had sufficient predication to open full counterintelligence investigations of Papadopoulos, Page, Flynn, and Manafort in August 2016. The investigation of Papadopoulos was predicated upon his alleged statements in May 2016 to an employee of the FFG. According to the opening EC, Papadopoulos was "identical to the individual who made statements indicating that he is knowledgeable that the Russians made a suggestion to the Trump team that they could assist the Trump campaign with an anonymous release of information during the campaign that would be damaging to the Clinton campaign." The three other cases were predicated on information developed by the Crossfire Hurricane team through law enforcement database and open source searches, conducted to determine which individuals associated with the Trump campaign may have been in a position to have received the alleged offer of assistance from Russia. As described in Chapter Three, through these efforts, the Crossfire Hurricane team identified three individuals-Page, Manafort, and Flynn-associated with the Trump campaign with either ties to Russia or a history of travel to Russia, two of whom (Page and Manafort) were already the subjects of open FBI investigations pertaining to, in part, their Russia-related activities. The FBI determined that this information, taken together with the information from the FFG indicating Russia had made a suggestion to the Trump team that it could assist by releasing information damaging to candidate Clinton, stated an articulable factual basis reasonably indicating activity may be occurring that may constitute a federal crime or a threat to national security. As with the opening of Crossfire Hurricane, we concluded that the quantum of information articulated by the FBI to open these individual investigations was sufficient to satisfy the low threshold established by Department and FBI predication policy, particularly in the context of the FBI's separate and ongoing investigative efforts to address Russian interference in 2016 U.S. elections.` - Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation [link](https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf)
    
### FBI’s Evaluation of Steele’s Reporting Before First Carter Page FISA Application
- On 5 July 2016, Steele’s reporting was handed over to the Steele’s FBI Handling Agent and expressed concern that if Trump was to become president that it was concerning if Trump was compromised by Russians.
    
    - `Shortly before the Fourth of July 2016, Handling Agent 1 told the OIG that he received a call from Steele requesting an in-person meeting as soon as possible. Handling Agent 1 said he departed his duty station in Europe on July 5 and met with Steele in Steele's office that day. During their meeting, Steele provided Handling Agent 1 with a copy of Report 80 and explained that he had been hired by Fusion GPS to collect information on the relationship between candidate Trump's businesses and Russia. Handling Agent 1 said Steele had become concerned about the possibility of the Russians compromising Trump in the event Trump became President. According to Handling Agent 1, Steele informed him that Fusion GPS had been hired by a law firm to conduct research, though Steele stated that he did not know the law firm's name or its political affiliation. Handling Agent 1 told the OIG, however, that he did not have to ask Steele to know that the request for the research was politically motivated as the connection to politics was obvious to Handling Agent 1 from the circumstances. Handling Agent 1 also told us that he asked Steele to try to identify the law firm. However, Handling Agent 1 said that he did not "continually ask" Steele about the firm's identity as his work with Steele progressed. When asked by the OIG about an October 2016 email from a member of the Crossfire Hurricane team stating that Handling Agent 1 had avoided tasking Steele to obtain the name of the law firm, Handling Agent 1 told us that information was incorrect and that he would never avoid asking a material question. When we asked the email's author about the email, he stated that it accurately represented what Handling Agent 1 had told him during a telephone call in October 2016.` - Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation [link](https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf)
    
- In Late July 2016, Steele was likely aware that the ultimate recipient of the Trump intel was for the DNC.
    
    - `We asked Steele when he learned who had retained Fusion GPS to obtain information concerning Trump and the Trump campaign. He told us he could not recall when he first learned that it was the law firm Perkins Cole and the Democratic National Committee (DNC), though he was certain that it was not at the outset of the engagement with Fusion GPS. Steele further stated that, by late July 2016, Steele had met with Simpson and an attorney from Perkins Cole, which represented the DNC, and Steele said that by that time he was aware of the DNC's role. He stated that he could not remember whether he provided Perkins Cole's name to the FBI but believed it was probable that he did so, but not in July 2016.` - Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation [link](https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf)
    
- On 28 July 2016, The FBI receives Steele's reports 80 and 94 via Steele's Handling Agent.
    
    - `On July 28, 2016, three days prior to the opening of the Crossfire Hurricane investigation, Handling Agent 1 sent Reports 80 and 94 to ASAC 1 in NYFO, who forwarded them to SAC 1. Handling Agent 1 's sharing of the reports with ASAC 1 resulted in a meeting in NYFO on August 3 among ASAC 1, the Chief Division Counsel (CDC), an Associate Division Counsel (ADC), and a Supervisory Special Agent (SSA). Notes taken by the ADC show that the meeting participants discussed in general terms the information contained in Reports 80 and 94 and the relationship between Steele, Simpson, and a "law firm."` - Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation [link](https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf)
    
- On 25 August 2016, The Crossfire Hurricane team requests intelligence information potentially relevant to the investigation.
    
    - `On August 25, 2016, according to a Supervisory Special Agent 1 (SSA 1) who was assigned to the Crossfire Hurricane investigation, during a briefing for then Deputy Director Andrew McCabe on the investigation, McCabe asked SSA 1 to contact NYFO about information that potentially could assist the Crossfire Hurricane investigation. SSA 1 said he reached out to counterintelligence agents and analysts in NYFO within approximately 24 hours following the meeting. Instant messages show that on September 1, SSA 1 spoke with a NYFO counterintelligence supervisor, and that the counterintelligence supervisor was attempting to set up a call between SSA 1 and the ADC.` - Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation [link](https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf)
    
- On 2 September 2016, Steele's Handling Agent inquires where to send the Steele's reports.
    
    - `On September 2, 2016, Handling Agent 1, who had been waiting for NYFO to inform him where to forward Steele's reports, sent the following email to the ADC and counterintelligence supervisor: "Do we have a name yet? The stuff is burning a hole." The ADC responded the same day explaining that SSA 1 had created an electronic sub-file for Handling Agent 1 in the Crossfire Hurricane case and that he should forward the Steele reports to it. However, SSA 1 told us that there was a problem with his attempt to send an email to Handling Agent 1 in early September. SSA 1 said he did not recognize the problem until September 13 and emailed Handling Agent 1 that day with the case information necessary to upload the reports.` - Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation [link](https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf)
    
- On 19 September 2016, The Crossfire Hurricane team receives Steele's reports 80, 94, 95, 100, 101 and 102.
    
    - `On September 19, 2016, the Crossfire Hurricane team received the Steele reporting for the first time when Handling Agent 1 emailed SSA 1 six reports for SSA 1 to upload himself to the sub-file: Reports 80 and 94, and four additional reports (Reports 95, 100, 101, and 102) that Handling Agent 1 had since received from Steele. 226 FBI officials we interviewed told us that the length of time it took for Steele's election reporting to reach FBI Headquarters was excessive and that the reports should have been sent promptly after their receipt by the Legat. Members of the Crossfire Hurricane team told us that their assessment of the Steele election reporting could have started much earlier if the reporting had been made available to them.` - Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation [link](https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf)
    
### First Carter Page FISA Application
- On 19-21 September 2016, The Crossfire Hurricane team begin the first discussions of a FISA application based on the receipt of the Steele Reporting on Carter Page and are noted as the line of establishing probable cause was crossed based on the Steele Reporting.
    
    - `Also on September 19, the team began discussions with OGC to consider Steele's reporting as part of a FISA application targeting Carter Page. In an email to the OGC Unit Chief and OGC Attorney, the Supervisory Intelligence Analyst (Supervisory Intel Analyst) forwarded an excerpt from Steele's Report 94 ( described in more detail below) concerning Page's alleged secret meeting with Igor Divyekin in July 2016 and asked, "Does this put us at least _that_ much closer to a full FISA on [Carter Page]?" (Emphasis in original). The Supervisory Intel Analyst told us that, earlier that day, he had researched information on Divyekin that "elevated" the significance of this particular allegation. He said that he wondered whether OGC would find that this information, along with the totality of the other information on Carter Page, brought them closer to probable cause on Page. Similarly, Case Agent 1 told us that the team's receipt of the reporting from Steele supplied missing information in terms of what Page may have been doing during his July 2016 visit to Moscow and provided enough information on Page's recent activities that Case Agent 1 thought would satisfy OI.  
    -   
    - Two days later, on September 21, the OGC Attorney and OGC Unit Chief requested a meeting with the OI Unit Chief to discuss, among other things, a potential FISA application targeting Carter Page. The OGC Unit Chief told the OIG that the receipt of the Steele reporting changed her mind on whether they could establish probable cause. She said that although there could be differing opinions, she thought it was a "close call" when they first discussed a FISA targeting Page in August, and that the Steele reporting in September "pushed it over" the line in terms of establishing probable cause. She explained that the Steele reporting presented information that Page had recent contact with the Russians and that this contact was consistent with the information received from the FFG that someone on the campaign had received an offer or suggestion of assistance from the Russians. She said that before the Steele reporting, the FBI did not have information concerning what Page's current activities with the Russians might have been or information suggesting a connection between Page and the FFG information. Similarly, the OGC Attorney told us that he thought probable cause was "probably 50/50" before the Steele reporting; however, in his view, it was a combination of the Steele reporting, Carter Page's historical contacts with Russian intelligence officers, and statements Page made in October 2016 during a consensually monitored meeting with an FBI CHS ( described later in this chapter and in Chapter Ten) just before the FISA application was filed with the court, that made the OGC Attorney comfortable about establishing probable cause.  
    -   
    - On September 21, the OGC attorneys met with the OI Unit Chief and described the reporting from Steele concerning Carter Page that the team had recently received. According to notes of the meeting, the OGC Attorney and OGC Unit Chief told the OI Unit Chief about the allegations contained in the Steele reporting that Page had a secret meeting with a high-level Russian official in July 2016, that Page may have received a Russian dossier on Hillary Clinton, and that there was a "well-developed conspiracy" between associates of the Trump campaign and Russian leadership being managed, in part, by Carter Page. The OI Unit Chief told us that he recalled that the Steele reporting was "what kind of pushed it over the line" in terms of the FBI being ready to pursue FISA authority targeting Page. He recalled thinking that if the information bears out during the drafting process, there would probably be sufficient information to support a FISA application targeting Page. Conversely, he said that without the Steele reporting concerning Page, he would not have thought they could establish probable cause based on the other information the FBI presented at that time (Page's historical contacts with Russia).` - Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation

- On 22 September 2016, a Office of Intelligence Attorney is assigned and receives the first FISA request form.
    
    - `On September 22, the OI Unit Chief assigned a line attorney (OI Attorney) to work on the Carter Page FISA, and he and the OI Attorney met with the OGC Unit Chief to brief the OI Attorney into the case and discuss the essential points for the FISA. The same day, OGC submitted a FISA request form to OI providing, among other things, a description of the factual information to establish probable cause to believe that Carter Page was an agent of a foreign power, the "facilities" to be targeted under the proposed FISA coverage, and the FBI's investigative plan. Case Agent 1 said he prepared the FISA request form, and the OGC Attorney said he may have provided a "very quick review" before sending it to OI. The OGC Attorney told us that the FISA request form was not as "robust" as it could have been because the FBI wanted to submit it to OI as soon as possible.` - Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation [link](https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf)
    
    - `Following receipt of the FISA request form on September 22, the OI Attorney immediately began work on the FISA application, preparing the initial drafts with information provided by the FBI. The preparation and approval process for the application took four weeks to complete. We were told that the application received more attention and scrutiny than the typical FISA application in terms of additional layers of review and the number of high-level officials who read the application. We describe this process in detail below.` - Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation [link](https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf)
    
- On 23 September 2016, a Office of Intelligence Attorney begins making warrant drafts.
    
    - `On or about September 23, the OI Attorney began work on the initial draft FISA application. At this early stage of the drafting process, Evans told us that he instructed the OI Attorney and OI Unit Chief to handle the Carter Page FISA application as they would any other FISA application-to make sure the work was as thorough as possible so that NSD could answer the legal question of whether the facts meet the probable cause standard-and leave any policy questions to the decision makers down the road.` - Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation [link](https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf)
    
- On 12 October 2016, Heads of the Crossfire Hurricane team discuss the concern that Steele may have been hired by the DNC and/or Hillary Clinton.
    
    - `On October 12, 2016, Evans's concerns about Steele were briefed to Comey and McCabe in a meeting attended by at least Priestap, Strzok, Lisa Page, and the OGC Unit Chief. According to notes of the meeting, the group discussed that Evans was concerned Steele may have been hired by someone associated with Hillary Clinton or the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and that the read copy of the FISA application would not be filed with the court that day so that Evans could further assess the potential bias. The notes reflect that the group discussed that Evans was also concerned that the foreign intelligence to be collected through the FISA would not be "worth [the] risk." Following the meeting, the OGC Unit Chief emailed Anderson and the OGC Attorney on October 12 and advised them that the concerns Evans had raised were discussed with Comey and McCabe and that both were "supportive" of moving forward despite those concerns.  
    -   
    - During his OIG interview, Evans told us that he thought he did not raise the concern about the potential value of the collection outweighing the risk until sometime after OI worked through the bias issue with the FBI. According to Evans, he raised on multiple occasions with the FBI, including with Strzok, Lisa Page, and later McCabe, whether seeking FISA authority targeting Carter Page was a good idea, even if the legal standard was met. He explained that he did not see a compelling "upside" to the FISA because Carter Page knew he was under FBI investigation (according to news reports) and was therefore not likely to say anything incriminating over the telephone or in email. On the other hand, Evans saw significant "downside" because the target of the FISA was politically sensitive and the Department would be criticized later if this FISA was ever disclosed publicly. He told the OIG that he thought there was no right or wrong answer to this question, which he characterized as a prudential question of risk vs. reward, but he wanted to make sure he raised the issue for the decision makers to consider. According to Evans, the reactions he received from the FBI to this prudential question were some variations of-we understand your concerns, those are valid points, but if you are telling us it's legal, we cannot pull any punches just because there could be criticism afterward.` - Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation  
    - [link](https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf)
    
- On 19 October 2016, Heads of the Crossfire Hurricane team decide to move forward with the FISA application.
    
    - `According to Evans, McCord said that she would discuss the prudential issue with McCabe, but the discussion did not happen before Evans raised the issue directly with McCabe after a regularly scheduled meeting on October 19. According to Evans, McCabe told Evans on October 19 something to the effect of, "I hear you. I understand. [B]ut we can't pull any punches and we've got to do it, and ... let the chips fall where they may." McCabe told us that he did not recall the specific words he used with Evans, but he believed he conveyed to Evans that the FBI "felt strongly" that the FISA application should move forward. McCabe said that he understood at the time that the FBI would likely be criticized no matter what the team did or did not do, but he believed that the team had to get to the bottom of this potentially serious threat to national security. He said that if the FBI had not sought FISA authority under the circumstances presented here simply because the team was afraid of the "political nature" of the information, the FBI would have failed to do its job.` - Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation [link](https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf)
    
- On 20 October 2016, Comey Signs the first FISA warrant on the surveillance of Carter Page.
    
    - `Comey signed the application on October 20, and the application package was presented to Yates on October 21.` - Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation [link](https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf)
    
- On 21 October 2016, The first FISA warrant is approved on the surveillance of Carter Page.
    
    - `At the request of the FBI, the Department filed four applications with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court FISC seeking FISA authority to conduct electronic surveillance targeting Carter Page: the first application on October 21, 2016, and three renewal applications on January 12, April 7, and June 29, 2017. A different FISC judge considered each application and issued the requested orders, collectively resulting in approximately 11 months of FISA coverage targeting Carter Page from October 21, 2016, to September 22, 2017.` - Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation [link](https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf)
    
### FBI’s Activities to Assess Steele’s Reporting After First Carter Page FISA Application
- On 31 October 2016, Mother Jones published an article titled "A Veteran Spy Has Given the FBI Information Alleging a Russian Operation to Cultivate Donald Trump." which included report 80 of the Steele Dossier provided by Steele.
    
    - `At the end of October 2016, Steele provided a briefing to a Mother Jones reporter in which Steele disclosed that he had provided the FBI with information showing connections between candidate Trump and his campaign and the Russian government. On October 31, 2016, three days after then FBI Director James Comey's public announcement that the FBI was reopening its investigation into then Secretary Clinton's use of a private email server based on the receipt of new evidence, Mother Jones published an article titled "A Veteran Spy Has Given the FBI Information Alleging a Russian Operation to Cultivate Donald Trump." The article described the work of a "well-placed Western intelligence source" with a background in Russian intelligence who was sharing information with the FBI. The article presented information contained in Report 80, and quoted the officer as stating that, based on his interactions with the FBI, "[i]t's quite clear there was or is a pretty substantial inquiry going on."` - Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation [link](https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf)
    
    - `He regularly consults with US government agencies on Russian matters, and near the start of July on his own initiative—without the permission of the US company that hired him—he sent a report he had written for that firm to a contact at the FBI, according to the former intelligence officer and his American associates, who asked not to be identified. (He declines to identify the FBI contact.) The former spy says he concluded that the information he had collected on Trump was “sufficiently serious” to share with the FBI.` [link](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/veteran-spy-gave-fbi-info-alleging-russian-operation-cultivate-donald-trump/)
    
- On 1 November 2016, Steele was closed as a confidential human source for the FBI. Strzok told the OIG that this was because of Steele’s decision to discuss his reporting with the media, namely Mother Jones.
    
    - `members of the Crossfire Hurricane team met with Steele in early October, that the decision to close Steele was "non-negotiable."  
    - Handling Agent 1 finalized the necessary paperwork on November 17, 2016, which stated that Steele was closed on November 1 and was being closed for cause due to his disclosure of his confidential relationship with the FBI to a third party. Strzok told the OIG that the FBI closed Steele "because he was a control problem. We did not close him because we thought he was [a] fabricator." According to Strzok, Steele's decisions to discuss his reporting with the media and to disclose his relationship with the FBI were "horrible and it hurt what we were doing, and no question, he shouldn't have done it."  
    -   
    - As a consequence of his closing, Handling Agent 1 halted payment of $15,000 to Steele. Handling Agent 1 told the OIG that the FBI never paid Steele for information related to the 2016 U.S. elections. FBI records show that Steele's last payment occurred on August 12, 2016, and was for information furnished to the FBl's Cyber and Counterintelligence Divisions (CD) that was unrelated to the 2016 U.S. elections.` - Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation

    - `At the request of the FBI, the Department filed four applications with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court FISC seeking FISA authority to conduct electronic surveillance targeting Carter Page: the first application on October 21, 2016, and three renewal applications on January 12, April 7, and June 29, 2017. A different FISC judge considered each application and issued the requested orders, collectively resulting in approximately 11 months of FISA coverage targeting Carter Page from October 21, 2016, to September 22, 2017.` - Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation [link](https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf)

### Errors in Carter Page FISA Renewal Application
- > `` - Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation [link](https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf)
    
- Horowitz concluded that the review did not find evidence that `political bias or improper motivation influenced the FBI's decision to seek FISA authority on Carter Page`.
    
    - `As noted above, in the OIG's June 2018 report, Review of Various Actions in Advance of the 2016 Election, we described text messages between Peter Strzok and Lisa Page discussing statements of hostility toward then candidate Trump and statements of support for candidate Clinton. Several of these text messages appeared to mix political opinions with discussions about the investigation into candidate Clinton's email use and refer to the Crossfire Hurricane investigation. As part of our review of the Carter Page FISA applications, we sought to determine whether there was evidence that Strzok or Page affected the preparation of or decision to file any of the applications. As described in Chapter Five, Strzok approved the request to expedite the FISA application proposed by the Crossfire Hurricane team, and he and Lisa Page communicated with Department officials, as did other FBI officials, in an effort to move the first application forward. This included conversations with NSD officials during which Strzok expressed frustration that the FISA process was not moving forward at the pace desired by the FBI. However, testimonial and documentary evidence we reviewed established that Strzok and Lisa Page played no role in the substantive preparation or approval of any of the four FISA applications, including the Woods process. We did not find documentary or testimonial evidence that political bias or improper motivation influenced the FBI's decision to seek FISA authority on Carter Page.` - Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation [link](https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf)
    
- Horowitz concluded that the review did find 17 `significant inaccuracies and omissions` in the FBI's four FISA applications made to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to obtain warrants for the surveillance of Page.
    
    - `Nevertheless, we found that members of the Crossfire Hurricane team failed to meet the basic obligation to ensure that the Carter Page FISA applications were "scrupulously accurate." We identified significant inaccuracies and omissions in each of the four applications-7 in the first FISA application and a total of 17 by the final renewal application. For example, the Crossfire Hurricane team obtained information from Steele's Primary Sub-source in January 2017 that raised significant questions about the reliability of the Steele reporting that was used in the Carter Page FISA applications. But members of the Crossfire Hurricane team failed to share the information with the Department, and it was therefore omitted from the second and third renewal applications. All of the applications also omitted information the FBI had obtained from another U.S. government agency detailing its prior relationship with Page, including that Page had been approved as an operational contact for the other agency from 2008 to 2013, and that Page had provided information to the other agency concerning his prior contacts with certain Russian intelligence officers, one of which overlapped with facts asserted in the FISA application.  
    -   
    - As a result of the 17 significant inaccuracies and omissions we identified, relevant information was not shared with, and consequently not considered by, important Department decision makers and the court, and the FISA applications made it appear as though the evidence supporting probable cause was stronger than was actually the case. We also found basic, fundamental, and serious errors during the completion of the FBI's factual accuracy reviews, known as the Woods Procedures, which are designed to ensure that FISA applications contain a full and accurate presentation of the facts.` - Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation  
    - [link](https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf)
    
- Horowitz concluded that the review highlighted `serious performance failures` reflected badly on `the FBI chain of command's management and supervision` of the FISA processes.
    
    - `As noted throughout this report, Case Agent 1 was primarily responsible for some of the most significant errors and omissions in the FISA applications, including (1) the mischaracterization of Steele's prior reporting resulting from his failure to seek review and approval of the statement from the handling agent, as the Woods Procedures required, (2) the failure to advise OI of Papadopoulos's statements to FBI CHSs that were inconsistent with the Steele reporting relied upon in the FISA applications that there was a "well-developed conspiracy of cooperation" between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and Russia, (3) the failure to advise OI of Page's statements to an FBI CHS regarding him having no communications with Manafort and denying the alleged meetings with Sechin and Divyekin, ( 4) providing inaccurate and incomplete information to OI about information provided by another U.S. government agency regarding its past relationship with Page that was highly relevant to the applications, (5) the failure to advise OI of the information from Bruce Ohr about Steele and his election reporting, and (6) the failure to advise OI of the inconsistences between Steele and his Primary Sub-source. The explanations that Case Agent 1 provided for these errors and omissions are summarized in Chapter Five and Chapter Eight of this report. While we found no documentary or testimonial evidence that this pattern of errors by Case Agent 1 was intentional, we also did not find his explanations for so many significant and repeated failures to be satisfactory. We therefore concluded that these explanations did not excuse his failure to meet his responsibility to ensure that the initial FISA application, the first renewal application, and the third renewal application were "scrupulously accurate."  
    -   
    - We similarly found errors by supervisory FBI employees with responsibility for the accuracy of the FBI applications. For example, SSA 1 performed the supervisory accuracy review for the first application required under the Woods Procedures and did not correct the errors we identified before the application was filed. We found that the team "speculated" that Steele's prior reporting had been corroborated and used in criminal proceedings, but did not take reasonable steps to ensure the accuracy of this statement and did not confirm that Handling Agent 1 had reviewed and approved its content, as required by the Woods Procedures. Separately, SSA 3 and SSA 5 failed to correct all of the errors we identified in the renewal applications, as did Case Agent 1 and Case Agent 7, when they performed the accuracy review under the Woods Procedures for one or more of the renewals.  
    -   
    - These failures by supervisory and non-supervisory agents represent serious performance failures. 499 However, as we next discuss, the breadth and significance of these and other errors raised broader concerns as well.` - Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation  
    - [link](https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf)
    
    - `These errors and omissions resulted from case agents providing wrong or incomplete information to OI and failing to flag important issues for discussion, without any satisfactory explanations. Moreover, case agents and SSAs did not give equal attention or treatment to the relevant facts that did not support probable cause, or reassess the evidence supporting probable cause as the investigation progressed and the information gathered undercut the assertions in the FISA applications. Further, the agents and SSAs did not follow, or appear to even know, the requirements in the Woods Procedures to re-verify the factual assertions from previous applications that are repeated in renewal applications and verify source characterization statements with the CHS handling agent and document the verification in the Woods File. That so many basic and fundamental errors were made on four FISA applications by three separate, hand-picked teams, on one of the most sensitive FBI investigations that was briefed to the highest levels within the FBI and that FBI officials expected would eventually be subjected to close scrutiny, raised significant questions regarding the FBI chain of command's management and supervision of the FISA process.` - Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation [link](https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf)
    
- Horowitz concluded that the first FISA application had omitted information about Page working for the CIA.
    
    - `Toward that end, on September 28, 2016, the OI Attorney emailed Case Agent 1 a draft of the FISA application, copying other members of the Crossfire Hurricane team. In a comment in the draft application, the OI Attorney asked "do we know if there is any truth to Page's claim that he has provided information to [another U.S. government agency]-was he considered a source/asset/whatever?" In response to the OI Attorney's question, on September 29, Case Agent 1 inserted the following comment in the draft:  
    -   
    - "He did meet with [the other U.S. government agency], however, it's dated and I would argue it was/is outside scope, I don't think we need it in. It was years ago, when he was in Moscow. If you want to keep it, I can get the language from the [August 17 Memorandum] we were provided [by the other U.S. government agency]."  
    -   
    - Based upon this response, the OI Attorney did not include information about Page's prior relationship with the other agency in the FISA application.  
    -   
    - However, the information Case Agent 1 provided to the OI Attorney was inaccurate. As described in the August 17 Memorandum from the other U.S. government agency to the FBI, Page first met with the other agency in April 2008, after he left Moscow (Page had lived in Moscow from 2004 to 2007), and he had been approved as an operational contact for the other agency from 2008 to 2013. Additionally, rather than being outside the scope of the FISA application, the FISA application included allegations about meetings that Page had with Russian intelligence officers that Page had disclosed to the other agency. Specifically, according to the August 17 Memorandum, Page provided information to the other agency in October 2010 about contacts he had with a Russian intelligence officer (Intelligence Officer 1), which the other agency assessed likely began in 2008. Page's contacts with Intelligence Officer 1 in 2007 and 2008 were among the historical connections to Russian intelligence officers that the FBI relied upon in the first FISA application (and subsequent renewal applications) to help support probable cause. The August 17 Memorandum stated that Page told the other agency that he met with Intelligence Officer 1 four times, characterized him as a "compelling, nice guy," and described Intelligence Officer l's alleged interest in contacting an identified U.S. person. According to the August 17 Memorandum, the employee of the other U.S. government agency who met with Page assessed that Page "candidly described his contact with" Intelligence Officer 1. Page's relationship with the other agency was not mentioned in any of the four FISA applications.` - Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation  
    - [link](https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf)
    
    - `On Aug. 17, the CIA advised the FBI in writing that Page had been an “operational contact” from 2008 to 2013, the inspector general found, which meant that the agency could ask Page questions about things he may have learned in the normal course of his activities, but could not assign him to go out and gather information. The report does not identify the agency by name, but it was the CIA, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive issue.  
    -   
    - Page, the agency said, had previously provided information about his contacts with Russian intelligence officers. That was potentially an important fact because if Page had been telling the CIA about those Russian contacts, that might make him seem less suspicious to the FBI.  
    -   
    - The inspector general found no evidence that the Crossfire Hurricane team asked for more information about Page’s relationship with the CIA before asking a court for a surveillance warrant to monitor him.`

### 2018 `Spygate` Conspiracy

- Spygate is a conspiracy theory initiated by Trump in May 2018 that the Obama administration had placed a spy in his 2016 presidential campaign for political purposes.
### 2019 Trump-Ukraine Controversy, 1st Impeachment
- [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump%E2%80%93Ukraine_scandal)
- [[video]](https://youtu.be/BD3my03ioio)
- On 9 May 2019, it was reported that Rudy Giuliani planned a trip to Ukraine to push for inquiries that could help Trump.
    
    - `Mr. Giuliani’s plans create the remarkable scene of a lawyer for the president of the United States pressing a foreign government to pursue investigations that Mr. Trump’s allies hope could help him in his re-election campaign. And it comes after Mr. Trump spent more than half of his term facing questions about whether his 2016 campaign conspired with a foreign power.  
    -   
    - “We’re not meddling in an election, we’re meddling in an investigation, which we have a right to do,” Mr. Giuliani said in an interview on Thursday when asked about the parallel to the special counsel’s inquiry.  
    -   
    - “There’s nothing illegal about it,” he said. “Somebody could say it’s improper. And this isn’t foreign policy — I’m asking them to do an investigation that they’re doing already and that other people are telling them to stop. And I’m going to give them reasons why they shouldn’t stop it because that information will be very, very helpful to my client, and may turn out to be helpful to my government.”  
    -   
    - Mr. Giuliani’s planned trip, which has not been previously reported, is part of a monthslong effort by the former New York mayor and a small group of Trump allies working to build interest in the Ukrainian inquiries. Their motivation is to try to discredit the special counsel’s investigation; undermine the case against Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump’s imprisoned former campaign chairman; and potentially to damage Mr. Biden, the early front-runner for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.`

- On 11 May 2019, Rudy Giuliani cancelled a trip to Ukraine one day after saying he would be, "meddling in an investigation" and giving Ukraine's new government," quote, "reasons why they shouldn't stop it because that information will be "very very helpful to my client,".
    
    - `Facing withering attacks accusing him of seeking foreign assistance for President Trump’s re-election campaign, Rudolph W. Giuliani announced on Friday night that he had canceled a trip to Kiev in which he planned to push the incoming Ukrainian government to press ahead with investigations that he hoped would benefit Mr. Trump.  
    -   
    - Mr. Giuliani, President Trump’s personal lawyer, explained that he felt as if he was being “set up” by Ukrainians critical of his efforts, and he blamed Democrats for trying to “spin” the trip.  
    -   
    - “They say I was meddling in the election — ridiculous — but that’s their spin,” he said.`

### FBIs Attempt To Spy on Clinton Campaign
- The FBI encouraged a Confidential Human Source to infiltrate the Clinton campaign to attempt to entrap Hilary Clinton
    
    - `According to CHS-A, Insider-I, on behalf of Foreign Govemment-3, sought access through CHS-A, to a Clinton campaign fundraising event in the Fall of 2015. Although CHSA was initially advised by an individual associated with the fundraising efforts that Insider-1 could attend, that individual consulted with the campaign and disinvited Insider-1 to the event because of the perceived negative attention a foreign national might attract. According to CHS-A, the fundraising contact suggested CHS-A schedule a separate meeting for Insider-1. Field Office-I renewed the OIA from late 2014 for the CHS to attend the late November 2015 event and make introductions on behalf of Insider-I, but ultimately CHS-A did not attend the event.` - Durham Report [link](https://www.justice.gov/storage/durhamreport.pdf)

### 2020 Election `Fraud` Conspiracy, 2nd Impeachment
[link](https://youtu.be/-QiSWnvrb24?t=2358)
[link](https://www.thetrumparchive.com/)
### Pre-Election
- On 7 April 2020, President Trump first made suggestions to the media that widespread electoral fraud would occur during the 2020 Election especially through the use of mail-in ballots.
    
    - `"Mail ballots — they cheat. OK? People cheat," he said April 7. "There's a lot of dishonesty going along with mail-in voting."`  
    -   
    - ...  
    -   
    - `"Mail ballots are a very dangerous thing for this country, because they're cheaters. They go and collect them. They're fraudulent in many cases,” Trump said April 7.`  
    - [link](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-pushes-false-claims-about-mail-vote-fraud-here-are-n1180566)
    
- On 8 April 2020, President Trump tweeted in response to the Republican silence accusing Democrats of stoking voter fraud
    
    - `Republicans should fight very hard when it comes to state wide mail-in voting. Democrats are clamoring for it. Tremendous potential for voter fraud, and for whatever reason, doesn’t work out well for Republicans. @foxandfriends` [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20200408122052/https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1247861952736526336)
    
- On 8 April 2020, President Trump tweeted about the alleged difference in Absentee Ballots and Mail-In Ballots.
    
    - `Absentee Ballots are a great way to vote for the many senior citizens, military, and others who can’t get to the polls on Election Day. These ballots are very different from 100% Mail-In Voting, which is “RIPE for FRAUD,” and shouldn’t be allowed!` [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20200531223135/https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1248031484532928514)
    
- On 11 April 2020, President Trump tweeted,
    
    - `Mail in ballots substantially increases the risk of crime and VOTER FRAUD!` [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20200902054032/https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1249132374547464193)
    
- On 19 July 2020, Trump refused to say whether he would accept the results of the election and commit to a peaceful transition of power if he lost.
    
    - `In the “Fox News Sunday” interview, Wallace asked Trump whether he considers himself a “gracious” loser. Trump replied that he doesn’t like to lose, then added: “It depends. I think mail-in voting is going to rig the election. I really do.” Trump’s comment echoed unfounded claims he has made in recent weeks that mail-in voting is susceptible to widespread fraud. “Are you suggesting that you might not accept the results of the election?” Wallace asked. Trump responded, “No. I have to see.” Later in the interview, pressed on whether he will accept the results of the November election, Trump again declined to say.` [link](https://archive.ph/CItzx)
    
- On 12 August 2020, the House of Representatives voted for a $25 billion grant to the U.S. Postal Service for the expected surge in mail voting, Trump blocked funding, saying he wanted to prevent any increase in voting by mail.
    
    - `Trump, who has been railing against mail-in balloting for months, said the cash-strapped agency’s enlarged role in the November election would perpetuate “one of the greatest frauds in history.” Speaking Wednesday at his daily pandemic news briefing, Trump said he would not approve $25 billion in emergency funding for the Postal Service, or $3.5 billion in supplemental funding for election resources, citing prohibitively high costs. “They don’t have the money to do the universal mail-in voting. So therefore, they can’t do it, I guess,” Trump said. “Are they going to do it even if they don’t have the money?”` [link](https://archive.ph/Ug1yL)
    
- On 23 September 2020, Trump again refused to say whether he would accept the results of the election and commit to a peaceful transition of power if he lost.
    
    - `"Well, we're going to have to see what happens," Trump said when asked whether he'd commit to a peaceful transition, one of the cornerstones of American democracy.  
    -   
    - ...  
    -   
    - "You know that I've been complaining very strongly about the ballots and the ballots are a disaster," Trump said at a press briefing at the White House,  
    -   
    - ...  
    -   
    - "(G)et rid of the ballots and you'll have a very ... there won't be a transfer, frankly. There'll be a continuation," he added, saying "the ballots are out of control."`

### Peri-Election
- On 3 November 2020, Election Day starts.
- On 4 & 5 November 2020, More than 200 Trump supporters protest at a Maricopa County, Arizona elections center and around downtown Phoenix, claiming some ballots have not been properly counted.
    
    - `Tensions are running high outside of the Maricopa County Elections office in Phoenix, Ariz., where more than a hundred protestors have demonstrated for the last three nights to argue about the electoral process after former Vice President Joe Biden became the front-runner in the traditionally red state.` [link](https://time.com/5908628/maricopa-county-arizona-protests/)
    
- On 5 November 2020, Trump Tweeted:
    
    - `STOP THE COUNT!` [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20201105153104/https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1324353932022480896)

- On 5 November 2020, Trump claimed that the election was being stolen from him.
    
    - `“If you count the legal votes, I easily win. If you count the illegal votes, they can try to steal the election from us. If you count the votes that came in late, we’re looking at them very strongly,” Trump told reporters.  
    -   
    - ...  
    -   
    - “Media polling was election interference, in the truest sense of that word by powerful special interests. These, really, phony polls … were designed to keep our voters at home, create the illusion of momentum for Mr. Biden and diminish republicans ability to raise funds. They were what’s called suppression polls,” Trump said.`

- On 7 November 2020, AP news called the 2020 Election in favour of Joe Biden.
    
    - `On Saturday, Biden captured the presidency when The Associated Press declared him the victor in his native Pennsylvania at 11:25 a.m. EST. That got him the state’s 20 electoral votes, which pushed him over the 270 electoral-vote threshold needed to prevail.` [link](https://apnews.com/article/why-did-AP-call-election-for-Biden-fe79276cd9175fffc7cf4fb58045fcf9)
    
### Post-Election
- On 9 November 2020, The administrator of the General Services Administration refuses to sign a letter allowing Biden's transition team to formally begin work, reflecting Trump's position of not conceding yet.
    
    - `A Trump administration appointee is refusing to sign a letter allowing President-elect Joe Biden’s transition team to formally begin its work this week, in another sign the incumbent president has not acknowledged Biden’s victory and could disrupt the transfer of power.` [link](https://archive.ph/HfGpV)
    
- On 12 November 2020, The Trump-Appointed Commis­sioner of the U.S. Elec­tion Assist­ance Commis­sion, Benjamin Hovland said that,
    
    - `You know, we've seen allegations like this before, and essentially, time and time again, when the rubber hits the road, there's no evidence — whether that's in court cases, whether that's in the presidential commission that was created in 2017 to find the alleged non-citizens fraud after the 2016 election that cost, in his mind, the president the popular vote, but found nothing and disbanded in embarrassment, or academic studies. We never see evidence of widespread voter fraud. And there's no indicators that 2020 will be different in that regard.` [link](https://www.businessinsider.com/nations-chief-election-administrator-calls-trumps-voting-fraud-claims-shameful-2020-11?r=US&IR=T)
    
- On 12 November 2020, The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency released the following statement:
    
    - `“The November 3rd election was the most secure in American history. Right now, across the country, election officials are reviewing and double checking the entire election process prior to finalizing the result. “When states have close elections, many will recount ballots. All of the states with close results in the 2020 presidential race have paper records of each vote, allowing the ability to go back and count each ballot if necessary. This is an added benefit for security and resilience. This process allows for the identification and correction of any mistakes or errors. There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised. “Other security measures like pre-election testing, state certification of voting equipment, and the U.S. Election Assistance Commission’s (EAC) certification of voting equipment help to build additional confidence in the voting systems used in 2020. “While we know there are many unfounded claims and opportunities for misinformation about the process of our elections, we can assure you we have the utmost confidence in the security and integrity of our elections, and you should too. When you have questions, turn to elections officials as trusted voices as they administer elections.”` [link](https://www.cisa.gov/news/2020/11/12/joint-statement-elections-infrastructure-government-coordinating-council-election)
    
- On 11 December 2020, Attorney General William Barr said to AP news that there is no evidence of widespread election fraud that Trump is claiming.
    
    - `Although Justice’s U.S. attorneys and FBI agents had been working to follow up specific complaints they’d received, Barr told Balsamo: “To date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election.” The Dec. 1 statement was a direct contradiction to Trump and his allies who have kept up baseless arguments about a rigged election, despite the electoral college tally and popular vote loss to Democrat Joe Biden.` [link](https://leads.ap.org/best-of-the-week/exclusive-interview-with-attorney-general-barr-nets-massive-scoop)
    
- On 2 January 2021, during an hour-long conference call, Trump pressured Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to change the state's election results citing that Trump wanted to find 11,780 votes.
    
    - `Now the problem is they need more time for the big numbers. But they’re very substantial numbers. But I think you’re going to find that they — by the way, a little information — I think you’re going to find that they are shredding ballots because they have to get rid of the ballots because the ballots are unsigned. The ballots are corrupt, and they’re brand new, and they don’t have seals, and there’s a whole thing with the ballots. But the ballots are corrupt. And you are going to find that they are — which is totally illegal — it is more illegal for you than it is for them because, you know, what they did and you’re not reporting it. That’s a criminal, that’s a criminal offense. And you can’t let that happen. That’s a big risk to you and to Ryan, your lawyer. And that’s a big risk. But they are shredding ballots, in my opinion, based on what I’ve heard. And they are removing machinery, and they’re moving it as fast as they can, both of which are criminal finds. And you can’t let it happen, and you are letting it happen. You know, I mean, I’m notifying you that you’re letting it happen. So look. All I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have because we won the state.` [link](https://archive.ph/BMC7Q)
    
- Trump might have violated Title 52 of the United States Code when he said "I just want to find 11,780 votes” by trying to intimidating election officials to change the results
    
    - `The University of Richmond law professor Carl Tobias said Trump might be “in legal jeopardy after Biden is inaugurated”. In an email to the Guardian, he wrote: “For example, if the justice department or US attorneys believe that Trump violated federal law, or if local prosecutors in states such as Arizona, Georgia, Michigan and Wisconsin, where Trump may have engaged in similar behaviour with state or local election officials, believe that Trump violated state election laws, the federal or state prosecutors could file suit against Trump.” Richard H Pildes, a constitutional law professor at New York University, told the Washington Post: “The president is either knowingly attempting to coerce state officials into corrupting the integrity of the election or is so deluded that he believes what he’s saying.” Trump’s actions may have violated federal statutes, he said. Michael R Bromwich, a former federal prosecutor in the US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, wrote: “Unless there are portions of the tape that somehow negate criminal intent, ‘I just want to find 11,780 votes’ and his threats against Raffensperger and his counsel violate 52 U.S. Code 20511.”` [link](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/04/trumps-phone-call-to-brad-raffensperger-five-key-points)
    
    - 52 U.S. Code 20511 - `A person, including an election official, who in any election for Federal office— (1)knowingly and willfully intimidates, threatens, or coerces, or attempts to intimidate, threaten, or coerce, any person for— (A)registering to vote, or voting, or attempting to register or vote; (B)urging or aiding any person to register to vote, to vote, or to attempt to register or vote; or (C)exercising any right under this chapter; or (2)knowingly and willfully deprives, defrauds, or attempts to deprive or defraud the residents of a State of a fair and impartially conducted election process, by— (A)the procurement or submission of voter registration applications that are known by the person to be materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent under the laws of the State in which the election is held; or (B)the procurement, casting, or tabulation of ballots that are known by the person to be materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent under the laws of the State in which the election is held, shall be fined in accordance with title 18 (which fines shall be paid into the general fund of the Treasury, miscellaneous receipts (pursuant to section 3302 of title 31), notwithstanding any other law), or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both.` [link](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/52/20511)
    
- On 28 January 2021, The Federal Election Commission announced that Biden won the election on November 3 2020, receiving 81,268,924 votes (51.31%) to Trump's 74,216,154 (46.86%) and 306 Electoral College votes to Trump's 232.

### Intelligence Community Report
- On 15 March 2021, The Office of the Director of National Intelligence declassified and released a report on `Foreign Threats to the 2020 US Federal Elections`
    
    - `Throughout the election cycle, Russia's online influence actors sought to affect US public perceptions of the candidates, as well as advance Moscow's longstanding goals of undermining confidence in US election processes and increasing sociopolitical divisions among the American people. During the presidential primaries and dating back to 2019, these actors backed candidates from both major US political parties that Moscow viewed as outsiders, while later claiming that election fraud helped what they called "establishment" candidates. Throughout the election, Russia's online influence actors sought to amplify mistrust in the electoral process by denigrating mail-in ballots, highlighting alleged irregularities, and accusing the Democratic Party of voter fraud.  
    -   
    - The Kremlin-linked influence organization Project Lakhta and its Lakhta Internet Research (LIR) troll farm--commonly referred to by its former moniker Internet Research Agency (IRA)-amplified controversial domestic issues. LIR used social media personas, news websites, and US persons to deliver tailored content to subsets of the US population. LIR established short-lived troll farms that used unwitting third-country nationals in Ghana, Mexico, and Nigeria to propagate these US-focused narratives, probably in response to efforts by US companies and law enforcement to shut down UR-associated personas.  
    -   
    - Russian state media, trolls, and online proxies, including those directed by Russian intelligence, published disparaging content about President Biden, his family, and the Democratic Party, and heavily amplified related content circulating in US media, including stories centered on his son. These influence actors frequently sought out US contributors to increase their reach into US audiences. In addition to election-related content, these online influence actors also promoted conspiratorial narratives about the COVID-19 pandemic, made allegations of social media censorship, and highlighted US divisions surrounding protests about racial justice.  
    -   
    - Russian online influence actors generally promoted former President Trump and his commentary, including repeating his political messaging on the election results; the presidential campaign; debates; the impeachment inquiry; and, as the election neared, US domestic crises. Influence actors sometimes sought to discourage US left-leaning audiences from voting by suggesting that neither candidate was a preferable option. At the same time, Russian actors criticized former President Trump or his administration when they pursued foreign policies-such as the targeted killing of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in January 2020--at odds with Russia's preferences.  
    -   
    - LIR, which probably receives tasking and strategic direction from the Kremlin, pushed stories supporting former President Trump and denigrating President Biden after he became the presumptive nominee in April.`  
    - [link](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/20515484/icadeclass16mar21.pdf) - Foreign Threats to the 2020 US Federal Elections
    
    - `We assess that Russian leaders viewed President Biden's potential election as disadvantageous to Russian interests and that this drove their efforts to undermine his candidacy. We have high confidence in this assessment.  
    -   
    - Russian officials and state media frequently attacked President Biden for his leading role in the Obama administration's Ukraine policy and his support for the anti-Putin opposition in Russia, suggesting the Kremlin views him as part of a reflexively anti-Russia US foreign policy establishment. Putin probably also considers President Biden more apt to echo the idea of American "exceptionalism," which he and other Kremlin leaders have often publicly criticized as problematic and dangerous.  
    -   
    - Moscow's range of influence actors uniformly worked to denigrate President Biden after his entrance into the race. Throughout the primaries and general election campaign, Russian influence agents repeatedly spread unsubstantiated or misleading claims about President Biden and his family's alleged wrongdoing related to Ukraine. By contrast, during the Democratic primaries Russian online influence actors promoted candidates that Moscow viewed as outside what it perceives to be an anti-Russia political establishment.  
    -   
    - Even after the election, Russian online influence actors continued to promote narratives questioning the election results and disparaging President Biden and the Democratic Party. These efforts parallel plans Moscow had in place in 2016 to discredit a potential incoming Clinton administration, but which it scrapped after former President Trump's victory.`

- There was a total of 64 pre and post-election lawsuits in regards to Trump’s claims of voter integrity & fraud.
    
    - `Of the 64 cases brought by Trump and his supporters, twenty were dismissed before a hearing on the merits, fourteen were voluntarily dismissed by Trump and his supporters before a hearing on the merits, and 30 cases included a hearing on the merits. Only in one Pennsylvania case involving far too few votes to overturn the results did Trump and his supporters prevail.` [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aqorZ61AYFqZU-EDQBBzjqfvAoC5nKcB/view)
    
### SCOTUS
### Mike Kelly, et al. v. Pennsylvania, et al.
- On 3 December 2020, 28 Republican politicians, led by Rep. Mike Kelly, asked the US Supreme Court to block the certification of Pennsylvania's election results alleging that “no excuse” absentee voting law unlawfully expanded the scope of absentee voting. Plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order against certification while the courts ruled on the issue. [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/20-810.html)
- On 8 December 2020, The court turned down the case.
    
    - `First, Petitioners’ unjustifiable delay in filing suit not only supports the application of laches, but also weighs against issuing an injunction. Petitioners waited over a year after Act 77 passed—and then weeks after Election Day—to first bring their claims. Petitioners should not receive extraordinary relief after unduly delaying in a manner that created the very exigent circumstances that supposedly animate their rush to this Court.  
    -   
    - ...  
    -   
    - Second, the public interest in avoiding mass disenfranchisement of an entire state militates overwhelmingly against Petitioners’ request for relief. As Judge Sutton has explained, “[c]all it what you will—laches, the Purcell principle, or common sense—the idea is that courts will not disrupt imminent elections absent a powerful reason for doing so.”  
    -   
    - ...  
    -   
    - Finally, granting an injunction would sow chaos and confusion across the Nation while inflaming baseless concerns about electoral impropriety and ensnaring the Judiciary in partisan strife. This case reaches the Court against the backdrop of unfounded claims—which have been repeatedly rejected by state and federal courts— that wrongly impugn the integrity of the democratic process and aim to cast doubt on the legitimacy of its outcome. Given that context, the Court should not plunge itself into a firestorm by issuing the first ever judicial order decertifying the results of a presidential election. Instead, it should stay true to “the trust of a Nation that here, We the People rule.”  
    -   
    - ...  
    -   
    - Petitioner’s application for a writ of injunction should be denied.`

### Texas v. Pennsylvania, et al.
- On 7 December 2020, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan, and Wisconsin in the US Supreme Court seeking to overturn their election results. [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/22o155.html)
- On 11 December 2020,The Supreme Court rejected the case.
    
    - `The State of Texas’s motion for leave to file a bill of complaint is denied for lack of standing under Article III of the Constitution. Texas has not demonstrated a judicially cognizable interest in the manner in which another State  
    - conducts its elections. All other pending motions are dismissed as moot.  
    -   
    - Statement of Justice Alito, with whom Justice Thomas joins: In my view, we do not have discretion to deny the filing of a bill of complaint in a case that falls within our original jurisdiction. ... . I would therefore grant the motion to file the bill of complaint but would not grant other relief, and I express no view on any other issue.`

### Donald J. Trump, v. Cyrus R. Vance, Jr., et al.
- On 13 October 2020, The Trump campaign asked the US Supreme Court to overturn three decisions from the Pennsylvania Supreme Court over various technical rules regarding absentee and mail-in ballots. [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/20a63.html)
- On 22 February 2021, The court rejected the case declaring it moot.
    
    - `First, Applicant contends that he will be irreparably harmed even if the relevant documents are disclosed only to the “grand jury and prosecutors.” Appl. 33. But the primary authority Applicant cites for that proposition, Church of Scientology of Cal. v. United States, 506 U.S. 9 (1992), suggests the opposite. There, the Court held that a party’s appeal of an order requiring it to produce records to the government does not become moot even after the party has produced those records.  
    -   
    - ...  
    -   
    - Second, Applicant claims irreparable harm from the possibility that his records may be “disclosed publicly” outside the grand jury. Appl. 33. But as noted, Applicant must show a “likelihood”—not a mere hypothetical possibility—“that irreparable harm will result from the denial of” relief. ... There is no likelihood that his records will become public, given the “presumption of confidentiality [that] attaches to the record of Grand Jury proceedings.”  
    -   
    - ...  
    -   
    - Finally, Applicant contends that the purported harm is “particularly pressing” because he “challenges a subpoena to a third party.” Appl. 34. But the subpoena’s issuance to a third party (Mazars) is immaterial because everyone agrees that it “is functionally a subpoena issued to the President.” ... That is why, throughout these proceedings, Mazars has taken “no position on the legal issues raised” and indicated that it would follow any court order.`

    - `The application for a stay presented to Justice Breyer and referred to the Court is denied.` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/022221zor_2cp3.pdf)
    
### Arizona
### Aguilera v. Fontes,
- On 4 November 2020, a voter, Laurie Aguilera, filed a lawsuit accusing Maricopa County that Votes cast using Sharpies were unlawfully excluded from election results.
    
    - `Plaintiff Laurie Aguilera voted in person in Maricopa County on election day, November 3, 2020. She was provided with a sharpie by the poll workers with which to mark her ballot. Plaintiff completed her ballot with the provided sharpie. While completing it she noticed that the ink was bleeding through. Plaintiff has been voting in person for several election cycles. However, upon information and belief, she has never before been given a sharpie as a marking device by a poll worker. Plaintiff fed her ballot into the ballot box. The ballot box failed to properly register her vote causing a poll-worker to cancel her ballot in the presence of Plaintiff.  
    - Plaintiff requested a new ballot but, upon information and belief, upon consultation with the Maricopa County Reorder's Office, the poll workers refused to provide her with one. Upon information and belief, many other voters have experienced similar issues.  
    - Upon information and belief not all Arizona counties and polling places provided in-person voters with sharpies for marking devices.`  
    - [link](https://www.clerkofcourt.maricopa.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/1446/637401560936870000)
    
- On 7 November 2020, Plaintiff voluntarily dismissed after filing suit.
    
    - `Plaintiffs, pursuant to Ariz. R. Civ P. 41(a)(1)(A)(i), voluntarily dismiss without prejudice the claims in the above-entitled action against Defendants.` [link](https://www.clerkofcourt.maricopa.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/1536/637405062626170000)
    
- On 12 November 2020, a Second suit was brought by Aguilera, alleging her vote was not counted and asking for opportunity to cast a new ballot.
    
    - `Plaintiff Laurie Aguilera voted in person in Maricopa County on election day, November 3, 2020 alongside her husband Damian Aguilera. Neither Plaintiff Aguilera nor her husband are on the early voting list or received ballots by mail. Ex. B. [Aguilera family ballot status informationl. When election-day voters like Plaintiff Aguilera showed up to the polls, they were checked in by poll-workers on tablet-style devices and their names were then logged into the county's electronic pollbook. Plaintiff Aguilera and her husband were checked-in to the polls by a poll-worker. Plaintiff Aguilera completed her ballot according to the instructions provided by Defendants. Plaintiff Aguilera and her husband attempted to feed their ballots into the tabulator as instructed. Upon information and belief, when a ballot is successfully read and insetted into a tabulator, the tabulator displays a confirmation that the ballot has been accepted on a small digital readout.` [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20201116024331/https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/2020/11/CV2020-014562.pdf)
    
- On 29 November 2020, the State judge dismissed the case after an evidentiary hearing.
    
    - `Plaintiff Aguilera asserts that she was unable to successfully cast her ballot in person at the polls on 11/3/2020, Election Day. Aguilera testified that on Election Day, she and her husband Damian Aguilera went together to vote in person at the Sheraton Hotel at 26th Avenue and Dunlap in Phoenix. Aguilera's husband testified that he voted without incident just ahead of his wife. Aguilera testified that when she inserted her completed ballot into the tabulator machine, the tabulator screen did not ligtrt up or make any noise. Poll workers who came to assist Aguilera thought the tabulator looked as though it was ready to receive another ballot and told Aguilera she needed to vote again. When Aguilera began the process of doing so by scanning in her identification at the check-in kiosk, the kiosk indicated that she had already cast her ballot and gave her the option to cancel the ballot.` [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20201202180408/https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/2020/11/Final-Order-CV2020-014562-ME-11-30.pdf)
    
### Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. v. Hobbs. (Sharpie Lawsuit)
- On 7 November 2020, The Trump Campaign, Republican National Committee, and Arizona Republican Party alleged that Maricopa County elections officials violated state and federal law when overriding electronic tabulator errors for ballots rejected by an electronic tabulation device.

- There is no evidence that using Sharpies leads to issues with scanning ballots and officials have said using Sharpies is preferred. Arizona's Secretary of State Katie Hobbs tweeted,
    
    - `IMPORTANT: If you voted a regular ballot in-person, your ballot will be counted, no matter what kind of pen you used (even a Sharpie)!` [link](https://twitter.com/SecretaryHobbs/status/1324074443740647425)
    
- The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, formed in 2018 by legislation Trump signed, has also labelled the conspiracy theory a false rumour.
    
    - `Election jurisdictions allow voters to mark ballots with varying types of writing instruments, based on state law and other considerations such as tabulation system requirements. Poll workers are required to provide approved writing devices to voters.  
    -   
    - Although felt-tip pens, like Sharpies, may bleed through ballots, some election officials have stated that ballot tabulation equipment in their jurisdictions can still read these ballots. Many jurisdictions even design their ballots with offset columns to prevent any potential bleed through from impacting the ability to easily scan both sides of ballots.  
    -   
    - If a ballot has issues that impact its ability to be scanned, it can be hand counted or duplicated, or adjudicated by election officials, who use defined procedures such as chain of custody to ensure protect ballot secrecy and integrity. Many states additionally have “voter intent” laws that allow for ballots to be counted even when issues such as bleed-throughs or stray marks are present, as long as the voter’s intent can still be determined.`

- On 10 November 2020, A Republican-aligned group abandoned the legal fight after Maricopa County officials challenged the factual basis for the lawsuit.
    
    - `This lawsuit is yet one more attempt by the President’s unsuccessful reelection campaign to alter the results of a properly administered general election—or, at the very least, to cast doubt, on the integrity of the election and the veracity of the results. But once again, Plaintiffs’ claims are unmoored from both law and fact, with allegations strung together by rank speculation and selective generalization. This Court should follow the lead of its sister jurisdictions across the country and dismiss this case.  
    -   
    - For the reasons stated above, Plaintiffs’ Complaint should be dismissed.`

- On 13 November 2020, the Trump campaign lost the fight soon afterward.
    
    - `Since the close of yesterday’s hearing, the tabulation of votes statewide has rendered unnecessary a judicial ruling as to the presidential electors.` [link](https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NoticeofPartialMootness-1.pdf)

### Kelli Ward v. Constance Jackson et al., and Katie Hobbs.
- On 30 November 2020, an Arizona voter and state Republican Party Chair, Kelli Ward, filed a lawsuit in the Superior Court of Arizona, Maricopa County. Ward challenged the signature verification process, claiming election workers were unfit to verify signatures. Ward also challenged the ballot duplication process, whereby bipartisan county workers transferred votes to new ballots when ballot tabulators could not read them, claiming that observers were not allowed to view the entire process. [link](https://www.azcourts.gov/newsandinfo/High-Profile-Case-Update/CV-20-0343)
- On 4 December 2020, Arizona's Superior Court of Maricopa County
    
    - `A.R.S. § 16-672(A)(5) permits an election contest on the ground that, “by reason of erroneous count of votes” the candidate certified as the winner “did not in fact receive the highest number of votes.” Plaintiff has not proven that the Biden/Harris ticket did not receive the highest number of votes.` [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20201230073802/https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/2020/11/Order-2.pdf)
    
- On 8 December 2020, Arizona's Supreme Court unanimously rejected the appeal of the Superior Court case saying the facts Ward presented were incorrect and that she "fails to present any evidence of misconduct."
    
    - `Intervenor Maricopa County argues that the trial court could not entertain this challenge under A.R.S. § 16-672(A) which authorizes a contest of the “election of any person declared elected to state office.” Intervenors/Defendants/Amicus contend that the Court must decide this matter within the “safe harbor” deadline of 3 U.S.C. § 5.  
    -   
    - The Court concludes, unanimously, that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in denying the request to continue the hearing and permit additional inspection of the ballots. The November 9, 2020 hand count audit revealed no discrepancies in the tabulation of votes and the statistically negligible error presented in this case falls far short of warranting relief under A.R.S. § 16-672. Because the challenge fails to present any evidence of “misconduct,” “illegal votes” or that the Biden Electors “did not in fact receive the highest number of votes for office,” let alone establish any degree of fraud or a sufficient error rate that would undermine the certainty of the election results, the Court need not decide if the challenge was in fact authorized under A.R.S. § 16-672 or if the federal “safe harbor” deadline applies to this contest. Therefore,  
    -   
    - IT IS ORDERED affirming the trial court decision and confirming the election of the Biden Electors under A.R.S. § 16-676(B).`

### Bowyer v. Ducey.
- On 2 December 2020, Sidney Powell, who litigated on behalf of some Arizona voters and one candidate for Republican Arizona presidential elector, filed a lawsuit in federal court against the governor, secretary of state, and other Arizona election officials. They asked the court to decertify Arizona's election results, or order that Arizona certify Trump electors. [link](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/18707812/bowyer-v-ducey/)
- On 9 December 2020, The judge ruled that the plaintiffs lacked legal standing.
    
    - `Plaintiffs bring their Complaint seeking injunctive relief from this Court, specifically, to “set aside the results of the 2020 General Election,” because they claim the election process and results were “so riddled with fraud, illegality and statistical impossibility . . . that Arizona voters, courts and legislators cannot rely on or certify” its results. (Doc. 1 at 2). By any measure, the relief Plaintiffs seek is extraordinary. If granted, millions of Arizonans who exercised their individual right to vote in the 2020 General Election would be utterly disenfranchised. Such a request should then be accompanied by clear and conclusive facts to support the alleged “egregious range of conduct in Maricopa County and other Arizona counties . . . at the direction of Arizona state election officials.” (Id.) Yet the Complaint’s allegations are sorely wanting of relevant or reliable evidence, and Plaintiffs’ invocation of this Court’s limited jurisdiction is severely strained. Therefore, for the reasons stated herein, the Complaint shall be dismissed.` [link](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.azd.1255923/gov.uscourts.azd.1255923.84.0_2.pdf)
    
### Stevenson v. Ducey,
- On 4 December 2020, A group of voters alleged that Arizona election officials did not enforce Arizona residency requirements, permitted “double voting,” and used the Center for Tech and Civic Life to create illegal disparities in ballot and drop-box voting in demographically different areas of Arizona. Plaintiffs sought an injunction to prevent the certification of the election results and asked the governor to certify legislatively selected Presidential Electors.
    
    - `The Plaintiffs, by and through their attorneys of record, file this voter election contest to vacate the certification of the November 3, 2020 Presidential election result in Arizona pursuant to Arizona Statutes § 16-672 et. seq. The election officials’ absentee ballot error rate is legally unacceptable in light of the razor-thin vote margin.` [link](https://www.clerkofcourt.maricopa.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/1914/637426926829400000)
    
- On 7 November 2020, Plaintiff voluntarily dismissed after filing suit.
    
    - `Petitioners, pursuant to Rule 41 (a)(1)(A)(i) of the Arizona Rules of Civil Procedure, hereby give notice of their voluntary dismissal of the above-captioned action, without prejudice, and with no costs assigned to either party.

### Burk v. Ducey,
- On 7 November 2020, A voter alleged widespread voter fraud, including: failing to count valid ballots and fraudulently switching Trump votes to Biden ones; counting unlawful absentee and mail-in ballots; committing fraud with Dominion machines; and violating observation rights. The voter asked the court to decertify Arizona’s presidential election results or exclude unlawful absentee and mail-in ballots from the count.
    
    - `Plaintiff brings forth this election complaint to bring forth election fraud as well as violations of Arizona election laws, Electors Clauses, and the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, of the U.S. Constitution. These violations occurred during the 2020 General Election throughout the State of Arizona, as set forth in the affidavits of eyewitnesses and the voter data cited, the statistical anomalies and mathematical impossibilities detailed in the affidavits of expert witnesses.  
    -   
    - Plaintiff alleges a widespread scheme and artifice to defraud the election for the purpose of illegally and fraudulently manipulating the vote count to manufacture an election of Joe Biden as President of the United States,and also of various down ballot democrat candidates in the 2020 election cycle. This fraud was executed by the systemic adaptation of old-fashioned "ballot-stuffing," which included the transport of fraudulent ballots taken to the county tabulation center as well as by using software to manipulate the vote count in Maricopa County and using fraudulent and altered ballots in outlying counties to create an appearance ofa similar proportional result in the outlying counties such as Pinal.  
    -   
    - The widespread election fraud has now been amplified and rendered virtually invisible by computer software reated and run by domestic and foreign actors for this very purpose. This Complaint details an especially egregious nge of conduct in Maricopa County and other Arizona counties using employing Dominion Systems, though this onduct occurred throughout the State at the direction of Arizona state election officials.`  
    - [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20201210162730/https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/2020/12/Burk-v-Ducey-complaint.pdf)
    
- On 15 November 2020, The State judge dismissed case after argument for lack of standing as voter did not show they were registered, also finding the complaint was untimely and barred by laches.
    
    - `The Court has reviewed and considered the Motions to Dismiss filed by the Governor. the Secretary of State and the Maricopa County Attorneys Office and the Response filed by Plaintiff. In addition, the Court has also considered the oral arguments of counsel. the Notice of Filing, filed on December 14, 2020 by the Secretary of State and Plaintiffs Response to it.  
    -   
    - Good cause exists to grant the Motions to Dismiss on multiple separate and independent grounds raised by the moving parties, including the following:  
    -   
    - PLAINTIFF IS NOT AUTHORIZEQ. BRING It-its ELECTION CONTEST BECAUSE SHE WAS NOT REGISTERED TO VOTE IN THE 2020 GENERAL ELECTION WHEN SHE FILED HER COMPLAINT`  
    - [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20201230074056/https://healthyelections-case-tracker.stanford.edu/file?id=179)
    
- On 3 March 2021, the case was filed with SCOTUS but was denied.
    
    - `This action is brought to secure equitable relief resulting from Defendants' unlawful deprivation of Plaintiffs rights, privileges, and immunities guaranteed by the Equal Protection and Due Process Clause of the U.S. Const. Amend. XIV, the U.S. Const. Amend. I, and the laws of Arizona and the United States. Petitioner contends the juxtaposition of unqualified voters having their vote counted in the 2020 election, while a real person (Petitioner) was illegally denied her voice is the heart of her constitutional and election challenge claims.` [link](https://crimeofthecentury2020.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Petition030321.pdf)

In re: Enforcement of Election Laws and Securing Ballots Cast or Received after 7:00pm on November 3, 2020. [link](https://healthyelections-case-tracker.stanford.edu/detail?id=345)
- On 4 November 2020, the Trump campaign and the Georgia Republican Party filed suit in the Chatham County Superior Court, alleging that the Chatham County Board of Elections had failed "to safely store absentee ballots" and might be illegally accepting "absentee ballots arriving after 7:00 p.m. on Election Day.”
- On 5 November 2020, The judge denied the request to toss out the 53 ballots that a GOP poll watcher said arrived after polls closed at 7 p.m. on November 3.
    
    - `Before the Court is a Petition to Command Enforcement of Election Laws which was filed by the Georgia Republican Party and Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. The matter was heard via Webex on November 5, 2020. Having read and considered said petition, all argument and evidence of record, including the evidence presented at the hearing, and the applicable law, the Court finds that there is no evidence that the ballots referenced in the petition were received after 7:00 p.m. on election day, thereby making those ballots invalid. Additionally, there is no evidence that the Chatham County Board of Elections or the Chatham County Board of Registrars has failed to comply with the law.  
    -   
    - WHEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the above petition is DISMISSED.`

- Republican elector Lin Wood, [whose attorney also represents the Trump campaign](https://lawandcrime.com/2020-election/trump-appointed-judge-rejects-lin-woods-creative-election-lawsuit-in-georgia/), sued to stop vote certification because. He argued that because the Georgia Secretary of State agreed to allow signature matching on ballots — a measure designed to prevent voter fraud — eight months before the election, his rights as an individual voter had been infringed upon. A state judge [dismissed the case](https://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/judge-dismisses-trump-campaign-lawsuit-seeking-to-halt-georgia-election-certification), [saying the arguments have "no basis in fact and law."](https://lawandcrime.com/2020-election/trump-appointed-judge-rejects-lin-woods-creative-election-lawsuit-in-georgia/)
  
  
- Wood filed another lawsuit in federal court and [lost that one as well](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/7334748/12-5-20-11th-Circuit-Opinion-Wood-v-Raffensperger.pdf), [losing again upon appeal](https://twitter.com/marceelias/status/1343603310293606401).
  
  
- Sidney Powell, [who was kicked off of Trump's legal team](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-lost-patience-with-conspiracy-theorist-attorney-powell-nyt-2020-11) after spreading numerous conspiracy theories about election fraud, filed a federal lawsuit in Georgia alleging widespread election fraud. A federal judge [quickly dismissed the case](https://www.businessinsider.com/sidney-powell-loses-2-kraken-lawsuits-in-one-day-in-georgia-michigan-2020-12), calling it "extraordinary" that the lawsuit sought to disqualify the votes of millions of voters.
  
  
- Nearly two months after he lost the election, [Trump sued Georgia Governor Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brian Raffensperger](https://lawandcrime.com/2020-election/trumps-new-lawsuit-seeking-to-decertify-georgia-election-provides-insight-into-absurd-claims-made-in-his-call-with-secretary-of-state/) seeking to "de-certify" the election, arguing that it wasn't carried out in accordance with Georgia law. Trump withdrew the case on January 7, according to court records reviewed by Insider.
### Michigan
- In a federal lawsuit, the Trump campaign alleged a number of irregularities — [such as that GOP election observers were told to stand six feet away from ballot counters because of the coronavirus](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-michigan-election-lawsuit-poll-watchers-social-distancing-complaints-2020-11) — meant that Michigan should not certify its votes. The Trump campaign [withdrew the lawsuit](https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.miwd.99598/gov.uscourts.miwd.99598.33.0.pdf), with [Rudy Giuliani falsely declaring it achieved the result the campaign wanted](https://twitter.com/WardDPatrick/status/1329444160701685762).
- A judge on the Michigan Court of Claims denied the Trump campaign's request to stop counting ballots in the state. [Judge Cynthia Stephens said](https://www.michigan.gov/documents/ag/20201106_Opin_and_Ord_707156_7.pdf) litigating the issue didn't make sense given that ballots in Michigan had more or less been fully counted.
- A poll challenger named Sarah Stoddard and a group called the Election Integrity Fund [filed a lawsuit](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/detroit-city/2020/11/05/election-challenger-suit-halt-detroit-absentee-vote-count/6181615002/) seeking to stop the certification of election results in Detroit, claiming that absentee ballots were improperly reviewed. Judge Timothy Kenny [denied](https://www.michigan.gov/documents/ag/Stoddard_et_al_v_City_Election_Commission_et_al_-_11-06-2020_707182_7.pdf) the motion on the grounds that there was no proof that election oversight protocol hadn't been followed. Kenny issued another ruling later denying other motions, including [a request for an additional audit of the election](https://beta.documentcloud.org/documents/20407012-michigan-election-lawsuit-kenney-costantino-et-al-v-wayne-boc-et-al-opinion-order).
- A [Republican-aligned law firm](https://greatlakesjc.org/cases/costantino_v_detroit/) called the Great Lakes Justice Center [filed a lawsuit](https://greatlakesjc.org/wp-content/uploads/Complaint-Costantino-FINAL-With-Exhibits.pdf?x44644) in Wayne County's Circuit Court against Detroit and Wayne County alleging "massive fraud in the election vote-counting procedures" and calling for an entirely new election. A judge [denied](https://www.wsj.com/articles/michigan-judge-denies-conservative-group-s-request-to-delay-detroit-election-certification-11605295879) the case.
    
    - `Perhaps if Plaintiffs’ election challenger affiants had attended the October 29, 2020 walk-through of the TCF Center ballot counting location, questions and concerns could have been answered in advance of Election Day. Regrettably, they did not and, therefore, Plaintiffs’ affiants did not have a full understanding of the TCF absent ballot tabulation process. No formal challenges were filed. However, sinister, fraudulent motives were ascribed to the process and the City of Detroit. Plaintiffs’ interpretation of events is incorrect and not credible.` [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20210522064008/https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/2020/11/Scanned-from-a-Xerox-Multifunction-Printer.pdf)
    
- Trump ally Sidney Powell also has a federal lawsuit pending in Michigan. It asks the judge to "de-certify" the state's electoral votes, which have already gone to Biden. The lawsuit [has numerous typos](https://www.businessinsider.com/sidney-powell-hypes-election-lawsuit-despite-trump-disowning-2020-11) and [cites voting statistics from a county that does not exist](https://www.businessinsider.com/sidney-powell-election-lawsuit-witness-vote-problems-edison-county-2020-12). A judge [ruled against her](https://www.businessinsider.com/sidney-powell-loses-2-kraken-lawsuits-in-one-day-in-georgia-michigan-2020-12) and issued a scathing 35-page opinion tearing it down on multiple fronts. She has [appealed it all the way to the Supreme Court](https://lawandcrime.com/2020-election/kraken-concerned-about-elementh-amendment-lands-on-scotus-docket-asks-court-do-what-the-ghosts-on-other-side-of-potomac-would-have-wanted/), which [has not yet decided](https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/20-815.html) whether to take the case.
### Nevada
- The Trump campaign filed a lawsuit requesting that ballots stop being counted in the state over concerns about signature-matching technology and election observers' claims that they weren't being allowed to watch ballots being processed closely enough. The Nevada Supreme Court [denied the request](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/trump-files-emergency-nevada-appeal-over-clark-county-ballots).
- The Trump campaign and the RNC filed a lawsuit in state court asking to stop ballot counting in Clark County — a heavily Democratic area — until GOP officials could observe the process. A district judge rejected the request on the grounds that the plaintiffs did not have evidence to back up their allegations. Republicans appealed the case to the Nevada Supreme Court, which said on November 5 that the campaign and Republican officials had [reached a settlement that allowed expanded ballot observation](https://news3lv.com/news/local/trump-campaign-reaches-settlement-in-nevada-lawsuit-to-expand-ballot-observation).

- The Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee filed a lawsuit asking a state appeals court to reject the Pennsylvania secretary of state's announcement that registered voters had until November 12 to provide proof of identity for mail-in ballots. Republicans believe the deadline should be November 9. This is the one case [that Trump won](https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/11/12/trump-campaign-election-2020-presidential-pennsylvania-lawsuit-ballots-late-identification/stories/202011120132), before the state Supreme Court [overturned the lower court decision](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/17/philadelphia-donald-trump-us-elections-2020-joe-biden).
- In [a wide-ranging federal lawsuit](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-pennsylvania-election-lawsuit-allege-voter-fraud-2-counties-2020-11), the Trump campaign sued over alleged irregularities in the way ballots were counted throughout the state.

The campaign submitted [a revised version of the lawsuit](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-campaign-drops-part-of-pa-lawsuit-regarding-election-observers-2020-11) days later that retracted many of its original allegations. A judge [threw out the case](https://www.businessinsider.com/federal-judge-brann-rejects-trump-campaign-lawsuit-pennsylvania-2020-11), saying Trump's lawyers presented the court "with [strained legal arguments](https://www.businessinsider.com/pennsylvania-defense-lawyers-shredded-rudy-giuliani-trump-election-lawsuit-2020-11) without merit and speculative accusations, unpaid in the operative complaint and unsupported by evidence."

Republicans [abandoned the lawsuit and withdrew from the case](https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/2020/11/ORDER-1.pdf).
- The campaign sued in yet another federal case [to stop Philadelphia County from counting votes](https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/2020/11/FullText.pdf) without Republicans present. The judge [dismissed the case](https://whyy.org/articles/trump-asks-federal-court-to-stop-vote-counting-in-phiadelphia/) after Trump's lawyers said Republican election watchers were, in fact, present.

- A lawsuit in Bucks County filed by Republican congressional candidate Kathy Barnette on Election Day made a technical challenge on the county's method of organizing ballots before counting them. She [withdrew the case](https://www.buckscountycouriertimes.com/story/news/2020/11/05/barnette-withdraws-mail-ballot-lawsuit-montgomery-county-election/6176910002/) two days later and lost the election.
- The Trump campaign [appealed that Bucks County case](https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/2020/11/TS-Petition-for-Review-of-Decision-by-Bucks-County-Board-of-Elections-11.9.2020-1.pdf) soon afterward, but a judge [rejected it](http://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2020/images/11/19/scan.document_11192020_041015.pdf) and [pointed out in his ruling](https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/19/politics/arizona-pennsylvania-georgia-lawsuits-trump-biden/index.html) that fraud wasn't an issue.
- In a state court, Republicans [challenged an instruction from the Secretary of State's office regarding provisional ballots](https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/2020/11/Preview_08501C84-5760-47CE-A63C-47106B07AB6D-1.pdf). A state appellate court judge [dismissed](https://twitter.com/johnkruzel/status/1324811512003891202) the request but [ordered](https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/2020/11/FILE-8407.pdf) the secretary of state to [segregate](https://www.businessinsider.com/why-pennsylvania-texas-minnesota-segregating-ballots-in-case-thrown-out-2020-11) provisional ballots in case their validity becomes contested.
- Local Republicans sought to stop Northampton County from revealing the identities of people whose ballots were canceled and [lost the case](https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/2020/11/ORDER-11-3-20.pdf).
- A group of Pennsylvania Republicans [lost](https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/28/politics/pennsylvania-state-supreme-court-election-case/index.html) at the state Supreme Court with a lawsuit trying to invalidate absentee voting after the voting period already ended, and trying to block the certification of election results.
- Another group of Republicans filed [a similar lawsuit](https://www.democracydocket.com/cases/pennsylvania-decertification-challenge/) and lost.
- The Trump campaign filed a [motion to intervene in a Supreme Court case](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-trump-may-challenge-2020-election-supreme-court-2020-11) brought by Republicans that centers on the deadline by which Pennsylvania officials are allowed to receive ballots. Pennsylvania's Supreme Court ruled that officials could receive ballots until November 6 as long as they are postmarked by Election Day. Republicans appealed the decision to the high court, which was deadlocked at 4-4 because Justice Amy Coney Barrett did not participate, leaving the lower court's ruling in place. The Supreme Court signaled it could hear the case again but has not granted the request to intervene.
### Wisconsin
- The Wisconsin Supreme Court [rejected a case](https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-donald-trump-wisconsin-lawsuits-2917742813e06908608848410ff41b0c) from the Trump campaign seeking to overturn election results.
- Trump personally filed a similar lawsuit in a federal court in Wisconsin. A Trump-appointed federal judge said he had standing to bring the case — a rare departure from other judges — [and then ruled against him](https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2020/12/12/trump-wisconsin-lawsuit-dismissed-federal-judge/3894689001/). [An appeal failed as well](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/24/trump-loses-wisconsin-georgia-450433), with the author of the appellate opinion also a Trump appointee.
- Wisconsin Voters Alliance, a right-wing group, [sued the state elections commission](https://www.wpr.org/lawsuit-asks-wisconsin-supreme-court-throw-out-results-presidential-election) and asked the state Supreme Court to throw out votes and have the Republican-controlled state legislature select the electoral college winner themselves. [The state Supreme Court rejected it, saying it had little basis in fact](https://www.channel3000.com/state-supreme-court-rejects-lawsuit-from-conservative-group-attempting-to-prevent-certification-of-election-results/).
    
    - `At stake, in some meas­ure, is faith in our system of free and fair elec­tions, a feature cent­ral to the endur­ing strength of our consti­tu­tional repub­lic. It can be easy to blithely move on to the next case with a peti­tion so obvi­ously lack­ing, but this is sober­ing. The relief being sought by the peti­tion­ers is the most dramatic invoc­a­tion of judi­cial power I have ever seen. Judi­cial acqui­es­cence to such entreat­ies built on so flimsy a found­a­tion would do indelible damage to every future elec­tion.` [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20210522064207/https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/2020/11/2020AP1930-OAfinal-12-4-20.pdf)
    
- Wisconsin Voter Alliance also sued a number of defendants in Washington, DC, including Vice President Mike Pence, both houses of Congress, and the Electoral College, trying to block the certification of Wisconsin's votes as well as those of other states. [A federal judge threw out the case](https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.225330/gov.uscourts.dcd.225330.10.0_1.pdf), blasted it as an attempted "undermining of a democratic election" full of falsehoods, and said he would refer the attorneys for sanctions.
- [Another lawsuit](https://www.wpr.org/new-lawsuit-asks-state-supreme-court-toss-nov-3-election-results) backed by the Republican-aligned Amos Center for Justice and Liberty argued that the use of ballot drop-boxes was illegal. It also asked that the state Supreme Court should throw out every vote cast and have the GOP legislature select the state's electoral votes. A judge [ruled it moot](https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/2020/11/2020AP1958-OA-12-3-20.pdf).
- A lawsuit from Sidney Powell and Lin Wood, another Trump ally, makes numerous conspiratorial claims about the election. A federal judge [criticized it for containing errors and typos, and one person listed as plaintiff said they never signed up to be a part of the lawsuit](https://lawandcrime.com/2020-election/wisconsin-federal-judge-picks-apart-sidney-powell-and-lin-woods-lawsuit-in-brutal-order/), later [dismissing the case](https://www.businessinsider.com/sidney-powell-lawsuits-dismissed-michigan-georgia-arizona-wisconsin-2020-12).
- Trump and Pence personally sued Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris in a state court [seeking to overturn votes](https://lawandcrime.com/2020-election/outgoing-trump-white-house-sues-incoming-biden-white-house-to-disenfranchise-wisconsins-most-diverse-counties/) in two Wisconsin counties with large Black populations, both of which sided with Democrats. A judge [threw out the case](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-loses-wisconsin-election-lawsuit-challenging-mail-votes-2020-12). When Trump appealed the case, another judge rejected it and [said it "smacks of racism."](https://www.businessinsider.com/wisconsin-trump-election-fraud-lawsuit-smacks-of-racism-judge-says-2020-12) [An appeal to the Supreme Court also failed](https://www.wicourts.gov/sc/opinion/DisplayDocument.pdf?content=pdf&seqNo=315395).

Mike can send it back!` [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20210106060056/https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1346698217304584192)
    
- On 6 January 2021 @ 8:17AM EST, President Trump tweeted,
    
    - `States want to correct their votes, which they now know were based on irregularities and fraud, plus corrupt process never received legislative approval.

    - `So we’re going to, we’re going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue. I love Pennsylvania Avenue. And we’re going to the Capitol, and we’re going to try and give.  
    -   
    - The Democrats are hopeless, they never vote for anything. Not even one vote. But we’re going to try and give our Republicans, the weak ones because the strong ones don’t need any of our help. We’re going to try and give them the kind of pride and boldness that they need to take back our country.  
    -   
    - So let’s walk down Pennsylvania Avenue.`

- On 6 January 2021 @ 13:05PM EST, Vice President Pence released a letter about the Electoral College certification,
    
    - `Given the controversy surrounding this year's election, some approach this year's quadrennial tradition with great expectation, and others with dismissive disdain. Some believe that as Vice President, I should be able to accept or reject electoral votes unilaterally. Others believe that electoral votes should never be challenged in a Joint Session of Congress. After a careful study of our Constitution, our laws, and our history, I believe neither view is correct.  
    -   
    - ...  
    -   
    - Four years ago, surrounded by my family, I took an oath to support and defend the Constitution, which ended with the words, “ So help me God. ” Today I want to assure the American people that I will keep the oath I made to them and I will keep the oath I made to Almighty God. When the Joint Session of Congress convenes today, I will do my duty to see to it that we open the certificates of the Electors of the several states, we hear objections raised by Senators and Representatives, and we count the votes of the Electoral College for President and Vice President in a manner consistent with our Constitution, laws, and history. So Help Me God.`

We have to have peace. We have to have law and order. We have to respect our great people in law and order. We don't want anybody hurt. It's a very tough period of time. There's never been a time like this where such a thing happened where they could take it away from all of us, from me, from you, from our country. This was a fraudulent election. But we can't play into the hands of these people. We have to have peace. So go home, we love you. You're very special. You've seen what happens.

## Post-Presidency Controversy’s
### 2019-24 Business Fraud Civil Suit
- [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_civil_investigation_of_The_Trump_Organization)
- [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iX0mULW0XZI&t)
- New York v. Trump, et al.
- In 2019, New York State Attorney General Letitia James had begun investigating the Trump Organization for potential financial fraud in a civil capacity.
- On 21 September 2022, New York attorney general Letitia James, filed a lawsuit accusing Donald Trump, Donald Trump Jr, Eric Trump, Ivanka Trump, and former Trump Organisation CFO Allen Weisselberg for overvaluing assets by billions of dollars.
    
    - `Mr. Trump and others affiliated with the Trump Organization who are named as Defendants employed a number of deceptive strategies as part of the overall scheme to fraudulently and falsely inflate Mr. Trump’s assets in order to comply with Mr. Trump’s instruction to increase his net worth. A chart showing many of the deceptive strategies employed by Mr. Trump and other Defendants by asset and year is attached as Exhibit 1, and includes the following, to list just a few:  
    -   
    - a. Relying on objectively false numbers to calculate property values. For example, Mr. Trump’s own triplex apartment in Trump Tower was valued as being 30,000 square feet when it was 10,996 square feet. As a result, in 2015 the apartment was valued at $327 million in total, or $29,738 per square foot. That price was absurd given the fact that at that point only one apartment in New York City had ever sold for even $100 million, at a price per square foot of less than $10,000. And that sale was in a newly built, ultra-tall tower. In 30 year-old Trump Tower, the record sale as of 2015 was a mere $16.5 million at a price of less than $4,500 per square foot.  
    -   
    - b. Ignoring legal restrictions on development rights and marketability that would materially decrease property values. For example:  
    -   
    - i. In the 2012 Statement, rent stabilized apartments at Trump Park Avenue were valued as if they were unrestricted, leading to a nearly $50 million valuation for those units—but an appraisal accounting for those units’ stabilized status valued them collectively at just $750,000;  
    -   
    - ii. The Mar-a-Lago club was valued as high as $739 million based on the false premise that it was unrestricted property and could be developed and sold for residential use, even though Mr. Trump himself signed deeds donating his residential development rights and sharply restricting changes to the property – in reality, the club generated annual revenues of less than $25 million and should have been valued at closer to $75 million; and  
    -   
    - iii. For his golf course in Aberdeen, Scotland, the valuation assumed 2,500 homes could be developed when the Trump Organization had obtained zoning approval to develop less than 1,500 cottages and apartments, many of which were expressly identified as being only for short-term rental. The $267 million value attributed to those 2,500 homes accounted for more than 80% of the total $327 million valuation for the Aberdeen property on the 2014 Statement.  
    -   
    - c. Failing to use basic rules of valuation to ensure reliable and accurate results—such as discounting revenue or cash flow that might be obtained from a speculative development far into the future to its present value. For example, a series of high-value properties estimated the profits from developing and selling homes without accounting for the years it would take to plan, build, and sell the homes and instead operated under the impossible and thus false premise that the homes could be planned, built, and sold instantaneously.  
    -   
    - d. Using an inappropriate valuation method for a given category of assets. For example, for the period 2013 to 2020, Mr. Trump’s golf course in Jupiter, Florida was valued using a fixed-asset approach even though that was not an acceptable method for valuing an operating golf course. And the bulk of the value in that fixed-asset approach was based on the use of an inflated purchase price from the purported assumption of “refundable” membership liabilities. Mr. Trump claimed to have paid $46 million for the club, consisting of $5 million in cash he actually paid and $41 million in assumed membership liabilities. In the Statement Mr. Trump did not disclose the inclusion of those inflated liabilities in the price of the club and in fact took the opposite position, stating that his potential liability for those membership deposits was zero.  
    -   
    - e. Increasing the value of golf clubs to incorporate a “brand premium” despite expressly advising in the Statements that brand value was not included in the figures and despite GAAP rules prohibiting inclusion of internally-generated intangible brand premiums. For example, in the 2013 Statement, the value of Mr. Trump’s golf course in Jupiter, Florida was further inflated by fraudulently adding 30% for the Trump “brand.” Combining the inflation from using the fixed-asset approach with the 30% brand premium, Mr. Trump claimed that a club he purchased for $5 million in 2012 was worth more than $62 million in 2013. The 2013 Statement included the same fraudulent 30% brand premium for six other golf clubs.  
    -   
    - f. Using inflated net operating income (“NOI”) figures and arbitrarily low capitalization rates to calculate valuations using the income capitalization method, where value is derived by dividing NOI by a capitalization rate. For example, in some instances the NOI for Trump Tower relied on favorable numbers by mixing time periods, using future income that exceeded the Trump Organization’s internal budget projections while also using expense figures that were lower than past expenses in audited financials. Capitalization rates were derived by cherry-picking an unsupported figure from, or averaging the lowest two or three capitalization rates listed in, generic marketing reports and ignoring rates in those same reports for buildings that were closer and more comparable to Trump Tower.  
    -   
    - g. Claiming as Mr. Trump’s own “cash” monies belonging not to Mr. Trump but to partnerships in which Mr. Trump had only a limited partnership interest with no control over making disbursements. For example, one-third of the amount under “cash and cash equivalents” listed in the 2018 Statement belonged to Vornado Partnerships, not Mr. Trump. Those are partnerships in which he owns a minority 30% stake with no right to control distributions. Mr. Trump did the same thing in counting funds held in escrow. For example, one-half of the amount under “escrow” in the 2014 Statement belonged to the Vornado Partnership.  
    -   
    - h. Including in the value of golf clubs anticipated income from inflated membership initiation fees. For example, at Mr. Trump’s golf course in Westchester, the valuation for 2011 assumed new members would pay an initiation fee of nearly $200,000 for each of the 67 unsold memberships, even though many new members in that year paid no initiation fee at all. In some instances, Mr. Trump specifically directed club employees to reduce or eliminate the initiation fees to boost membership numbers.`

An aide to Trump, Walt Nauta was also indited for the same charges barring Wilful Retention of National Defence Information.
    
    - `The classified documents TRUMP stored in his boxes included information regarding defense and weapons capabilities of both the United States and foreign countries; United States nuclear programs; potential vulnerabilities of the United States and its allies to military attack; and plans for possible retaliation in response to as-foreign attack. The unauthorized disclosure of these classified documents could put at risk the national security of the United States, foreign relations, the safety of the United States military, and human sources and the continued viability of sensitive intelligence collection methods.  
    -   
    - At 12:00 p.m. on January 20, 2021, TRUMP ceased to be president. As he departed the White House, TRUMP caused scores of boxes, many of which contained classified documents, to be transported to The Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida, where he maintained his residence. TRUMP was not authorized to possess or retain those classified documents.`

    - “I want to thank Jim Trusty and John Rowley for their work, but they were up against a very dishonest, corrupt, evil, and ‘sick’ group of people, the likes of which has not been seen before. We will be announcing additional lawyers in the coming days,” he added.  
    -   
    - Mr Rowley and Mr Trusty issued a joint statement in which they said that they had “tendered our resignations as counsel to President Trump, and we will no longer represent him on either the indicted case or the January 6 investigation”.`

### Further Recovered Documents
- On 21 May 2024, Trump handed in a further
    
    - `Remarkably, the report regarding the Mar-a-Lago search, conducted on December 15-16, 2023, uncovered four more responsive records. See id., Ex. D at 1-15 (four responsive records found at Mar-a-Lago on December 15-16, 2022). The certification misleadingly refers to these documents as "low-level ministerial documents" without any explicit mention whether they had classification markings, indicating only that one document includes "an explanation that it was no longer deemed `classified' if not connected to the attachment, and this document had no attachment." Id. ¶ 49. To be clear, the four documents were responsive to the May 2022 subpoena: "On or about December 15, 2022," the former president's counsel informed the government that "a box containing four documents or partial documents, totaling six pages, with classification markings were found in a closet" of the Office's designated space at Mar-a-Lago and "[t]hose documents contained markings at the Secret level."  
    -   
    - The Office provided the entire box in which the four responsive records were located to the FBI on approximately January 5, 2023, in compliance with another subpoena. Id.11 That was still not the end of the production of responsive records. In complying with the subpoena to produce that box, the Office also provided the FBI with two additional documents responsive to the May 2022 subpoena: "one empty folder and another mostly empty folder marked `Classified Evening Summary" that were found in the former president's bedroom at Mar-a-Lago.`

- On 1 July 2024, SCOTUS held that President’s are entitled to `Presumptive Immunity`
- Syllabus
    
    - `When the President exercises such authority, Congress cannot act on, and courts cannot examine, the President’s actions. It follows that an Act of Congress—either a specific one targeted at the President or a generally applicable one—may not criminalize the President’s actions within his exclusive constitutional power. Neither may the courts adjudicate a criminal prosecution that examines such Presidential actions.` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024), Syllabus
    
    - `The reasons that justify the President’s absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for acts within the scope of his exclusive constitutional authority do not extend to conduct in areas where his authority is shared with Congress.` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024), Syllabus
    
    - `the Court concludes that the separation of powers principles explicated in the Court’s precedent necessitate at least a presumptive immunity from criminal prosecution for a President’s acts within the outer perimeter of his official responsibility. Such an immunity is required to safeguard the independence and effective functioning of the Executive Branch, and to enable the President to carry out his constitutional duties without undue caution. At a minimum, the President must be immune from prosecution for an official act unless the Government can show that applying a criminal prohibition to that act would pose no “dangers of intrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch.” Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 754. Pp. 12–15.` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024), Syllabus
    
    - `As for a President’s unofficial acts, there is no immunity. Although Presidential immunity is required for official actions to ensure that the President’s decisionmaking is not distorted by the threat of future litigation stemming from those actions, that concern does not support immunity for unofficial conduct. Clinton, 520 U. S., at 694, and n. 19. The separation of powers does not bar a prosecution predicated on the President’s unofficial acts. P. 15.` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024), Syllabus
    
    - `The immunity the Court has recognized therefore extends to the “outer perimeter” of the President’s official responsibilities, covering actions so long as they are “not manifestly or palpably beyond [his] authority.” Blassingame v. Trump, 87 F. 4th 1, 13 (CADC).` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024), Syllabus
    
    - `In dividing official from unofficial conduct, courts may not inquire into the President’s motives. Such a “highly intrusive” inquiry would risk exposing even the most obvious instances of official conduct to judicial examination on the mere allegation of improper purpose. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 756.` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024), Syllabus
    
    - `Because the President cannot be prosecuted for conduct within his exclusive constitutional authority, Trump is absolutely immune from prosecution for the alleged conduct involving his discussions with Justice Department officials.` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024), Syllabus
    
    - `Whenever the President and Vice President discuss their official responsibilities, they engage in official conduct. Presiding over the January 6 certification proceeding at which Members of Congress count the electoral votes is a constitutional and statutory duty of the Vice President. Art. II, §1, cl. 3; Amdt. 12; 3 U. S. C. §15. The indictment’s allegations that Trump attempted to pressure the Vice President to take particular acts in connection with his role at the certification proceeding thus involve official conduct, and Trump is at least presumptively immune from prosecution for such conduct.` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024), Syllabus
    
    - `The question then becomes whether that presumption of immunity is rebutted under the circumstances. It is the Government’s burden to rebut the presumption of immunity. The Court therefore remands to the District Court to assess in the first instance whether a prosecution involving Trump’s alleged attempts to influence the Vice President’s oversight of the certification proceeding would pose any dangers of intrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch. Pp. 21–24.` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024), Syllabus
    
    - `Determining whose characterization may be correct, and with respect to which conduct, requires a fact-specific analysis of the indictment’s extensive and interrelated allegations. The Court accordingly remands to the District Court to determine in the first instance whether Trump’s conduct in this area qualifies as official or unofficial. Pp. 24–28.` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024), Syllabus
    
    - `Presidents cannot be indicted based on conduct for which they are immune from prosecution. On remand, the District Court must carefully analyze the indictment’s remaining allegations to determine whether they too involve conduct for which a President must be immune from prosecution. And the parties and the District Court must ensure that sufficient allegations support the indictment’s charges without such conduct. Testimony or private records of the President or his advisers probing such conduct may not be admitted as evidence at trial. Pp. 30–32.` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024), Syllabus
    
    - `The Federalist Papers on which Trump relies concerned the checks available against a sitting President; they did not endorse or even consider whether the Impeachment Judgment Clause immunizes a former President from prosecution. Transforming the political process of impeachment into a necessary step in the enforcement of criminal law finds little support in the text of the Constitution or the structure of the Nation’s Government. Pp. 32–34.` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024), Syllabus
    
    - `This case poses a question of lasting significance: When may a former President be prosecuted for official acts taken during his Presidency? In answering that question, unlike the political branches and the public at large, the Court cannot afford to fixate exclusively, or even primarily, on present exigencies. Enduring separation of powers principles guide our decision in this case. The President enjoys no immunity for his unofficial acts, and not everything the President does is official. The President is not above the law. But under our system of separated powers, the President may not be prosecuted for exercising his core constitutional powers, and he is entitled to at least presumptive immunity from prosecution for his official acts. That immunity applies equally to all occupants of the Oval Office.` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024), Syllabus
    
- Justice Roberts Opinion of the Court
    
    - `We granted certiorari to consider the following question: “Whether and if so to what extent does a former President enjoy presidential immunity from criminal prosecution for conduct alleged to involve official acts during his tenure in office.”` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024)
    
    - `This case is the first criminal prosecution in our Nation’s history of a former President for actions taken during his Presidency. We are called upon to consider whether and under what circumstances such a prosecution may proceed. Doing so requires careful assessment of the scope of Presidential power under the Constitution. We undertake that responsibility conscious that we must not confuse “the issue of a power’s validity with the cause it is invoked to promote,” but must instead focus on the “enduring consequences upon the balanced power structure of our Republic.”` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024)
    
    - `If the President claims authority to act but in fact exercises mere “individual will” and “authority without law,” the courts may say so. Youngstown, 343 U. S., at 655 (Jackson, J., concurring). In Youngstown, for instance, we held that President Truman exceeded his constitutional authority when he seized most of the Nation’s steel mills. See id., at 582–589 (majority opinion). But once it is determined that the President acted within the scope of his exclusive authority, his discretion in exercising such authority cannot be subject to further judicial examination.` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024)
    
    - `At a minimum, the President must therefore be immune from prosecution for an official act unless the Government can show that applying a criminal prohibition to that act would pose no “dangers of intrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch.” Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 754.` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024)
    
    - `And some Presidential conduct—for example, speaking to and on behalf of the American people, see Trump v. Hawaii, 585 U. S. 667, 701 (2018)—certainly can qualify as official even when not obviously connected to a particular constitutional or statutory provision. For those reasons, the immunity we have recognized extends to the “outer perimeter” of the President’s official responsibilities, covering actions so long as they are “not manifestly or palpably beyond [his] authority.”` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024)
    
    - `In dividing official from unofficial conduct, courts may not inquire into the President’s motives. Such an inquiry would risk exposing even the most obvious instances of official conduct to judicial examination on the mere allegation of improper purpose, thereby intruding on the Article II interests that immunity seeks to protect.` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024)
    
    - `The indictment’s allegations that the requested investigations were “sham[s]” or proposed for an improper purpose do not divest the President of exclusive authority over the investigative and prosecutorial functions of the Justice Department and its officials. App. 186–187, Indictment ¶10(c). And the President cannot be prosecuted for conduct within his exclusive constitutional authority. Trump is therefore absolutely immune from prosecution for the alleged conduct involving his discussions with Justice Department officials.` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024)
    
    - `Whenever the President and Vice President discuss their official responsibilities, they engage in official conduct. Presiding over the January 6 certification proceeding at which Members of Congress count the electoral votes is a constitutional and statutory duty of the Vice President. Art. II, §1, cl. 3; Amdt. 12; 3 U. S. C. §15.

United States (2024)
    
    - `It is ultimately the Government’s burden to rebut the presumption of immunity. We therefore remand to the District Court to assess in the first instance, with appropriate input from the parties, whether a prosecution involving Trump’s alleged attempts to influence the Vice President’s oversight of the certification proceeding in his capacity as President of the Senate would pose any dangers of intrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch.` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024)
    
    - `Congress may prescribe when the state-appointed electors shall meet, and it counts and certifies their votes. Art. II, §1, cls. 3, 4. The President, meanwhile, plays no direct role in the process, nor does he have authority to control the state officials who do. And the Framers, wary of “cabal, intrigue and corruption,” specifically excluded from service as electors “all those who from situation might be suspected of too great devotion to the president in office.” The Federalist No. 68, at 459 (A. Hamilton); see Art. II, §1, cl. 2.` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024)
    
    - `Unlike Trump’s alleged interactions with the Justice Department, this alleged conduct cannot be neatly categorized as falling within a particular Presidential function. The necessary analysis is instead fact specific, requiring assessment of numerous alleged interactions with a wide variety of state officials and private persons. And the parties’ brief comments at oral argument indicate that they starkly disagree on the characterization of these allegations. The concerns we noted at the outset—the expedition of this case, the lack of factual analysis by the lower courts, and the absence of pertinent briefing by the parties—thus become more prominent. We accordingly remand to the District Court to determine in the first instance—with the benefit of briefing we lack—whether Trump’s conduct in this area qualifies as official or unofficial.` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024)
    
    - `Indeed, a long-recognized aspect of Presidential power is using the office’s “bully pulpit” to persuade Americans, including by speaking forcefully or critically, in ways that the President believes would advance the public interest. He is even expected to comment on those matters of public concern that may not directly implicate the activities of the Federal Government—for instance, to comfort the Nation in the wake of an emergency or tragedy. For these reasons, most of a President’s public communications are likely to fall comfortably within the outer perimeter of his official responsibilities.` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024)
    
    - `The indictment reflects these challenges. It includes only select Tweets and brief snippets of the speech Trump delivered on the morning of January 6, omitting its full text or context. See App. 228–230, Indictment ¶104. Whether the Tweets, that speech, and Trump’s other communications on January 6 involve official conduct may depend on the content and context of each. Knowing, for instance, what else was said contemporaneous to the excerpted communications, or who was involved in transmitting the electronic communications and in organizing the rally, could be relevant to the classification of each communication. This necessarily factbound analysis is best performed initially by the District Court. We therefore remand to the District Court to determine in the first instance whether this alleged conduct is official or unofficial.` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024)
    
    - `The implication of Trump’s theory is that a President who evades impeachment for one reason or another during his term in office can never be held accountable for his criminal acts in the ordinary course of law. So if a President manages to conceal certain crimes throughout his Presidency, or if Congress is unable to muster the political will to impeach the President for his crimes, then they must forever remain impervious to prosecution. Impeachment is a political process by which Congress can remove a President who has committed “Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.” Art. II, §4. Transforming that political process into a necessary step in the enforcement of criminal law finds little support in the text of the Constitution or the structure of our Government.` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024)
    
    - `As for the dissents, they strike a tone of chilling doom that is wholly disproportionate to what the Court actually does today—conclude that immunity extends to official discussions between the President and his Attorney General, and then remand to the lower courts to determine “in the first instance” whether and to what extent Trump’s remaining alleged conduct is entitled to immunity. Supra, at 24, 28, 30.  
    -   
    - The principal dissent’s starting premise—that unlike Speech and Debate Clause immunity, no constitutional text supports Presidential immunity, see post, at 4–6 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.)—is one that the Court rejected decades ago as “unpersuasive.” Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 750, n. 31; see also Nixon, 418 U. S., at 705–706, n. 16 (rejecting unanimously a similar argument in the analogous executive privilege context). “[A] specific textual basis has not been considered a prerequisite to the recognition of immunity.”`

    - > (a) Although there is no blanket recognition of absolute immunity for all federal executive officials from liability for civil damages resulting from constitutional violations, certain officials -- such as judges and prosecutors -- because of the special nature of their responsibilities, require absolute exemption from liability.

    - `As the Court has previously noted, relevant historical evidence on the question of Presidential immunity is of a “fragmentary character.” Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 752, n. 31; see also Clinton, 520 U. S., at 696–697; cf. Youngstown, 343 U. S., at 634 (Jackson, J., concurring) (noting “the poverty of really useful and unambiguous authority applicable to concrete problems of executive power”). “[T]he most compelling arguments,” therefore, “arise from the Constitution’s separation of powers and the Judiciary’s historic understanding of that doctrine.” Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 752, n. 31.` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024)
    
    - `Our first President had such a perspective. In his Farewell Address, George Washington reminded the Nation that “a Government of as much vigour as is consistent with the perfect security of Liberty is indispensable.” 35 Writings of George Washington 226 (J. Fitzpatrick ed. 1940). A government “too feeble to withstand the enterprises of faction,” he warned, could lead to the “frightful despotism” of “alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by the spirit of revenge.” Id., at 226–227. And the way to avoid that cycle, he explained, was to ensure that government powers remained “properly distributed and adjusted.” Id., at 226.  
    -   
    - It is these enduring principles that guide our decision in this case. The President enjoys no immunity for his unofficial acts, and not everything the President does is official. The President is not above the law. But Congress may not criminalize the President’s conduct in carrying out the responsibilities of the Executive Branch under the Constitution. And the system of separated powers designed by the Framers has always demanded an energetic, independent Executive. The President therefore may not be prosecuted for exercising his core constitutional powers, and he is entitled, at a minimum, to a presumptive immunity from prosecution for all his official acts. That immunity applies equally to all occupants of the Oval Office, regardless of politics, policy, or party.`

    - > `All obstructions to the execution of the laws, all combinations and associations under whatever plausible character with the real design to direct, control, counteract, or awe the regular deliberation and action of the constituted authorities, are destructive of this fundamental principle and of fatal tendency. They serve to organize faction; to give it an artificial and extraordinary force; to put in the place of the delegated will of the nation the will of a party, often a small but artful and enterprising minority of the community; and, according to the alternate triumphs of different parties, to make the public administration the mirror of the ill concerted and incongruous projects of faction, rather than the organ of consistent and wholesome plans digested by common councils and modified by mutual interests.` [link](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-CDOC-106sdoc21/pdf/GPO-CDOC-106sdoc21.pdf) - Washington’s Farewell Address to the People of the United States

    - > `Towards the preservation of your government and the permanency of your present happy state, it is requisite not only that you steadily discountenance irregular oppositions to its acknowledged authority but also that you resist with care the spirit of innovation upon its principles, however specious the pretexts. One method of assault may be to effect in the forms of the Constitution alterations which will impair the energy of the system and thus to undermine what cannot be directly overthrown. In all the changes to which you may be invited, remember that time and habit are at least as necessary to fix the true character of governments as of other human institutions, that experience is the surest standard by which to test the real tendency of the existing constitution of a country, that facility in changes upon the credit of mere hypotheses and opinion exposes to perpetual change from the endless variety of hypotheses and opinion; and remember, especially, that for the efficient management of your common interests in a country so extensive as ours, a government of as much vigor as is consistent with the perfect security of liberty is indispensable; liberty itself will find in such a government, with powers properly distributed and adjusted, its surest guardian. It is indeed little else than a name, where the government is too feeble to withstand the enterprises of faction, to confine each member of the society within the limits prescribed by the laws, and to maintain all in the secure and tranquil enjoyment of the rights of person and property.` [link](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-CDOC-106sdoc21/pdf/GPO-CDOC-106sdoc21.pdf) - Washington’s Farewell Address to the People of the United States

But this leads at length to a more formal and permanent despotism.

    - Chief Justice John Roberts, writing the majority opinion
        - The president has three broad types of immunity claims
            - "Core powers" that only the executive/president can perform.
                - Actions taken here are granted **absolute immunity.**
            - "Official powers" or "Overlapping powers" where the president OR some other branch could perform them.
                - Actions taken here are given **presumptive immunity**, meaning the burden is on the Government to prove that immunity should not be granted in this particular case, by proving that prosecuting a particular presidential act must pose "no dangers of intrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch."
            - "Unofficial" actions
                - Actions taken here are granted **no criminal immunity**, Roberts says that these actions must be "manifestly or palpably beyond [their] authority."
        - Any immunity granted for any actions also means those actions cannot be reviewed even if they were used in the furtherance of another crime.
        - Rulings on 4 major allegations brought up in the Opinion
            - Conversation between Trump and his Attorney General
                - The SC said this would be granted **absolute immunity**
            - Pressuring Pence to flip the electoral vote.
                - Granted **presumptive immunity**
            - Conversations with state officials to flip their electoral votes.
                - Remanded to the lower courts to argue about what kind of actions these were.
            - Speech made on January 6th to rally supporters to march on the capitol
                - Remanded to the lower courts to argue about what kind of actions these were
- Justice Thomas Concurring Opinion
    
    - `Few things would threaten our constitutional order more than criminally prosecuting a former President for his official acts. Fortunately, the Constitution does not permit us to chart such a dangerous course. As the Court forcefully explains, the Framers “deemed an energetic executive essential to . . . the security of liberty,” and our “system of separated powers” accordingly insulates the President from prosecution for his official acts.` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024)
    - 
    - > `There is an idea, which is not without its advocates, that a vigorous Executive is inconsistent with the genius of republican government. The enlightened well-wishers to this species of government must at least hope that the supposition is destitute of foundation; since they can never admit its truth, without at the same time admitting the condemnation of their own principles. Energy in the Executive is a leading character in the definition of good government. It is essential to the protection of the community against foreign attacks; it is not less essential to the steady administration of the laws; to the protection of property against those irregular and high-handed combinations which sometimes interrupt the ordinary course of justice; to the security of liberty against the enterprises and assaults of ambition, of faction, and of anarchy. Every man the least conversant in Roman story, knows how often that republic was obliged to take refuge in the absolute power of a single man, under the formidable title of Dictator, as well against the intrigues of ambitious individuals who aspired to the tyranny, and the seditions of whole classes of the community whose conduct threatened the existence of all government, as against the invasions of external enemies who menaced the conquest and destruction of Rome.  
    - >   
    - > There can be no need, however, to multiply arguments or examples on this head. A feeble Executive implies a feeble execution of the government. A feeble execution is but another phrase for a bad execution; and a government ill executed, whatever it may be in theory, must be, in practice, a bad government.`

    - 
    - > `But one of the weightiest objections to a plurality in the Executive, and which lies as much against the last as the first plan, is, that it tends to conceal faults and destroy responsibility. Responsibility is of two kinds to censure and to punishment. The first is the more important of the two, especially in an elective office. Man, in public trust, will much oftener act in such a manner as to render him unworthy of being any longer trusted, than in such a manner as to make him obnoxious to legal punishment. But the multiplication of the Executive adds to the difficulty of detection in either case. It often becomes impossible, amidst mutual accusations, to determine on whom the blame or the punishment of a pernicious measure, or series of pernicious measures, ought really to fall. It is shifted from one to another with so much dexterity, and under such plausible appearances, that the public opinion is left in suspense about the real author. The circumstances which may have led to any national miscarriage or misfortune are sometimes so complicated that, where there are a number of actors who may have had different degrees and kinds of agency, though we may clearly see upon the whole that there has been mismanagement, yet it may be impracticable to pronounce to whose account the evil which may have been incurred is truly chargeable. "I was overruled by my council. The council were so divided in their opinions that it was impossible to obtain any better resolution on the point.'' These and similar pretexts are constantly at hand, whether true or false. And who is there that will either take the trouble or incur the odium, of a strict scrunity into the secret springs of the transaction? Should there be found a citizen zealous enough to undertake the unpromising task, if there happen to be collusion between the parties concerned, how easy it is to clothe the circumstances with so much ambiguity, as to render it uncertain what was the precise conduct of any of those parties?` [link](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed70.asp) - The Federalist Papers: No.70, Alexander Hamilton

    - For reasons I explain below, I do not join Part III–C of the Court’s opinion. The remainder of the opinion is consistent with my view that the Constitution prohibits Congress from criminalizing a President’s exercise of core Article II powers and closely related conduct. That said, I would have framed the underlying legal issues differently. The Court describes the President’s constitutional protection from certain prosecutions as an “immunity.” As I see it, that term is shorthand for two propositions: The President can challenge the constitutionality of a criminal statute as applied to official acts alleged in the indictment, and he can obtain interlocutory review of the trial court’s ruling.`

    - `If the statute covers the alleged official conduct, the prosecution may proceed only if applying it in the circumstances poses no “ ‘dange[r] of intrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch.’ ” Ante, at 14 (quoting Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 731, 754 (1982)). On remand, the lower courts will have to apply that standard to various allegations involving the President’s official conduct.` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024)
    - 
    - > `This analysis is unnecessary for allegations involving the President’s private conduct because the Constitution offers no protection from prosecution of acts taken in a private capacity. Ante, at 15. Sorting private from official conduct sometimes will be difficult—but not always. Take the President’s alleged attempt to organize alternative slates of electors. See, e.g., App. 208. In my view, that conduct is private and therefore not entitled to protection. See post, at 27–28 (SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting). The Constitution vests power to appoint Presidential electors in the States. Art. II, §1, cl. 2; see also Chiafalo v. Washington, 591 U. S. 578, 588–589 (2020). And while Congress has a limited role in that process, see Art. II, §1, cls. 3–4, the President has none. In short, a President has no legal authority—and thus no official capacity—to influence how the States appoint their electors. I see no plausible argument for barring prosecution of that alleged conduct.` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024)
    
    - `The Constitution does not insulate Presidents from criminal liability for official acts. But any statute regulating the exercise of executive power is subject to a constitutional challenge. See, e.g., Collins v. Yellen, 594 U. S. 220, 235236 (2021); Zivotofsky v. Clinton, 566 U. S. 189, 192–194 (2012); Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd., 561 U. S. 477, 487–488 (2010). A criminal statute is no exception. Thus, a President facing prosecution may challenge the constitutionality of a criminal statute as applied to official acts alleged in the indictment. If that challenge fails, however, he must stand trial.` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024)
    
    - Amy Coney Barrett, concurring in part
        - Barrett disagrees that official acts can't be probed or presented as evidence in a criminal trial, even if those particular acts would ordinarily be immune from criminal prosecution.
        - Barrett also doesn't seem to agree with an "expansive" view on the absolute immunity argument forwarded by Roberts, but instead seems to view "official conduct" with a much more narrow lens, citing the conversations Trump has with election officials as falling squarely into private conduct, whereas Roberts remanded those questions to the lower courts.
- Justice Sotomayor, Kagan, Jackson Dissenting Opinion
    
    - `First, the Framers clearly knew how to provide for immunity from prosecution. They did provide a narrow immunity for legislators in the Speech or Debate Clause. See Art. I, §6, cl. 1 (“Senators and Representatives . . . shall in all Cases, except Treason, Felony and Breach of the Peace, be privileged from Arrest during their Attendance at the Session of their respective Houses, and in going to and returning from the same; and for any Speech or Debate in either House, they shall not be questioned in any other Place”). They did not extend the same or similar immunity to Presidents.  
    -   
    - Second, “some state constitutions at the time of the Framing specifically provided ‘express criminal immunities’ to sitting governors.” Brief for Scholars of Constitutional Law as Amici Curiae 4 (quoting S. Prakash, Prosecuting and Punishing Our Presidents, 100 Tex. L. Rev. 55, 69 (2021)). The Framers chose not to include similar language in the Constitution to immunize the President. If the Framers “had wanted to create some constitutional privilege to shield the President . . . from criminal indictment,” they could have done so. Memorandum from R. Rotunda to K. Starr re: Indictability of the President 18 (May 13, 1998). They did not.`

    - `Third, insofar as the Constitution does speak to this question, it actually contemplates some form of criminal liability for former Presidents. The majority correctly rejects Trump’s argument that a former President cannot be prosecuted unless he has been impeached by the House and convicted by the Senate for the same conduct. See ante, at 32–34; Part IV–C, infra. The majority ignores, however, that the Impeachment Judgment Clause cuts against its own position. That Clause presumes the availability of criminal process as a backstop by establishing that an official impeached and convicted by the Senate “shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.” Art. I, §3, cl. 7 (emphasis added). That Clause clearly contemplates that a former President may be subject to criminal prosecution for the same conduct that resulted (or could have resulted) in an impeachment judgment—including conduct such as “Bribery,” Art. II, §4, which implicates official acts almost by definition.` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024)
    
    - `At the Constitutional Convention, James Madison, who was aware that some state constitutions provided governors immunity, proposed that the Convention “conside[r] what privileges ought to be allowed to the Executive.” 2 Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, p. 503 (M. Farrand ed. 1911). There is no record of any such discussion. Ibid. Delegate Charles Pinckney later explained that “[t]he Convention which formed the Constitution well knew” that “no subject had been more abused than privilege,” and so it “determined to . . . limi[t] privilege to what was necessary, and no more.” 3 id., at 385. “No privilege . . . was intended for [the] Executive.”` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024)
    - 
    - > `To note, as the majority does, see ante, at 39, that this Court has recognized civil immunities arguably inconsistent with this view is not to say that Pinckney was wrong about what the Framers had “intended.” Indeed, Pinckney’s contemporaries shared the same view during the ratification debates. See, e.g., 4 Debates on the Constitution 109 (J. Elliot ed. 1836) (J. Iredell) (“If the President does a single act by which the people are prejudiced, he is punishable himself. . . . If he commits any crime, he is punishable by the laws of his country”).` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024)
    - 
    - > `No man has an authority to injure another with impunity. No man is better than his fellow-citizens, nor can pretend to any superiority over the meanest man in the country. If the President does a single act by which the people are prejudiced, he is punishable himself, and no other man merely to screen him. If he commits any misdemeanor in office, he is impeachable, removable from office, and incapacitated to hold any office of honor, trust, or profit. If he commits any crime, he is punishable by the laws of his country, and in capital cases may be deprived of his life. This being the case, there is not the same reason here for having a council which exists in England. It is, however, much to be desired, that a man who has such extensive and important business to perform should have the means of some assistance to enable him to discharge his arduous employment. The advice of the principal executive officers, which he can at all times command, will, in my opinion, answer this valuable purpose. He can at no time want advice, if he desires it, as the principal officers will always be on the spot. Those officers, from their abilities and experience, will probably be able to give as good, if not better, advice than any counsellors would do; and the solemnity of the advice in writing, which must be preserved, would be a great check upon them.` [link](https://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a2_2_1s13.html) - James Iredell, Debates on the Constitution 109
    
    - `This historical evidence reinforces that, from the very beginning, the presumption in this Nation has always been that no man is free to flout the criminal law. The majority fails to recognize or grapple with the lack of historical evidence for its new immunity. With nothing on its side of the ledger, the most the majority can do is claim that the historical evidence is a wash. See ante, at 38–39. It claims that the Court previously has described the “relevant historical evidence on the question of Presidential immunity” as “ ‘fragmentary’” and not worthy of consideration. Ante, at 38 (quoting Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 752, n. 31). Yet the Court has described only the evidence regarding “the President’s immunity from damages liability” as “fragmentary.” Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 751–752, n. 31 (emphasis added). Moreover, far from dismissing that evidence as irrelevant, the Fitzgerald Court was careful to note that “[t]he best historical evidence clearly support[ed]” the immunity from damages liability that it recognized, and it relied in part on that historical evidence to overcome the lack of any textual basis for its immunity. Id., at 152, n. 31. The majority ignores this reliance. It seems history matters to this Court only when it is convenient. See, e.g., New York State Rifle & Pistol Assn., Inc. v. Bruen, 597 U. S. 1 (2022); Dobbs, 597 U. S. 215.` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024)
    
    - `Consider Watergate, for example. After the Watergate tapes revealed President Nixon’s misuse of official power to obstruct the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s investigation of the Watergate burglary, President Ford pardoned Nixon. Both Ford’s pardon and Nixon’s acceptance of the pardon necessarily “rested on the understanding that the former President faced potential criminal liability.” Brief for United States 15; see also Public Papers of the Presidents, Gerald R. Ford, Vol. 1, Sept. 8, 1974, p. 103 (1975) (granting former President Nixon a “full, free, and absolute pardon . . . for all offenses against the United States which he . . . has committed or may have committed or taken part in during” his Presidency); R. Nixon, Statement by Former President Richard Nixon to P. Buchen, Counsel to President Ford, p. 1 (Sept. 8, 1974) (accepting “full and absolute pardon for any charges which might be brought against me for actions taken during the time I was President of the United States”).` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024)
    
    - `Indeed, Trump’s own lawyers during his second impeachment trial assured Senators that declining to impeach Trump for his conduct related to January 6 would not leave him “in any way above the law.” 2 Proceedings of the U. S. Senate in the Impeachment Trial of Donald John Trump, S. Doc. 117–2, p. 144 (2021). They insisted that a former President “is like any other citizen and can be tried in a court of law.” Ibid.; see also 1 id., S. Doc. 117–3, at 339 (Trump’s impeachment counsel stating that “no former officeholder is immune” from the judicial process “for investigation, prosecution, and punishment”); id., at 322–323 (Trump’s impeachment counsel stating: “If my colleagues on this side of the Chamber actually think that President Trump committed a criminal offense . . . [a]fter he is out of office, you go and arrest him”). Now that Trump is facing criminal charges for those acts, though, the tune has changed. Being treated “like any other citizen” no longer seems so appealing.` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024)
    
    - `the majority announces that former Presidents are “absolute[ly],” or “at least . . . presumptive[ly],” immune from criminal prosecution for all of their official acts. Ante, at 14 (emphasis omitted). The majority purports to keep us in suspense as to whether this immunity is absolute or presumptive, but it quickly gives up the game. It explains that, “[a]t a minimum, the President must . . . be immune from prosecution for an official act unless the Government can show that applying a criminal prohibition to that act would pose no ‘dangers of intrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch.’ ” Ibid. (emphasis added). No dangers, none at all. It is hard to imagine a criminal prosecution for a President’s official acts that would pose no dangers of intrusion on Presidential authority in the majority’s eyes. Nor should that be the standard. Surely some intrusions on the Executive may be “justified by an overriding need to promote objectives within the constitutional authority of Congress.” Nixon v. Administrator of General Services, 433 U. S. 425, 443 (1977). Other intrusions may be justified by the “primary constitutional duty of the Judicial Branch to do justice in criminal prosecutions.” United States v. Nixon, 418 U. S. 683, 707 (1974). According to the majority, however, any incursion on Executive power is too much. When presumptive immunity is this conclusive, the majority’s indecision as to “whether [official-acts] immunity must be absolute” or whether, instead, “presumptive immunity is sufficient,” ante, at 6, hardly matters.` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024)
    
    - `Quick on the heels of announcing this astonishingly broad official-acts immunity, the majority assures us that a former President can still be prosecuted for “unofficial acts.” Ante, at 15. Of course he can. No one has questioned the ability to prosecute a former President for unofficial (otherwise known as private) acts. Even Trump did not claim immunity for such acts and, as the majority acknowledges, such an immunity would be impossible to square with Clinton v. Jones, 520 U. S. 681 (1997). See ante, at 15. This unremarkable proposition is no real limit on today’s decision. It does not hide the majority’s embrace of the most far-reaching view of Presidential immunity on offer.  
    -   
    - In fact, the majority’s dividing line between “official” and “unofficial” conduct narrows the conduct considered “unofficial” almost to a nullity. It says that whenever the President acts in a way that is “ ‘not manifestly or palpably beyond [his] authority,’ ” he is taking official action. Ante, at 17 (quoting Blassingame v. Trump, 87 F. 4th 1, 13 (CADC 2023)). It then goes a step further: “In dividing official from unofficial conduct, courts may not inquire into the President’s motives.” Ante, at 18. It is one thing to say that motive is irrelevant to questions regarding the scope of civil liability, but it is quite another to make it irrelevant to questions regarding criminal liability. Under that rule, any use of official power for any purpose, even the most corrupt purpose indicated by objective evidence of the most corrupt motives and intent, remains official and immune. Under the majority’s test, if it can be called a test, the category of Presidential action that can be deemed “unofficial” is destined to be vanishingly small.  
    -   
    - Ultimately, the majority pays lip service to the idea that “[t]he President, charged with enforcing federal criminal laws, is not above them,” ante, at 13–14, but it then proceeds to place former Presidents beyond the reach of the federal criminal laws for any abuse of official power.`  
    - [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024)
    
    - `In the context of a federal criminal prosecution of a former President, however, the danger to the functioning of the Executive Branch is much reduced. Further, as every member of the Fitzgerald Court acknowledged, see Part IVB–2, infra, the public interest in a criminal prosecution is far weightier. Applying the Fitzgerald balancing here should yield the opposite result. Instead, the majority elides any difference between civil and criminal immunity, granting Trump the same immunity from criminal prosecution that Nixon enjoyed from an unlawful termination suit. That is plainly wrong.` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024)
    
    - `Indeed, a former President is likely to have legal arguments that would be unavailable to the average criminal defendant. For example, he may be able to rely on a public-authority exception from particular criminal laws,3 or an advice-of-the-Attorney-General defense, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 107–108.4` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf) - Trump v. United States (2024)
    
    - `If the case nonetheless makes it to trial, the Government will bear the burden of proving every element of the alleged crime beyond a reasonable doubt to a unanimous jury of the former President’s fellow citizens. See United States v. Gaudin, 515 U. S. 506, 510 (1995). If the Government manages to overcome even that significant hurdle, then the former President can appeal his conviction, and the appellate review of his claims will be “ ‘particularly meticulous.’ ” Trump v. Vance, 591 U. S. 786, 809 (2020) (quoting Nixon, 418 U. S., at 702). He can ultimately seek this Court’s review, and if past practice (including in this case) is any indication, he will receive it.  
    -   
    - In light of these considerable protections, the majority’s fear that “ ‘bare allegations of malice,’ ” ante, at 18 (alteration omitted), would expose former Presidents to trial and conviction is unfounded. Bare allegations of malice would not make it out of the starting gate. Although a private civil action may be brought based on little more than “ ‘intense feelings,’ ” ante, at 11 (quoting Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 752), a federal criminal prosecution is made of firmer stuff. Certainly there has been, on occasion, great feelings of animosity between incoming and outgoing Presidents over the course of our country’s history. Yet it took allegations as grave as those at the center of this case to have the first federal criminal prosecution of a former President. That restraint is telling.  
    -   
    - Third, because of longstanding interpretations by the Executive Branch, every sitting President has so far believed himself under the threat of criminal liability after his term in office and nevertheless boldly fulfilled the duties of his office. The majority insists that the threat of criminal sanctions is “more likely to distort Presidential decisionmaking than the potential payment of civil damages.” Ante, at 13. If that is right, then that distortion has been shaping Presidential decisionmaking since the earliest days of the Republic. Although it makes sense to avoid “diversion of the President’s attention during the decisionmaking process” with “needless worry,” Clinton, 520 U. S., at 694, n. 19, one wonders why requiring some small amount of his attention (or his legal advisers’ attention) to go towards complying with federal criminal law is such a great burden. If the President follows the law that he must “take Care” to execute, Art. II, §3, he has not been rendered “ ‘unduly cautious,’ ” ante, at 10 (quoting Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 752, n. 32). Some amount of caution is necessary, after all. It is a far greater danger if the President feels empowered to violate federal criminal law, buoyed by the knowledge of future immunity. I am deeply troubled by the idea, inherent in the majority’s opinion, that our Nation loses something valuable when the President is forced to operate within the confines of federal criminal law.`

    - Sonia Sotomayor, with whom Elena Kagan and Kentaji Jackson join, dissenting
        - Sotomayor argues in five parts
            - That the immunity is legally and historically inconsistent
                - Some state constitution actually did provide for criminal immunity for sitting governors, this was not included in the US Constitution.
                - Art I §3 C7 gives us the "_nevertheless_" for criminal prosecution, and things like bribery are official acts for which one can be impeached, so any citations of this part of the Constitution seem to imply that criminalizing official conduct was textually supported by the Constitution.
                - Sotomayor makes reference to other historical arguments that support the criminal charging of public officials acting in their official capacity.
            - That it is "deeply wrong"
            - That the "core" immunity is misguided and not needed
                - The difference between an official and unofficial act and the inability to probe motives or intents of anything that can be even slightly construed as an official act essentially nullifies almost all criminal law from applying to almost all presidential actions.
                - The civil vs criminal balancing test is not appropriately applied, since the public has a greater interest in criminal prosecution than it does in private suits, the executive branch should need to provide a greater reason, not a lesser one, to evade such liability.
            - The evidentiary holding is unprecedented
            - And that the ruling will have disastrous consequences
        - There are many more safeguards and protections built into criminal suits vs private action.
        - The court, even though it rejected Trump's arguments that impeachment must precede any criminal indictment, actually grants more immunity by claiming even actions by which a president is impeached for cannot be criminal charged.
        - Sotomayor challenges the logic that juries might be biased against a president's "official-acts" due to their bias against their administration, however, that same logic would likely extend to literally every single act of a president, including non-official acts for other private suits.
        - Roberts remanded 3 actions back to the lower courts for analysis, but for some reason thought it appropriate to declare the conversations Trump had with the AG as qualifying for absolute immunity with zero lower court consideration or analysis first.
        - She points out that Roberts goes further than what the defendants were even asking for, noting that even when they've conceded some acts as private, Roberts is saying they may not be.

        - Says that majority claims that the president must commit crimes in order to do his job.
        - She points out that the Judges and Prosecutors themselves must assume a role of quasi-jury, judging whether a particular action was official or criminal in nature before any trial has even begun.
        - This ruling has allowed the court to snatch power from the Legislature and give it to the Court and the Executive, as they are now making determinations of who the law applies to.
        - "Core powers" aren't even very well defined in the Constitution.

- The Conclusions
    
    - `This report has documented the payment of many millions of dollars in unconstitutional emoluments to Trump-owned businesses from at least 20 foreign governments as well as entities and lobbyists acting on their behalf. As noted, given the incompleteness of the documents received by the Committee and Chairman Comer’s decision to act in concert with former President Trump’s attorneys to block the production of additional records, this total is likely but a small fraction of the full universe of foreign emolument spending that took place during the Trump presidency in violation of the U.S. Constitution.  
    -   
    - President Trump’s pervasive use of the presidency for personal financial gain is particularly alarming given not only the significant dollar amounts and multiplicity of countries involved, but also former President Trump’s repeated indications of his willingness to allow his personal financial interest to dictate policy decisions he made as President. The rich profits that Trump businesses reaped from those countries, at best, leaves subject to question whether the often favorable treatment they received from the Trump Administration resulted from the former President’s bona fide judgment about advancing the vital interests of the United States, or his desire to perpetuate the substantial personal enrichment he enjoyed from the lavish emolument spending by those countries.  
    -   
    - As he accepted these payments, Mr. Trump ignored the Foreign Emolument Clause’s explicit requirement that he obtain congressional authorization before pocketing such gifts—never even seeking, let alone securing, the consent of Congress to his receipt of these large-scale emoluments. No president has ever come so close to brazenly ignoring the Foreign Emoluments Clause.  
    -   
    - These facts demonstrate the need for urgent congressional action to prevent future presidents and senior officials from serving under similarly grave conflicts of interest and unconstitutional arrangements. Accordingly, this report recommends that Congress expeditiously consider adopting measures that would require presidents and senior executive officials to disclose to Congress their receipt of any foreign emoluments, set forth an explicit procedure for presidents and senior officials to seek the requisite congressional authorization for the receipt and retention of emoluments, and require the disclosure of payments to entities in which a sitting president has a financial interest “of any kind whatever” by officials and lobbyists acting on behalf of kings, princes, and foreign governments.`
