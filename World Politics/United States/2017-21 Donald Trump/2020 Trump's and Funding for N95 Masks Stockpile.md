### 2020 Trump's and Funding for N95 Masks Stockpile
- Trump stated on April 6, 2020 in a White House briefing The Obama administration left Trump with a `stockpile with a cupboard that was bare.` The director of the national stockpile described it as an $8 billion enterprise in November. While the stockpile had a lot of goods, it didnâ€™t have all the needed supplies for the nationwide 2020 pandemic. Reports show that N95 masks were depleted as a result of H1N1 in 2009, and experts warned they should be replenished. Budget figures going back to 2009 show overall funding for the stockpile dropped to its lowest in 2013, to about $477 million. Allocations have grown steadily since then to a 2020 budget of $705 million. [link](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/apr/08/donald-trump/trump-said-obama-admin-left-him-bare-stockpile-wro/)
