### Pre-Election
- On 7 April 2020, President Trump first made suggestions to the media that widespread electoral fraud would occur during the 2020 Election especially through the use of mail-in ballots.
    
    - `"Mail ballots — they cheat. OK? People cheat," he said April 7. "There's a lot of dishonesty going along with mail-in voting."`  
    -   
    - ...  
    -   
    - `"Mail ballots are a very dangerous thing for this country, because they're cheaters. They go and collect them. They're fraudulent in many cases,” Trump said April 7.`

- On 8 April 2020, President Trump tweeted in response to the Republican silence accusing Democrats of stoking voter fraud
    
    - `Republicans should fight very hard when it comes to state wide mail-in voting. Democrats are clamoring for it. Tremendous potential for voter fraud, and for whatever reason, doesn’t work out well for Republicans. @foxandfriends` [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20200408122052/https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1247861952736526336)
    
- On 8 April 2020, President Trump tweeted about the alleged difference in Absentee Ballots and Mail-In Ballots.
    
    - `Absentee Ballots are a great way to vote for the many senior citizens, military, and others who can’t get to the polls on Election Day. These ballots are very different from 100% Mail-In Voting, which is “RIPE for FRAUD,” and shouldn’t be allowed!` [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20200531223135/https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1248031484532928514)
    
- On 11 April 2020, President Trump tweeted,
    
    - `Mail in ballots substantially increases the risk of crime and VOTER FRAUD!` [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20200902054032/https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1249132374547464193)
    
- On 19 July 2020, Trump refused to say whether he would accept the results of the election and commit to a peaceful transition of power if he lost.
    
    - `In the “Fox News Sunday” interview, Wallace asked Trump whether he considers himself a “gracious” loser. Trump replied that he doesn’t like to lose, then added: “It depends. I think mail-in voting is going to rig the election. I really do.” Trump’s comment echoed unfounded claims he has made in recent weeks that mail-in voting is susceptible to widespread fraud. “Are you suggesting that you might not accept the results of the election?” Wallace asked. Trump responded, “No. I have to see.” Later in the interview, pressed on whether he will accept the results of the November election, Trump again declined to say.` [link](https://archive.ph/CItzx)
    
- On 12 August 2020, the House of Representatives voted for a $25 billion grant to the U.S. Postal Service for the expected surge in mail voting, Trump blocked funding, saying he wanted to prevent any increase in voting by mail.
    
    - `Trump, who has been railing against mail-in balloting for months, said the cash-strapped agency’s enlarged role in the November election would perpetuate “one of the greatest frauds in history.” Speaking Wednesday at his daily pandemic news briefing, Trump said he would not approve $25 billion in emergency funding for the Postal Service, or $3.5 billion in supplemental funding for election resources, citing prohibitively high costs. “They don’t have the money to do the universal mail-in voting. So therefore, they can’t do it, I guess,” Trump said. “Are they going to do it even if they don’t have the money?”` [link](https://archive.ph/Ug1yL)
    
- On 23 September 2020, Trump again refused to say whether he would accept the results of the election and commit to a peaceful transition of power if he lost.
    
    - `"Well, we're going to have to see what happens," Trump said when asked whether he'd commit to a peaceful transition, one of the cornerstones of American democracy.  
    -   
    - ...  
    -   
    - "You know that I've been complaining very strongly about the ballots and the ballots are a disaster," Trump said at a press briefing at the White House,  
    -   
    - ...  
    -   
    - "(G)et rid of the ballots and you'll have a very ... there won't be a transfer, frankly. There'll be a continuation," he added, saying "the ballots are out of control."`

- On 24 Septem­ber 2020, The FBI Director, Chris­topher Wray, before the U.S. Senate Commit­tee on Home­land Secur­ity and Government Affairs said that:
    
    - `We have not seen, histor­ic­ally, any kind of coordin­ated national voter fraud effort in a major elec­tion, whether it’s by mail or other­wise.` [[fbihasnotseenevidenceofwidespreadvot]]
    
- On 30 October 2020, President Trump tweeted,
    
    - `The Election should end on November 3rd., not weeks later!` [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20201030214840/https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1322294301183782912)
    
### Peri-Election
- On 3 November 2020, Election Day starts.
- On 4 & 5 November 2020, More than 200 Trump supporters protest at a Maricopa County, Arizona elections center and around downtown Phoenix, claiming some ballots have not been properly counted.
    
    - `Tensions are running high outside of the Maricopa County Elections office in Phoenix, Ariz., where more than a hundred protestors have demonstrated for the last three nights to argue about the electoral process after former Vice President Joe Biden became the front-runner in the traditionally red state.` [link](https://time.com/5908628/maricopa-county-arizona-protests/)
    
- On 5 November 2020, Trump Tweeted:
    
    - `STOP THE COUNT!` [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20201105153104/https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1324353932022480896)
    
- On 5 November 2020, Trump Tweeted:
    
    - `STOP THE FRAUD!` [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20201105183250/https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1324401527663058944)
    
- On 5 November 2020, Trump claimed that the election was being stolen from him.
    
    - `“If you count the legal votes, I easily win. If you count the illegal votes, they can try to steal the election from us. If you count the votes that came in late, we’re looking at them very strongly,” Trump told reporters.  
    -   
    - ...  
    -   
    - “Media polling was election interference, in the truest sense of that word by powerful special interests. These, really, phony polls … were designed to keep our voters at home, create the illusion of momentum for Mr. Biden and diminish republicans ability to raise funds. They were what’s called suppression polls,” Trump said.`

- On 7 November 2020, AP news called the 2020 Election in favour of Joe Biden.
    
    - `On Saturday, Biden captured the presidency when The Associated Press declared him the victor in his native Pennsylvania at 11:25 a.m. EST. That got him the state’s 20 electoral votes, which pushed him over the 270 electoral-vote threshold needed to prevail.` [link](https://apnews.com/article/why-did-AP-call-election-for-Biden-fe79276cd9175fffc7cf4fb58045fcf9)
    
### Post-Election
- On 9 November 2020, The administrator of the General Services Administration refuses to sign a letter allowing Biden's transition team to formally begin work, reflecting Trump's position of not conceding yet.
    
    - `A Trump administration appointee is refusing to sign a letter allowing President-elect Joe Biden’s transition team to formally begin its work this week, in another sign the incumbent president has not acknowledged Biden’s victory and could disrupt the transfer of power.` [link](https://archive.ph/HfGpV)
    
- On 12 November 2020, The Trump-Appointed Commis­sioner of the U.S. Elec­tion Assist­ance Commis­sion, Benjamin Hovland said that,
    
    - `You know, we've seen allegations like this before, and essentially, time and time again, when the rubber hits the road, there's no evidence — whether that's in court cases, whether that's in the presidential commission that was created in 2017 to find the alleged non-citizens fraud after the 2016 election that cost, in his mind, the president the popular vote, but found nothing and disbanded in embarrassment, or academic studies. We never see evidence of widespread voter fraud. And there's no indicators that 2020 will be different in that regard.` [link](https://www.businessinsider.com/nations-chief-election-administrator-calls-trumps-voting-fraud-claims-shameful-2020-11?r=US&IR=T)
    
- On 12 November 2020, The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency released the following statement:
    
    - `“The November 3rd election was the most secure in American history. Right now, across the country, election officials are reviewing and double checking the entire election process prior to finalizing the result. “When states have close elections, many will recount ballots. All of the states with close results in the 2020 presidential race have paper records of each vote, allowing the ability to go back and count each ballot if necessary. This is an added benefit for security and resilience. This process allows for the identification and correction of any mistakes or errors. There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised. “Other security measures like pre-election testing, state certification of voting equipment, and the U.S. Election Assistance Commission’s (EAC) certification of voting equipment help to build additional confidence in the voting systems used in 2020. “While we know there are many unfounded claims and opportunities for misinformation about the process of our elections, we can assure you we have the utmost confidence in the security and integrity of our elections, and you should too. When you have questions, turn to elections officials as trusted voices as they administer elections.”` [link](https://www.cisa.gov/news/2020/11/12/joint-statement-elections-infrastructure-government-coordinating-council-election)
    
- On 11 December 2020, Attorney General William Barr said to AP news that there is no evidence of widespread election fraud that Trump is claiming.
    
    - `Although Justice’s U.S. attorneys and FBI agents had been working to follow up specific complaints they’d received, Barr told Balsamo: “To date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election.” The Dec. 1 statement was a direct contradiction to Trump and his allies who have kept up baseless arguments about a rigged election, despite the electoral college tally and popular vote loss to Democrat Joe Biden.` [link](https://leads.ap.org/best-of-the-week/exclusive-interview-with-attorney-general-barr-nets-massive-scoop)
    
- On 2 January 2021, during an hour-long conference call, Trump pressured Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to change the state's election results citing that Trump wanted to find 11,780 votes.
    
    - `Now the problem is they need more time for the big numbers. But they’re very substantial numbers. But I think you’re going to find that they — by the way, a little information — I think you’re going to find that they are shredding ballots because they have to get rid of the ballots because the ballots are unsigned. The ballots are corrupt, and they’re brand new, and they don’t have seals, and there’s a whole thing with the ballots. But the ballots are corrupt. And you are going to find that they are — which is totally illegal — it is more illegal for you than it is for them because, you know, what they did and you’re not reporting it. That’s a criminal, that’s a criminal offense. And you can’t let that happen. That’s a big risk to you and to Ryan, your lawyer. And that’s a big risk. But they are shredding ballots, in my opinion, based on what I’ve heard. And they are removing machinery, and they’re moving it as fast as they can, both of which are criminal finds. And you can’t let it happen, and you are letting it happen. You know, I mean, I’m notifying you that you’re letting it happen. So look. All I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have because we won the state.` [link](https://archive.ph/BMC7Q)
    
- Trump might have violated Title 52 of the United States Code when he said "I just want to find 11,780 votes” by trying to intimidating election officials to change the results
    
    - `The University of Richmond law professor Carl Tobias said Trump might be “in legal jeopardy after Biden is inaugurated”. In an email to the Guardian, he wrote: “For example, if the justice department or US attorneys believe that Trump violated federal law, or if local prosecutors in states such as Arizona, Georgia, Michigan and Wisconsin, where Trump may have engaged in similar behaviour with state or local election officials, believe that Trump violated state election laws, the federal or state prosecutors could file suit against Trump.” Richard H Pildes, a constitutional law professor at New York University, told the Washington Post: “The president is either knowingly attempting to coerce state officials into corrupting the integrity of the election or is so deluded that he believes what he’s saying.” Trump’s actions may have violated federal statutes, he said. Michael R Bromwich, a former federal prosecutor in the US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, wrote: “Unless there are portions of the tape that somehow negate criminal intent, ‘I just want to find 11,780 votes’ and his threats against Raffensperger and his counsel violate 52 U.S. Code 20511.”` [link](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/04/trumps-phone-call-to-brad-raffensperger-five-key-points)
    
    - 52 U.S. Code 20511 - `A person, including an election official, who in any election for Federal office— (1)knowingly and willfully intimidates, threatens, or coerces, or attempts to intimidate, threaten, or coerce, any person for— (A)registering to vote, or voting, or attempting to register or vote; (B)urging or aiding any person to register to vote, to vote, or to attempt to register or vote; or (C)exercising any right under this chapter; or (2)knowingly and willfully deprives, defrauds, or attempts to deprive or defraud the residents of a State of a fair and impartially conducted election process, by— (A)the procurement or submission of voter registration applications that are known by the person to be materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent under the laws of the State in which the election is held; or (B)the procurement, casting, or tabulation of ballots that are known by the person to be materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent under the laws of the State in which the election is held, shall be fined in accordance with title 18 (which fines shall be paid into the general fund of the Treasury, miscellaneous receipts (pursuant to section 3302 of title 31), notwithstanding any other law), or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both.` [link](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/52/20511)
    
- On 28 January 2021, The Federal Election Commission announced that Biden won the election on November 3 2020, receiving 81,268,924 votes (51.31%) to Trump's 74,216,154 (46.86%) and 306 Electoral College votes to Trump's 232.

### Intelligence Community Report
- On 15 March 2021, The Office of the Director of National Intelligence declassified and released a report on `Foreign Threats to the 2020 US Federal Elections`
    
    - `Throughout the election cycle, Russia's online influence actors sought to affect US public perceptions of the candidates, as well as advance Moscow's longstanding goals of undermining confidence in US election processes and increasing sociopolitical divisions among the American people. During the presidential primaries and dating back to 2019, these actors backed candidates from both major US political parties that Moscow viewed as outsiders, while later claiming that election fraud helped what they called "establishment" candidates. Throughout the election, Russia's online influence actors sought to amplify mistrust in the electoral process by denigrating mail-in ballots, highlighting alleged irregularities, and accusing the Democratic Party of voter fraud.  
    -   
    - The Kremlin-linked influence organization Project Lakhta and its Lakhta Internet Research (LIR) troll farm--commonly referred to by its former moniker Internet Research Agency (IRA)-amplified controversial domestic issues. LIR used social media personas, news websites, and US persons to deliver tailored content to subsets of the US population. LIR established short-lived troll farms that used unwitting third-country nationals in Ghana, Mexico, and Nigeria to propagate these US-focused narratives, probably in response to efforts by US companies and law enforcement to shut down UR-associated personas.  
    -   
    - Russian state media, trolls, and online proxies, including those directed by Russian intelligence, published disparaging content about President Biden, his family, and the Democratic Party, and heavily amplified related content circulating in US media, including stories centered on his son. These influence actors frequently sought out US contributors to increase their reach into US audiences. In addition to election-related content, these online influence actors also promoted conspiratorial narratives about the COVID-19 pandemic, made allegations of social media censorship, and highlighted US divisions surrounding protests about racial justice.  
    -   
    - Russian online influence actors generally promoted former President Trump and his commentary, including repeating his political messaging on the election results; the presidential campaign; debates; the impeachment inquiry; and, as the election neared, US domestic crises. Influence actors sometimes sought to discourage US left-leaning audiences from voting by suggesting that neither candidate was a preferable option. At the same time, Russian actors criticized former President Trump or his administration when they pursued foreign policies-such as the targeted killing of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in January 2020--at odds with Russia's preferences.  
    -   
    - LIR, which probably receives tasking and strategic direction from the Kremlin, pushed stories supporting former President Trump and denigrating President Biden after he became the presumptive nominee in April.`  
    - [link](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/20515484/icadeclass16mar21.pdf) - Foreign Threats to the 2020 US Federal Elections
    
    - `We assess that Russian leaders viewed President Biden's potential election as disadvantageous to Russian interests and that this drove their efforts to undermine his candidacy. We have high confidence in this assessment.  
    -   
    - Russian officials and state media frequently attacked President Biden for his leading role in the Obama administration's Ukraine policy and his support for the anti-Putin opposition in Russia, suggesting the Kremlin views him as part of a reflexively anti-Russia US foreign policy establishment. Putin probably also considers President Biden more apt to echo the idea of American "exceptionalism," which he and other Kremlin leaders have often publicly criticized as problematic and dangerous.  
    -   
    - Moscow's range of influence actors uniformly worked to denigrate President Biden after his entrance into the race. Throughout the primaries and general election campaign, Russian influence agents repeatedly spread unsubstantiated or misleading claims about President Biden and his family's alleged wrongdoing related to Ukraine. By contrast, during the Democratic primaries Russian online influence actors promoted candidates that Moscow viewed as outside what it perceives to be an anti-Russia political establishment.  
    -   
    - Even after the election, Russian online influence actors continued to promote narratives questioning the election results and disparaging President Biden and the Democratic Party. These efforts parallel plans Moscow had in place in 2016 to discredit a potential incoming Clinton administration, but which it scrapped after former President Trump's victory.`

- There was a total of 64 pre and post-election lawsuits in regards to Trump’s claims of voter integrity & fraud.
    
    - `Of the 64 cases brought by Trump and his supporters, twenty were dismissed before a hearing on the merits, fourteen were voluntarily dismissed by Trump and his supporters before a hearing on the merits, and 30 cases included a hearing on the merits. Only in one Pennsylvania case involving far too few votes to overturn the results did Trump and his supporters prevail.` [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aqorZ61AYFqZU-EDQBBzjqfvAoC5nKcB/view)
    
#### SCOTUS
##### Mike Kelly, et al. v. Pennsylvania, et al.
- On 3 December 2020, 28 Republican politicians, led by Rep. Mike Kelly, asked the US Supreme Court to block the certification of Pennsylvania's election results alleging that “no excuse” absentee voting law unlawfully expanded the scope of absentee voting. Plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order against certification while the courts ruled on the issue. [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/20-810.html)
- On 8 December 2020, The court turned down the case.
    
    - `First, Petitioners’ unjustifiable delay in filing suit not only supports the application of laches, but also weighs against issuing an injunction. Petitioners waited over a year after Act 77 passed—and then weeks after Election Day—to first bring their claims. Petitioners should not receive extraordinary relief after unduly delaying in a manner that created the very exigent circumstances that supposedly animate their rush to this Court.  
    -   
    - ...  
    -   
    - Second, the public interest in avoiding mass disenfranchisement of an entire state militates overwhelmingly against Petitioners’ request for relief. As Judge Sutton has explained, “[c]all it what you will—laches, the Purcell principle, or common sense—the idea is that courts will not disrupt imminent elections absent a powerful reason for doing so.”  
    -   
    - ...  
    -   
    - Finally, granting an injunction would sow chaos and confusion across the Nation while inflaming baseless concerns about electoral impropriety and ensnaring the Judiciary in partisan strife. This case reaches the Court against the backdrop of unfounded claims—which have been repeatedly rejected by state and federal courts— that wrongly impugn the integrity of the democratic process and aim to cast doubt on the legitimacy of its outcome. Given that context, the Court should not plunge itself into a firestorm by issuing the first ever judicial order decertifying the results of a presidential election. Instead, it should stay true to “the trust of a Nation that here, We the People rule.”  
    -   
    - ...  
    -   
    - Petitioner’s application for a writ of injunction should be denied.`

##### Texas v. Pennsylvania, et al.
- On 7 December 2020, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan, and Wisconsin in the US Supreme Court seeking to overturn their election results. [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/22o155.html)
- On 11 December 2020,The Supreme Court rejected the case.
    
    - `The State of Texas’s motion for leave to file a bill of complaint is denied for lack of standing under Article III of the Constitution. Texas has not demonstrated a judicially cognizable interest in the manner in which another State  
    - conducts its elections. All other pending motions are dismissed as moot.  
    -   
    - Statement of Justice Alito, with whom Justice Thomas joins: In my view, we do not have discretion to deny the filing of a bill of complaint in a case that falls within our original jurisdiction. ... . I would therefore grant the motion to file the bill of complaint but would not grant other relief, and I express no view on any other issue.`

### Donald J. Trump, v. Cyrus R. Vance, Jr., et al.
- On 13 October 2020, The Trump campaign asked the US Supreme Court to overturn three decisions from the Pennsylvania Supreme Court over various technical rules regarding absentee and mail-in ballots. [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/20a63.html)
- On 22 February 2021, The court rejected the case declaring it moot.
    
    - `First, Applicant contends that he will be irreparably harmed even if the relevant documents are disclosed only to the “grand jury and prosecutors.” Appl. 33. But the primary authority Applicant cites for that proposition, Church of Scientology of Cal. v. United States, 506 U.S. 9 (1992), suggests the opposite. There, the Court held that a party’s appeal of an order requiring it to produce records to the government does not become moot even after the party has produced those records.  
    -   
    - ...  
    -   
    - Second, Applicant claims irreparable harm from the possibility that his records may be “disclosed publicly” outside the grand jury. Appl. 33. But as noted, Applicant must show a “likelihood”—not a mere hypothetical possibility—“that irreparable harm will result from the denial of” relief. ... There is no likelihood that his records will become public, given the “presumption of confidentiality [that] attaches to the record of Grand Jury proceedings.”  
    -   
    - ...  
    -   
    - Finally, Applicant contends that the purported harm is “particularly pressing” because he “challenges a subpoena to a third party.” Appl. 34. But the subpoena’s issuance to a third party (Mazars) is immaterial because everyone agrees that it “is functionally a subpoena issued to the President.” ... That is why, throughout these proceedings, Mazars has taken “no position on the legal issues raised” and indicated that it would follow any court order.`

    - `The application for a stay presented to Justice Breyer and referred to the Court is denied.` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/022221zor_2cp3.pdf)
    
### Arizona
### Aguilera v. Fontes,
- On 4 November 2020, a voter, Laurie Aguilera, filed a lawsuit accusing Maricopa County that Votes cast using Sharpies were unlawfully excluded from election results.
    
    - `Plaintiff Laurie Aguilera voted in person in Maricopa County on election day, November 3, 2020. She was provided with a sharpie by the poll workers with which to mark her ballot. Plaintiff completed her ballot with the provided sharpie. While completing it she noticed that the ink was bleeding through. Plaintiff has been voting in person for several election cycles. However, upon information and belief, she has never before been given a sharpie as a marking device by a poll worker. Plaintiff fed her ballot into the ballot box. The ballot box failed to properly register her vote causing a poll-worker to cancel her ballot in the presence of Plaintiff.  
    - Plaintiff requested a new ballot but, upon information and belief, upon consultation with the Maricopa County Reorder's Office, the poll workers refused to provide her with one. Upon information and belief, many other voters have experienced similar issues.  
    - Upon information and belief not all Arizona counties and polling places provided in-person voters with sharpies for marking devices.`

- On 12 November 2020, a Second suit was brought by Aguilera, alleging her vote was not counted and asking for opportunity to cast a new ballot.
    
    - `Plaintiff Laurie Aguilera voted in person in Maricopa County on election day, November 3, 2020 alongside her husband Damian Aguilera. Neither Plaintiff Aguilera nor her husband are on the early voting list or received ballots by mail. Ex. B. [Aguilera family ballot status informationl. When election-day voters like Plaintiff Aguilera showed up to the polls, they were checked in by poll-workers on tablet-style devices and their names were then logged into the county's electronic pollbook. Plaintiff Aguilera and her husband were checked-in to the polls by a poll-worker. Plaintiff Aguilera completed her ballot according to the instructions provided by Defendants. Plaintiff Aguilera and her husband attempted to feed their ballots into the tabulator as instructed. Upon information and belief, when a ballot is successfully read and insetted into a tabulator, the tabulator displays a confirmation that the ballot has been accepted on a small digital readout.` [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20201116024331/https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/2020/11/CV2020-014562.pdf)
    
- On 29 November 2020, the State judge dismissed the case after an evidentiary hearing.
    
    - `Plaintiff Aguilera asserts that she was unable to successfully cast her ballot in person at the polls on 11/3/2020, Election Day. Aguilera testified that on Election Day, she and her husband Damian Aguilera went together to vote in person at the Sheraton Hotel at 26th Avenue and Dunlap in Phoenix. Aguilera's husband testified that he voted without incident just ahead of his wife. Aguilera testified that when she inserted her completed ballot into the tabulator machine, the tabulator screen did not ligtrt up or make any noise. Poll workers who came to assist Aguilera thought the tabulator looked as though it was ready to receive another ballot and told Aguilera she needed to vote again. When Aguilera began the process of doing so by scanning in her identification at the check-in kiosk, the kiosk indicated that she had already cast her ballot and gave her the option to cancel the ballot.` [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20201202180408/https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/2020/11/Final-Order-CV2020-014562-ME-11-30.pdf)
    
### Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. v. Hobbs. (Sharpie Lawsuit)
- On 7 November 2020, The Trump Campaign, Republican National Committee, and Arizona Republican Party alleged that Maricopa County elections officials violated state and federal law when overriding electronic tabulator errors for ballots rejected by an electronic tabulation device. [link](http://www.superiorcourt.maricopa.gov/docket/CivilCourtCases/caseInfo.asp?caseNumber=cv2020-014248)
- There is no evidence that using Sharpies leads to issues with scanning ballots and officials have said using Sharpies is preferred. Arizona's Secretary of State Katie Hobbs tweeted,
    
    - `IMPORTANT: If you voted a regular ballot in-person, your ballot will be counted, no matter what kind of pen you used (even a Sharpie)!` [link](https://twitter.com/SecretaryHobbs/status/1324074443740647425)
    
- The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, formed in 2018 by legislation Trump signed, has also labelled the conspiracy theory a false rumour.
    
    - `Election jurisdictions allow voters to mark ballots with varying types of writing instruments, based on state law and other considerations such as tabulation system requirements. Poll workers are required to provide approved writing devices to voters.  
    -   
    - Although felt-tip pens, like Sharpies, may bleed through ballots, some election officials have stated that ballot tabulation equipment in their jurisdictions can still read these ballots. Many jurisdictions even design their ballots with offset columns to prevent any potential bleed through from impacting the ability to easily scan both sides of ballots.  
    -   
    - If a ballot has issues that impact its ability to be scanned, it can be hand counted or duplicated, or adjudicated by election officials, who use defined procedures such as chain of custody to ensure protect ballot secrecy and integrity. Many states additionally have “voter intent” laws that allow for ballots to be counted even when issues such as bleed-throughs or stray marks are present, as long as the voter’s intent can still be determined.`

- On 10 November 2020, A Republican-aligned group abandoned the legal fight after Maricopa County officials challenged the factual basis for the lawsuit.
    
    - `This lawsuit is yet one more attempt by the President’s unsuccessful reelection campaign to alter the results of a properly administered general election—or, at the very least, to cast doubt, on the integrity of the election and the veracity of the results. But once again, Plaintiffs’ claims are unmoored from both law and fact, with allegations strung together by rank speculation and selective generalization. This Court should follow the lead of its sister jurisdictions across the country and dismiss this case.  
    -   
    - For the reasons stated above, Plaintiffs’ Complaint should be dismissed.`

- On 13 November 2020, the Trump campaign lost the fight soon afterward.
    
    - `Since the close of yesterday’s hearing, the tabulation of votes statewide has rendered unnecessary a judicial ruling as to the presidential electors.` [link](https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NoticeofPartialMootness-1.pdf)

### Kelli Ward v. Constance Jackson et al., and Katie Hobbs.
- On 30 November 2020, an Arizona voter and state Republican Party Chair, Kelli Ward, filed a lawsuit in the Superior Court of Arizona, Maricopa County. Ward challenged the signature verification process, claiming election workers were unfit to verify signatures. Ward also challenged the ballot duplication process, whereby bipartisan county workers transferred votes to new ballots when ballot tabulators could not read them, claiming that observers were not allowed to view the entire process. [link](https://www.azcourts.gov/newsandinfo/High-Profile-Case-Update/CV-20-0343)
- On 4 December 2020, Arizona's Superior Court of Maricopa County
    
    - `A.R.S. § 16-672(A)(5) permits an election contest on the ground that, “by reason of erroneous count of votes” the candidate certified as the winner “did not in fact receive the highest number of votes.” Plaintiff has not proven that the Biden/Harris ticket did not receive the highest number of votes.` [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20201230073802/https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/2020/11/Order-2.pdf)
    
- On 8 December 2020, Arizona's Supreme Court unanimously rejected the appeal of the Superior Court case saying the facts Ward presented were incorrect and that she "fails to present any evidence of misconduct."
    
    - `Intervenor Maricopa County argues that the trial court could not entertain this challenge under A.R.S. § 16-672(A) which authorizes a contest of the “election of any person declared elected to state office.” Intervenors/Defendants/Amicus contend that the Court must decide this matter within the “safe harbor” deadline of 3 U.S.C. § 5.  
    -   
    - The Court concludes, unanimously, that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in denying the request to continue the hearing and permit additional inspection of the ballots. The November 9, 2020 hand count audit revealed no discrepancies in the tabulation of votes and the statistically negligible error presented in this case falls far short of warranting relief under A.R.S. § 16-672. Because the challenge fails to present any evidence of “misconduct,” “illegal votes” or that the Biden Electors “did not in fact receive the highest number of votes for office,” let alone establish any degree of fraud or a sufficient error rate that would undermine the certainty of the election results, the Court need not decide if the challenge was in fact authorized under A.R.S. § 16-672 or if the federal “safe harbor” deadline applies to this contest. Therefore,  
    -   
    - IT IS ORDERED affirming the trial court decision and confirming the election of the Biden Electors under A.R.S. § 16-676(B).`

### Bowyer v. Ducey.
- On 2 December 2020, Sidney Powell, who litigated on behalf of some Arizona voters and one candidate for Republican Arizona presidential elector, filed a lawsuit in federal court against the governor, secretary of state, and other Arizona election officials. They asked the court to decertify Arizona's election results, or order that Arizona certify Trump electors. [link](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/18707812/bowyer-v-ducey/)
- On 9 December 2020, The judge ruled that the plaintiffs lacked legal standing.
    
    - `Plaintiffs bring their Complaint seeking injunctive relief from this Court, specifically, to “set aside the results of the 2020 General Election,” because they claim the election process and results were “so riddled with fraud, illegality and statistical impossibility . . . that Arizona voters, courts and legislators cannot rely on or certify” its results. (Doc. 1 at 2). By any measure, the relief Plaintiffs seek is extraordinary. If granted, millions of Arizonans who exercised their individual right to vote in the 2020 General Election would be utterly disenfranchised. Such a request should then be accompanied by clear and conclusive facts to support the alleged “egregious range of conduct in Maricopa County and other Arizona counties . . . at the direction of Arizona state election officials.” (Id.) Yet the Complaint’s allegations are sorely wanting of relevant or reliable evidence, and Plaintiffs’ invocation of this Court’s limited jurisdiction is severely strained. Therefore, for the reasons stated herein, the Complaint shall be dismissed.` [link](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.azd.1255923/gov.uscourts.azd.1255923.84.0_2.pdf)
    
### Stevenson v. Ducey,
- On 4 December 2020, A group of voters alleged that Arizona election officials did not enforce Arizona residency requirements, permitted “double voting,” and used the Center for Tech and Civic Life to create illegal disparities in ballot and drop-box voting in demographically different areas of Arizona. Plaintiffs sought an injunction to prevent the certification of the election results and asked the governor to certify legislatively selected Presidential Electors.
    
    - `The Plaintiffs, by and through their attorneys of record, file this voter election contest to vacate the certification of the November 3, 2020 Presidential election result in Arizona pursuant to Arizona Statutes § 16-672 et. seq. The election officials’ absentee ballot error rate is legally unacceptable in light of the razor-thin vote margin.` [link](https://www.clerkofcourt.maricopa.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/1914/637426926829400000)
    
- On 7 November 2020, Plaintiff voluntarily dismissed after filing suit.
    
    - `Petitioners, pursuant to Rule 41 (a)(1)(A)(i) of the Arizona Rules of Civil Procedure, hereby give notice of their voluntary dismissal of the above-captioned action, without prejudice, and with no costs assigned to either party.

### Burk v. Ducey,
- On 7 November 2020, A voter alleged widespread voter fraud, including: failing to count valid ballots and fraudulently switching Trump votes to Biden ones; counting unlawful absentee and mail-in ballots; committing fraud with Dominion machines; and violating observation rights. The voter asked the court to decertify Arizona’s presidential election results or exclude unlawful absentee and mail-in ballots from the count.
    
    - `Plaintiff brings forth this election complaint to bring forth election fraud as well as violations of Arizona election laws, Electors Clauses, and the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, of the U.S. Constitution. These violations occurred during the 2020 General Election throughout the State of Arizona, as set forth in the affidavits of eyewitnesses and the voter data cited, the statistical anomalies and mathematical impossibilities detailed in the affidavits of expert witnesses.  
    -   
    - Plaintiff alleges a widespread scheme and artifice to defraud the election for the purpose of illegally and fraudulently manipulating the vote count to manufacture an election of Joe Biden as President of the United States,and also of various down ballot democrat candidates in the 2020 election cycle. This fraud was executed by the systemic adaptation of old-fashioned "ballot-stuffing," which included the transport of fraudulent ballots taken to the county tabulation center as well as by using software to manipulate the vote count in Maricopa County and using fraudulent and altered ballots in outlying counties to create an appearance ofa similar proportional result in the outlying counties such as Pinal.  
    -   
    - The widespread election fraud has now been amplified and rendered virtually invisible by computer software reated and run by domestic and foreign actors for this very purpose. This Complaint details an especially egregious nge of conduct in Maricopa County and other Arizona counties using employing Dominion Systems, though this onduct occurred throughout the State at the direction of Arizona state election officials.`

- On 15 November 2020, The State judge dismissed case after argument for lack of standing as voter did not show they were registered, also finding the complaint was untimely and barred by laches.
    
    - `The Court has reviewed and considered the Motions to Dismiss filed by the Governor. the Secretary of State and the Maricopa County Attorneys Office and the Response filed by Plaintiff. In addition, the Court has also considered the oral arguments of counsel. the Notice of Filing, filed on December 14, 2020 by the Secretary of State and Plaintiffs Response to it.  
    -   
    - Good cause exists to grant the Motions to Dismiss on multiple separate and independent grounds raised by the moving parties, including the following:  
    -   
    - PLAINTIFF IS NOT AUTHORIZEQ. BRING It-its ELECTION CONTEST BECAUSE SHE WAS NOT REGISTERED TO VOTE IN THE 2020 GENERAL ELECTION WHEN SHE FILED HER COMPLAINT`

- On 3 March 2021, the case was filed with SCOTUS but was denied.
    
    - `This action is brought to secure equitable relief resulting from Defendants' unlawful deprivation of Plaintiffs rights, privileges, and immunities guaranteed by the Equal Protection and Due Process Clause of the U.S. Const. Amend. XIV, the U.S. Const. Amend. I, and the laws of Arizona and the United States. Petitioner contends the juxtaposition of unqualified voters having their vote counted in the 2020 election, while a real person (Petitioner) was illegally denied her voice is the heart of her constitutional and election challenge claims.` [link](https://crimeofthecentury2020.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Petition030321.pdf)

In re: Enforcement of Election Laws and Securing Ballots Cast or Received after 7:00pm on November 3, 2020. [link](https://healthyelections-case-tracker.stanford.edu/detail?id=345)
- On 4 November 2020, the Trump campaign and the Georgia Republican Party filed suit in the Chatham County Superior Court, alleging that the Chatham County Board of Elections had failed "to safely store absentee ballots" and might be illegally accepting "absentee ballots arriving after 7:00 p.m. on Election Day.”
- On 5 November 2020, The judge denied the request to toss out the 53 ballots that a GOP poll watcher said arrived after polls closed at 7 p.m. on November 3.
    
    - `Before the Court is a Petition to Command Enforcement of Election Laws which was filed by the Georgia Republican Party and Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. The matter was heard via Webex on November 5, 2020. Having read and considered said petition, all argument and evidence of record, including the evidence presented at the hearing, and the applicable law, the Court finds that there is no evidence that the ballots referenced in the petition were received after 7:00 p.m. on election day, thereby making those ballots invalid. Additionally, there is no evidence that the Chatham County Board of Elections or the Chatham County Board of Registrars has failed to comply with the law.  
    -   
    - WHEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the above petition is DISMISSED.`

- Republican elector Lin Wood, [whose attorney also represents the Trump campaign](https://lawandcrime.com/2020-election/trump-appointed-judge-rejects-lin-woods-creative-election-lawsuit-in-georgia/), sued to stop vote certification because. He argued that because the Georgia Secretary of State agreed to allow signature matching on ballots — a measure designed to prevent voter fraud — eight months before the election, his rights as an individual voter had been infringed upon. A state judge [dismissed the case](https://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/judge-dismisses-trump-campaign-lawsuit-seeking-to-halt-georgia-election-certification), [saying the arguments have "no basis in fact and law."](https://lawandcrime.com/2020-election/trump-appointed-judge-rejects-lin-woods-creative-election-lawsuit-in-georgia/)
  
  
- Wood filed another lawsuit in federal court and [lost that one as well](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/7334748/12-5-20-11th-Circuit-Opinion-Wood-v-Raffensperger.pdf), [losing again upon appeal](https://twitter.com/marceelias/status/1343603310293606401).

A federal judge [quickly dismissed the case](https://www.businessinsider.com/sidney-powell-loses-2-kraken-lawsuits-in-one-day-in-georgia-michigan-2020-12), calling it "extraordinary" that the lawsuit sought to disqualify the votes of millions of voters.

Trump withdrew the case on January 7, according to court records reviewed by Insider.
### Michigan
- In a federal lawsuit, the Trump campaign alleged a number of irregularities — [such as that GOP election observers were told to stand six feet away from ballot counters because of the coronavirus](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-michigan-election-lawsuit-poll-watchers-social-distancing-complaints-2020-11) — meant that Michigan should not certify its votes. The Trump campaign [withdrew the lawsuit](https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.miwd.99598/gov.uscourts.miwd.99598.33.0.pdf), with [Rudy Giuliani falsely declaring it achieved the result the campaign wanted](https://twitter.com/WardDPatrick/status/1329444160701685762).
- A judge on the Michigan Court of Claims denied the Trump campaign's request to stop counting ballots in the state. [Judge Cynthia Stephens said](https://www.michigan.gov/documents/ag/20201106_Opin_and_Ord_707156_7.pdf) litigating the issue didn't make sense given that ballots in Michigan had more or less been fully counted.
- A poll challenger named Sarah Stoddard and a group called the Election Integrity Fund [filed a lawsuit](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/detroit-city/2020/11/05/election-challenger-suit-halt-detroit-absentee-vote-count/6181615002/) seeking to stop the certification of election results in Detroit, claiming that absentee ballots were improperly reviewed. Judge Timothy Kenny [denied](https://www.michigan.gov/documents/ag/Stoddard_et_al_v_City_Election_Commission_et_al_-_11-06-2020_707182_7.pdf) the motion on the grounds that there was no proof that election oversight protocol hadn't been followed. Kenny issued another ruling later denying other motions, including [a request for an additional audit of the election](https://beta.documentcloud.org/documents/20407012-michigan-election-lawsuit-kenney-costantino-et-al-v-wayne-boc-et-al-opinion-order).

    - `Perhaps if Plaintiffs’ election challenger affiants had attended the October 29, 2020 walk-through of the TCF Center ballot counting location, questions and concerns could have been answered in advance of Election Day. Regrettably, they did not and, therefore, Plaintiffs’ affiants did not have a full understanding of the TCF absent ballot tabulation process. No formal challenges were filed.

A judge [ruled against her](https://www.businessinsider.com/sidney-powell-loses-2-kraken-lawsuits-in-one-day-in-georgia-michigan-2020-12) and issued a scathing 35-page opinion tearing it down on multiple fronts.

- The Trump campaign filed a lawsuit requesting that ballots stop being counted in the state over concerns about signature-matching technology and election observers' claims that they weren't being allowed to watch ballots being processed closely enough. The Nevada Supreme Court [denied the request](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/trump-files-emergency-nevada-appeal-over-clark-county-ballots).
- The Trump campaign and the RNC filed a lawsuit in state court asking to stop ballot counting in Clark County — a heavily Democratic area — until GOP officials could observe the process. A district judge rejected the request on the grounds that the plaintiffs did not have evidence to back up their allegations. Republicans appealed the case to the Nevada Supreme Court, which said on November 5 that the campaign and Republican officials had [reached a settlement that allowed expanded ballot observation](https://news3lv.com/news/local/trump-campaign-reaches-settlement-in-nevada-lawsuit-to-expand-ballot-observation).

- The Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee filed a lawsuit asking a state appeals court to reject the Pennsylvania secretary of state's announcement that registered voters had until November 12 to provide proof of identity for mail-in ballots. Republicans believe the deadline should be November 9. This is the one case [that Trump won](https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/11/12/trump-campaign-election-2020-presidential-pennsylvania-lawsuit-ballots-late-identification/stories/202011120132), before the state Supreme Court [overturned the lower court decision](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/17/philadelphia-donald-trump-us-elections-2020-joe-biden).

They've [argued that 14,000 votes should be thrown out](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-campaign-lawsuit-pennsylvania-votes-biden-enough-win-2020-11). The campaign submitted [a revised version of the lawsuit](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-campaign-drops-part-of-pa-lawsuit-regarding-election-observers-2020-11) days later that retracted many of its original allegations. A judge [threw out the case](https://www.businessinsider.com/federal-judge-brann-rejects-trump-campaign-lawsuit-pennsylvania-2020-11), saying Trump's lawyers presented the court "with [strained legal arguments](https://www.businessinsider.com/pennsylvania-defense-lawyers-shredded-rudy-giuliani-trump-election-lawsuit-2020-11) without merit and speculative accusations, unpaid in the operative complaint and unsupported by evidence." An appeal of the case [also failed](https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Trump.pdf).
    
    - `This claim, like Franken­stein’s Monster, has been haphaz­ardly stitched together` ... `This Court has been presen­ted with strained legal argu­ments without merit and spec­u­lat­ive accus­a­tions, unpled in the oper­at­ive complaint and unsupported by evid­ence. In the United States of Amer­ica, this cannot justify the disen­fran­chise­ment of a single voter, let alone all the voters of its sixth most popu­lated state. Our people, laws, and insti­tu­tions demand more` [link](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.pamd.127057/gov.uscourts.pamd.127057.202.0_1.pdf)
    
- [Another federal lawsuit](https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/2020/10/show_temp.pl-4.pdf) brought by Republicans sought to delay the deadline for ballot requests. The judge [rejected it](https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/2020/10/Third-Circuit-Opinion.pdf).
- A third federal lawsuit [sought to stop](https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/2020/11/Eastern-District-Complaint.pdf) the Montgomery County Board of Elections from allowing voters to "cure" their ballots — a process that allows people to fix clerical errors on their ballots to make sure their votes count. Republicans [abandoned the lawsuit and withdrew from the case](https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/2020/11/ORDER-1.pdf).
- The campaign sued in yet another federal case [to stop Philadelphia County from counting votes](https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/2020/11/FullText.pdf) without Republicans present. The judge [dismissed the case](https://whyy.org/articles/trump-asks-federal-court-to-stop-vote-counting-in-phiadelphia/) after Trump's lawyers said Republican election watchers were, in fact, present.
- In another Montgomery County case, [this one filed in a local court](https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/2020/11/Donald-J.-Trump-for-President-Inc.-v.-Montgomery-County-Board-of-Elections.pdf), Trump's lawyers sought to stop the county from counting mail-in ballots. [The lawyers withdrew from the case](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/13/trump-law-firm-withdraws-pennsylvania-election-case).
- A lawsuit in Bucks County filed by Republican congressional candidate Kathy Barnette on Election Day made a technical challenge on the county's method of organizing ballots before counting them. She [withdrew the case](https://www.buckscountycouriertimes.com/story/news/2020/11/05/barnette-withdraws-mail-ballot-lawsuit-montgomery-county-election/6176910002/) two days later and lost the election.
- The Trump campaign [appealed that Bucks County case](https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/2020/11/TS-Petition-for-Review-of-Decision-by-Bucks-County-Board-of-Elections-11.9.2020-1.pdf) soon afterward, but a judge [rejected it](http://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2020/images/11/19/scan.document_11192020_041015.pdf) and [pointed out in his ruling](https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/19/politics/arizona-pennsylvania-georgia-lawsuits-trump-biden/index.html) that fraud wasn't an issue.
- In a state court, Republicans [challenged an instruction from the Secretary of State's office regarding provisional ballots](https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/2020/11/Preview_08501C84-5760-47CE-A63C-47106B07AB6D-1.pdf). A state appellate court judge [dismissed](https://twitter.com/johnkruzel/status/1324811512003891202) the request but [ordered](https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/2020/11/FILE-8407.pdf) the secretary of state to [segregate](https://www.businessinsider.com/why-pennsylvania-texas-minnesota-segregating-ballots-in-case-thrown-out-2020-11) provisional ballots in case their validity becomes contested.
- Local Republicans sought to stop Northampton County from revealing the identities of people whose ballots were canceled and [lost the case](https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/2020/11/ORDER-11-3-20.pdf).
- A group of Pennsylvania Republicans [lost](https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/28/politics/pennsylvania-state-supreme-court-election-case/index.html) at the state Supreme Court with a lawsuit trying to invalidate absentee voting after the voting period already ended, and trying to block the certification of election results.
- Another group of Republicans filed [a similar lawsuit](https://www.democracydocket.com/cases/pennsylvania-decertification-challenge/) and lost.
- The Trump campaign filed a [motion to intervene in a Supreme Court case](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-trump-may-challenge-2020-election-supreme-court-2020-11) brought by Republicans that centers on the deadline by which Pennsylvania officials are allowed to receive ballots. Pennsylvania's Supreme Court ruled that officials could receive ballots until November 6 as long as they are postmarked by Election Day. Republicans appealed the decision to the high court, which was deadlocked at 4-4 because Justice Amy Coney Barrett did not participate, leaving the lower court's ruling in place. The Supreme Court signaled it could hear the case again but has not granted the request to intervene.
### Wisconsin
- The Wisconsin Supreme Court [rejected a case](https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-donald-trump-wisconsin-lawsuits-2917742813e06908608848410ff41b0c) from the Trump campaign seeking to overturn election results.
- Trump personally filed a similar lawsuit in a federal court in Wisconsin. A Trump-appointed federal judge said he had standing to bring the case — a rare departure from other judges — [and then ruled against him](https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2020/12/12/trump-wisconsin-lawsuit-dismissed-federal-judge/3894689001/). [An appeal failed as well](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/24/trump-loses-wisconsin-georgia-450433), with the author of the appellate opinion also a Trump appointee.
- Wisconsin Voters Alliance, a right-wing group, [sued the state elections commission](https://www.wpr.org/lawsuit-asks-wisconsin-supreme-court-throw-out-results-presidential-election) and asked the state Supreme Court to throw out votes and have the Republican-controlled state legislature select the electoral college winner themselves. [The state Supreme Court rejected it, saying it had little basis in fact](https://www.channel3000.com/state-supreme-court-rejects-lawsuit-from-conservative-group-attempting-to-prevent-certification-of-election-results/).
    
    - `At stake, in some meas­ure, is faith in our system of free and fair elec­tions, a feature cent­ral to the endur­ing strength of our consti­tu­tional repub­lic. It can be easy to blithely move on to the next case with a peti­tion so obvi­ously lack­ing, but this is sober­ing. The relief being sought by the peti­tion­ers is the most dramatic invoc­a­tion of judi­cial power I have ever seen. Judi­cial acqui­es­cence to such entreat­ies built on so flimsy a found­a­tion would do indelible damage to every future elec­tion.` [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20210522064207/https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/2020/11/2020AP1930-OAfinal-12-4-20.pdf)
    
- Wisconsin Voter Alliance also sued a number of defendants in Washington, DC, including Vice President Mike Pence, both houses of Congress, and the Electoral College, trying to block the certification of Wisconsin's votes as well as those of other states. [A federal judge threw out the case](https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.225330/gov.uscourts.dcd.225330.10.0_1.pdf), blasted it as an attempted "undermining of a democratic election" full of falsehoods, and said he would refer the attorneys for sanctions.
- [Another lawsuit](https://www.wpr.org/new-lawsuit-asks-state-supreme-court-toss-nov-3-election-results) backed by the Republican-aligned Amos Center for Justice and Liberty argued that the use of ballot drop-boxes was illegal. It also asked that the state Supreme Court should throw out every vote cast and have the GOP legislature select the state's electoral votes. A judge [ruled it moot](https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/2020/11/2020AP1958-OA-12-3-20.pdf).
- A lawsuit from Sidney Powell and Lin Wood, another Trump ally, makes numerous conspiratorial claims about the election. A federal judge [criticized it for containing errors and typos, and one person listed as plaintiff said they never signed up to be a part of the lawsuit](https://lawandcrime.com/2020-election/wisconsin-federal-judge-picks-apart-sidney-powell-and-lin-woods-lawsuit-in-brutal-order/), later [dismissing the case](https://www.businessinsider.com/sidney-powell-lawsuits-dismissed-michigan-georgia-arizona-wisconsin-2020-12).
- Trump and Pence personally sued Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris in a state court [seeking to overturn votes](https://lawandcrime.com/2020-election/outgoing-trump-white-house-sues-incoming-biden-white-house-to-disenfranchise-wisconsins-most-diverse-counties/) in two Wisconsin counties with large Black populations, both of which sided with Democrats. A judge [threw out the case](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-loses-wisconsin-election-lawsuit-challenging-mail-votes-2020-12). When Trump appealed the case, another judge rejected it and [said it "smacks of racism."](https://www.businessinsider.com/wisconsin-trump-election-fraud-lawsuit-smacks-of-racism-judge-says-2020-12) [An appeal to the Supreme Court also failed](https://www.wicourts.gov/sc/opinion/DisplayDocument.pdf?content=pdf&seqNo=315395).

### January 6 Capitol Hill Insurrection
- On 6 January 2021 @ 1:00AM EST, President Trump tweeted,
    
    - `If Vice President @Mike_Pence comes through for us, we will win the Presidency. Many States want to decertify the mistake they made in certifying incorrect & even fraudulent numbers in a process NOT approved by their State Legislatures (which it must be). Mike can send it back!` [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20210106060056/https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1346698217304584192)
    
- On 6 January 2021 @ 8:17AM EST, President Trump tweeted,
    
    - `States want to correct their votes, which they now know were based on irregularities and fraud, plus corrupt process never received legislative approval. All Mike Pence has to do is send them back to the States, AND WE WIN. Do it Mike, this is a time for extreme courage!` [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20210106131747/https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1346808075626426371)
    
- On 6 January 2021 @ 11:58AM-13:10PM EST, Trump started his `Save America` Rally Speech, for more than an hour, repeating false claims about a stolen election and telling the crowd to “never give up” and “never concede.”
    
    - `So we’re going to, we’re going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue. I love Pennsylvania Avenue. And we’re going to the Capitol, and we’re going to try and give.  
    -   
    - The Democrats are hopeless, they never vote for anything. Not even one vote. But we’re going to try and give our Republicans, the weak ones because the strong ones don’t need any of our help. We’re going to try and give them the kind of pride and boldness that they need to take back our country.  
    -   
    - So let’s walk down Pennsylvania Avenue.`

- On 6 January 2021 @ 13:00PM EST, An initial wave of protesters storms the outer barricade west of the Capitol building as senators and Vice President Pence walk to the House chamber.

- On 6 January 2021 @ 13:05PM EST, Vice President Pence released a letter about the Electoral College certification,
    
    - `Given the controversy surrounding this year's election, some approach this year's quadrennial tradition with great expectation, and others with dismissive disdain. Some believe that as Vice President, I should be able to accept or reject electoral votes unilaterally. Others believe that electoral votes should never be challenged in a Joint Session of Congress. After a careful study of our Constitution, our laws, and our history, I believe neither view is correct.  
    -   
    - ...  
    -   
    - Four years ago, surrounded by my family, I took an oath to support and defend the Constitution, which ended with the words, “ So help me God. ” Today I want to assure the American people that I will keep the oath I made to them and I will keep the oath I made to Almighty God. When the Joint Session of Congress convenes today, I will do my duty to see to it that we open the certificates of the Electors of the several states, we hear objections raised by Senators and Representatives, and we count the votes of the Electoral College for President and Vice President in a manner consistent with our Constitution, laws, and history. So Help Me God.`

- On 6 January 2021 @ 16:17PM EST, President Trump tweeted a video and then got deleted,
    
    - `I know your pain. I know you're hurt. We had an election that was stolen from us. It was a landslide election and everyone knows it, especially the other side. But you have to go home now. We have to have peace. We have to have law and order. We have to respect our great people in law and order. We don't want anybody hurt. It's a very tough period of time. There's never been a time like this where such a thing happened where they could take it away from all of us, from me, from you, from our country. This was a fraudulent election. But we can't play into the hands of these people. We have to have peace. So go home, we love you. You're very special. You've seen what happens. You see the way others are treated that are so bad and so evil.

Trump’s account had been locked by the company for posting messages that appeared to justify the assault on the seat of the nation’s democracy. Trump added, “While this represents the end of the greatest first term in presidential history, it’s only the beginning of our fight to Make America Great Again!”` [link](https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-orderly-transition-f03215c31a400f815a8f62960a430063)

- Election integrity experts argued that the commission was disbanded because of the lawsuits, which would have led to greater transparency and accountability in the commission and thus prevented the Republican members of the commission from producing a sham report to justify restrictions on voting rights, [link](http://www.pressherald.com/2018/01/06/trump-administration-resists-turning-over-documents-to-dunlap/)

### Academic Research on Voter Fraud With Vote-by-Mail
- A 2020 Paper found that,
    
    - `In our data, we confirm important conventional wisdom among election experts: VBM offers voters considerable convenience, increases turnout rates modestly, but has no discernible effect on party vote shares or the partisan share of the electorate.` [link](https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.2007249117)
    
- A 2020 Paper found that,
    
    - `Mandatory VBM increases turnout modestly in general elections but does not substantively advantage either political party. These results are vitally important given contemporary debates at local, state, and federal levels over the merits of this mode of administering elections.` [link](https://www.sci-hub.ee/10.1126/sciadv.abc7685)
