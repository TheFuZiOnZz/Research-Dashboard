### FBIs Attempt To Spy on Clinton Campaign
- The FBI encouraged a Confidential Human Source to infiltrate the Clinton campaign to attempt to entrap Hilary Clinton
    
    - `According to CHS-A, Insider-I, on behalf of Foreign Govemment-3, sought access through CHS-A, to a Clinton campaign fundraising event in the Fall of 2015. Although CHSA was initially advised by an individual associated with the fundraising efforts that Insider-1 could attend, that individual consulted with the campaign and disinvited Insider-1 to the event because of the perceived negative attention a foreign national might attract. According to CHS-A, the fundraising contact suggested CHS-A schedule a separate meeting for Insider-1. Field Office-I renewed the OIA from late 2014 for the CHS to attend the late November 2015 event and make introductions on behalf of Insider-I, but ultimately CHS-A did not attend the event.` - Durham Report [link](https://www.justice.gov/storage/durhamreport.pdf)
