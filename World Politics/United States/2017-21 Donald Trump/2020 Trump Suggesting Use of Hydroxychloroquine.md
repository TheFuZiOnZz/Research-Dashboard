### 2020 Trump Suggesting Use of Hydroxychloroquine
- On March 19, Trump falsely claimed that the drug chloroquine was approved by the Food and Drug Administration as a treatment for COVID-19. This led the FDA to state that it had not approved any drugs or therapies for COVID-19. While Trump claimed that `we're going to be able to make that drug available almost immediately`, the leader of the FDA stated that the drug would still need to be tested in a `large, pragmatic clinical trial` on subjects infected with COVID-19.

- Trump promoted the drugs chloroquine (also known as chloroquine phosphate)[400] and hydroxychloroquine as potential treatments `by prescription` for COVID-19 on March 19. He noted the drugs showed `tremendous promise` and said he was working together with Governor Cuomo to begin quickly studying and treating coronavirus patients with the drugs in New York. He also remarked on their long-term usage as medicines in the United States saying, `the nice part is, it's been around for a long time, so we know that if it—if things don't go as planned, it's not going to kill anybody.` [link](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/trump-is-overhyping-unproven-coronavirus-drugs/2020/03/19/ed1ff4e2-6a1a-11ea-b199-3a9799c54512_story.html) [link](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-6/)
