### 2017 Trump Pulls the U.S. out of the Paris Climate Accord
- The quotes that follow are taken from Trump’s June 1, 2017, statement withdrawing the United States from the Paris climate agreement, which united 195 countries in a pact to reduce greenhouse gas emissions globally. [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3wE7MO1uSw)
- 1. `The Paris climate accord is simply the latest example of Washington entering into an agreement that disadvantages the United States to the exclusive benefit of other countries, leaving American workers—who I love—and taxpayers to absorb the cost in terms of lost jobs, lower wages, shuttered factories, and vastly diminished economic production.`
- Under international law, the United States can leave the agreement only according to the terms laid out in the agreement. [link](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=99b794c4-5c1a-44f4-ae44-50528e152cfe) The Paris Agreement prevents countries from withdrawing until `three years from the date on which [it] has entered into force.` The agreement took effect on November 4, 2016, so the United States legally cannot give notice until November 4, 2019―and notification won’t take effect until November 4, 2020, after the next presidential election.
- Furthermore, three leading members of the European Union say the agreement is not open to renegotiation. These nations―France, Germany, and Italy―also reaffirmed their `commitment to swiftly implement` the deal in a rare joint statement following Trump’s remarks.

- 2. `Thus, as of today, the United States will cease all implementation of the nonbinding Paris accord and the draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country.`
- A nonbinding agreement, by definition, cannot impose burdens of any kind on a signatory. All national commitments in the Paris accord are voluntary and determined by the individual countries themselves. [link](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nonbinding)
- 3. `China will be able to increase these emissions by a staggering number of years—13. They can do whatever they want for 13 years. Not us.`
- China committed to reduce its carbon intensity (carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP) by 60 to 65 percent of 2005 levels. [link](https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/paris-climate-conference-China-IB.pdf) This commitment recognizes that China’s economy is still developing and means that China’s carbon dioxide emissions cannot grow faster than the Chinese economy. China’s carbon dioxide emissions must top out by 2030.
- China already has the most solar and wind power capacity in the world, having installed nearly two times as many solar panels and three times as much wind power in 2016 as the United States.

It committed $88.2 billion in 2016 to renewables, compared with the U.S. investment of $58.8 billion, and in January 2017, [link](https://about.bnef.com/blog/record-30bn-year-offshore-wind-overall-investment/) it announced plans to invest $360 billion through 2020 and create 13 million clean energy jobs.

- Biden is in support of `Re-enter the Paris Agreement on day one of the Biden Administration and lead a major diplomatic push to raise the ambitions of countries’ climate targets. The Paris Agreement was a historic breakthrough for the world, and reflected the power of patient, strategic diplomacy in service of America’s long-term national interests. The core of the agreement relies on countries continually increasing the ambition of their climate targets over time.` [link](https://joebiden.com/climate/)
