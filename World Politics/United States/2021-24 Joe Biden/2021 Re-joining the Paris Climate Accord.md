- The aim of the agreement is to decrease global warming described in its Article 2, "enhancing the implementation" of the UNFCCC through: [link](http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2015/cop21/eng/l09r01.pdf)
    - (a) Holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change;
    - (b) Increasing the ability to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change and foster climate resilience and low greenhouse gas emissions development, in a manner that does not threaten food production;
    - (c) Making finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development.

- A pair of studies in Nature have said that, as of 2017, none of the major industrialized nations were implementing the policies they had envisioned and they have not met their pledged emission reduction targets, and even if they had, the sum of all member pledges (as of 2016) would not keep global temperature rise "well below 2 °C".

- A 2018 published study points at a threshold at which temperatures could rise to 4 or 5 degrees (ambiguous phrase, continuity would be “4-5 °C”) compared to the pre-industrial levels, through self-reinforcing feedbacks in the climate system, suggesting this threshold is below the 2-degree temperature target, agreed upon by the Paris climate deal. Study author Katherine Richardson stresses:
    - "We note that the Earth has never in its history had a quasi-stable state that is around 2 °C warmer than the pre-industrial and suggest that there is substantial risk that the system, itself, will 'want' to continue warming because of all of these other processes – even if we stop emissions. This implies not only reducing emissions but much more." [link](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/33/8252)
