The $23m arrived in London from Latvia, a minimally regulated Eastern European country, where banks are famously welcoming towards money from the former Soviet Union.`
      
      `On 14 April 2014, the money was frozen at a special court hearing in London requested by the Serious Fraud Office. As described in the later court judgment, the SFO argued that “there were reasonable grounds to believe that the defendant [Zlochevsky] had engaged in criminal conduct in Ukraine and the funds in the BNP account were believed to be the proceeds of such criminal conduct”.` - [The money machine: how a high-profile corruption investigation fell apart, The Guardian, 2017](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/12/the-money-machine-how-a-high-profile-corruption-investigation-fell-apart)

    - `We have learned that there have been times that the Prosecutor General Office not only did not support investigations into corruption, but rather undermined prosecutors working on legitimate corruption cases.`

Officials at the Prosecutor General Office’s office were asked by the U.K to send documents supporting the seizure.`

A key goal for the trip was to urge the government to crack down on corruption, starting with the removal of the powerful prosecutor general, viewed by U.S. and European officials as an impediment to reform.`
      
      `Under a tactical policy known inside the Obama administration as “big hugs and little punches,” U.S. officials originally planned to have Biden urge Poroshenko to fire the prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, but at the same time sign a renewal of a $1 billion loan guarantee. On the plane, according to a person who participated in the conversation, Biden “called an audible” — he changed the plan. It was time for a bigger punch: The loan guarantee was the main point of leverage with Ukraine, the vice president declared, so he instead should tell Poroshenko the loan would not be forthcoming until Shokin was gone` - [Inside VP Biden’s linking of a loan to a Ukraine prosecutor’s ouster, The Washington Post, 2023](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/09/15/inside-vp-bidens-linking-loan-ukraine-prosecutors-ouster/)

- On 16 February 2016, Shokin supposedly submitted a letter of resignation.
    - `Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin resigned on Feb. 16, a Kyiv Post source in his office said.`
      
      `“Yes, he resigned,” the source said.`

- On 15 March 2016, in testimony to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Victoria Nuland, Assistant Secretary to the Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs in the U.S. Department of State, stated the U.S. used $1 billion in loan guarantees to bargain for reform with the Prosecutor Generals office in conjunction with the IMF, World Bank and EU.
    - `How does the United States be more effective in rooting out that type of corruption and supporting leaders in that country that take the brave stands and the right stand that the people of Ukraine want? How specifically can 2016—you say it could be a great year. What can the United States do to make 2016 that type of a year? Ms. NULAND. Well, the first thing that we do is what we have done throughout this, which is to peg our assistance to those things that the IMF and the EU need to see for reform. So in particular, we have pegged our next $1 billion loan guarantee, first and foremost, to having a rebooting of the reform coalition so that we know who we are working with, but secondarily, to ensuring that the prosecutor general’s office gets cleaned up, as I said. The current prosecutor general, as you mentioned, has resigned. We need to see a clean model citizen who is really going to take justice forward in Ukraine appointed there and confirmed. We need to see the next stage in de-oligarching the economy, if that is a word, and by that, it is some of the things that I mentioned, including privatization of these state-owned enterprises that are used to siphon off money.` - [Ukranian Reforms Two Years After the Maidan Revolution And the Russian Invasion, Senate Committee On Foreign Relations, 2016](https://www.foreign.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/03%2015%2016%20Ukrainian%20Reforms%20Two%20Years%20After%20the%20Maidan%20Revolution%20and%20the%20Russian%20Invasion.pdf)
- On 15 March 2016, in testimony to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, former ambassador to Ukraine John Herbst stated that the U.S. was wanting Shokin’s removal in November 2015.
    - `By late fall of 2015, the EU and the United States joined the chorus of those seeking Mr. Shokin’s removal as the start of an overall reform of the Procurator General’s Office. U.S. Vice President Joe Biden spoke publicly about this before and during his December visit to Kyiv; but Mr. Shokin remained in place.` - [Ukranian Reforms Two Years After the Maidan Revolution And the Russian Invasion, Senate Committee On Foreign Relations, 2016](https://www.foreign.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/03%2015%2016%20Ukrainian%20Reforms%20Two%20Years%20After%20the%20Maidan%20Revolution%20and%20the%20Russian%20Invasion.pdf)
- On 15 March 2016, in testimony to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Ian J. Brzezinski, Senior Fellow at Brent Scowcroft Center on International Security at the Atlantic Council made comments on the desire of firing Shokin.
    - `While reform was substantial in 2015, it was not enough for many Ukrainians. Critics focused on the absence of any change in the prosecutor general’s office and the judiciary and claimed that the president and the prime minister were not interested in going after these major sources of corruption.  
          
        Early this year, three reform ministers resigned quietly. Then Economic Minister Abramavicius resigned complaining that he could not do his job because of corruption, and that corruption went all the way to the top. Reformers in civil society spoke up for Mr. Abramavicius, so did the U.S., the EU, and the IMF. In response, President Poroshenko called for the removal of Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin, and the Rada passed reform legislation that had been blocked for months.`

- On 16 March 2016, Shokin reportedly returns to work by raiding the Anti-Corruption Action Center, a NGO which exposed corruption in Ukraine, including Shokin himself.
    - `Kyiv’s Pechersky District Court has issued a warrant allowing investigators from the Prosecutor General’s Office to remove documents and other items from the Anti-Corruption Action Centre [AntAC]. They have also been permitted to demand access to confidential information from the NGO’s bank. All of this is, purportedly, how the Prosecutor General’s Office, still under Viktor Shokin, is planning to investigate the disappearance of money donated by US and European partners for reforming the prosecutor’s service.` - [Prosecutor General’s Office obtains carte blanche to raid anti-corruption NGO, Kharkiv Human Rights Protection Group, 2016](https://khpg.org/en/1459020068) 
    - `The money used in drawing up tests guaranteed to prevent corrupt arrangements were effectively sabotaged by Shokin himself who appointed the old guard in the majority of cases. This is just one of numerous grounds for concern.`
      
      `After it seemed that Shokin had stepped down, civic activists, lawyers and relatives of Nebesna Sotnya, those killed during Euromaidan, even issued a public statement calling for a proper competition so that the fourth Prosecutor General since Euromaidan actually kept the promises they all make, including on fighting corruption.`
      
      `As the end of March approaches, it is not even entirely clear that Shokin is planning to vacate his post, and the struggle at present seems more akin to an offensive against an NGO fighting corruption.` - [Prosecutor General’s Office obtains carte blanche to raid anti-corruption NGO, Kharkiv Human Rights Protection Group, 2016](https://khpg.org/en/1459020068)
- On 29 March 2016, Shokin was formally dismissed in a vote by the Verkhovna Rada.

- On 11 October 2019, as part of the 1st Trump impeachment inquiry’s, in testimony to the House Intelligence Committee, former ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch testified that the U.S. wanting Shokin’s removal was different in decision making when wanting further reform around Lutsenko’s tenure.
    - `Q There was never as much of a clamor to remove Lutsenko as there was Shokin. Is that fair to say?`
      
      `A Yeah, I think that's fair.`
      
      `Q And what do you account for that?`
      
      `A I would say that there was, I think, still a hope that one could work with Mr. Lutsenko. There was also the prospect of Presidential elections coming up, and as seemed likely by, you know, December, January, February, whatever the time was, that there would be a change of government. And I think we certainly hoped that Mr. Lutsenko would be replaced in the natural order of things, which is, in fact, what happened. We also had more leverage before. I mean, th1s was not easy. President Poroshenko and Mr. Shokin go way back. In fact, I think they are godfathers to each other's children. So this was, you know, this was a big dea1. But we had assistance, as did the IMF, that we could condition.` - [Deposition of Marie Yovanovitch, House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, 2019](https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IG/IG00/CPRT-116-IG00-D003.pdf)

    - `Q Going back to Shokin's tenure as prosecutor general.`
      
      `A Yes.`
      
      `Q You indicated that he was not well regarded for his legitimate prosecutions?`
      
      `A Correct.`
      
      `Q And the same can be said of Lutsenko?`
      
      `A Correct.`
      
      `Q With regard to Shokin, it really seemed that the IMF and the U.S. Government adopted an official position that Shokin had to go?`
      
      `A Correct.`
      
      `Q And that's the subject obviously of the Vice President. You know, he made some statements that have been videotaped about how he played a role in removing Shokin, and as a result, you know, $1 billion in aid was freed up. Are you familiar with that?`
      
      `A Yes.`
      
      `Q And is it fair to say that it was the U.S. Government's official position Shokin needed to go?`
      
      `A Yes.` - [Deposition of George Kent, House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, 2019](https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IG/IG00/CPRT-116-IG00-D009.pdf)

- On 2 December 2015, Blue Star Strategies sends a letter to Burisma disclosing an itinerary of VP Biden’s trip to Ukraine. The letter doesn’t mention Burisma in the planned messaging.
    - `According to the senior administration officials on the call, Vice President Biden will discuss the following issues and themes during his trip to Ukraine, namely that the U.S.:`
      
      `maintains its strong and sustained commitment to Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression;`
      
      `continues to categorically oppose Russia's annexation of Crimea;`

- On 24 February 2016, the State Department receives request for a meeting with Blue Star Strategies’ Chief Executive, Karen Tramontano to discuss the corruption allegations on Burisma.
    - `Per our conversation, Karen Tramontano of Blue Star Strategies requested a meeting to discuss with IJ/S Novelli USG remarks alleging Burisma (Ukranian energy company) of corruption. She noted that two high profile U.S. citizens are affiliated with the company (including Hunter Biden as a board member). Tramontano would like to talk with U/S Novelli about getting a better understanding of how the U.S. came to the determination that the company is corrupt. According to Tramontano, there is no evidence of corruption, has been no hearing or process, and evidence to the contrary has not been considered. Would appreciate any background you may be able to provide on this issue and suggested TPs for U/S Novelli's meeting.` - [Email from the State Department to CEO of Blue Star Strategies, U.S. Department of State, 2016](https://www.scribd.com/document/433389210/Bluestar-Novelli-Contacts)
- On 3 June 2021, Politico reported Blue Star Strategies was under investigation by the DoJ for possible failed to comply with disclosure requirements under the Foreign Agents Registration Act.
    - `The Justice Department is investigating the work of a consulting firm linked to the president’s son for potential illegal lobbying, four people familiar with the probe told POLITICO.`
      
      `The firm, Blue Star Strategies, took on as a client the Ukrainian energy company Burisma while Hunter Biden served on its board. Republican operatives’ efforts to investigate Burisma and the alleged corruption that surrounded the firm were at the heart of the first Trump impeachment.`
      
      `The probe comes as the Justice Department ramps up its scrutiny of foreign governments’ efforts to influence U.S. politics through covert lobbying operations. Much of that enforcement work has focused on Republicans linked to former President Donald Trump, including an active probe of his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani. The existence of the investigation into Blue Star, meanwhile, shows that DOJ’s torqued-up enforcement efforts may also create legal jeopardy for firms and operatives aligned with the Democratic Party.` - [Sources: Dem lobbying firm under federal investigation for Burisma work, POLITICO, 2021](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/06/03/blue-star-burisma-justice-department-investigation-491681)

    - `A Justice Department probe into a Washington lobbying firm’s work for Burisma Holdings has been closed with no finding of wrongdoing, according to an attorney for the CEO of the firm, Blue Star Strategies.`
      
      `The firm’s work for Burisma became a flashpoint in the debate over Hunter Biden’s role on the board of the Ukrainian oil and natural gas company, which has faced allegations of corruption domestically as well as in Britain and the United States.`
      
      `The conclusion of the probe, which has not been previously reported, involved the firm submitting a new filing with the Justice Department detailing its lobbying activities on behalf of Burisma and its owner, Mykola Zlochevsky, in 2015 and 2016. A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment.` - [Lobbying shop says DOJ probe into its work for Burisma has been closed, The Washington Post, 2022](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/17/burisma-blue-star-strategies-doj-probe/)
- On 23 May 2022, Ranking Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Ron Johnson & Charles Grassley send a letter to AG Garland saying that Tramontano’s FARA filings were illegitimate.
    - `In 2020, we examined the extent to which Blue Star Strategies, a Democratic lobbying firm, met with Obama administration officials on behalf of its foreign client, Burisma Holdings (“Burisma”), and the company’s corrupt Russia-aligned owner, Mykola Zlochevsky. Based on our investigative records and recently published Foreign Agents Registration Act (“FARA”) forms, it appears that Blue Star Strategies’ top executives, Karen Tramontano and Sally Painter, filed incomplete and misleading information with the Department of Justice (“DOJ”).`
      
      `According to FARA filings dated May 12, 2022, Ms. Tramontano and Ms. Painter disclosed under penalty of perjury their meetings with government officials on behalf of Burisma and Mr. Zlochevsky. The form noted that in February 2016, Blue Star Strategies emailed and met with then-State Department official Amos Hochstein to “introduce Mr. Zlochevsky’s attorney so he could present an explanation of the adverse proceedings in the U.K. and Ukraine involving Mr. Zlochevsky.”` - [Letter from Ron Johnson & Charles Grassley to Attorney General Merrick Gartland (23/05/22), U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, 2022](https://www.grassley.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/johnson_grassley_to_doj_-_blue_star_strategies.pdf)

    - `I remember going, convincing our team that we should be providing loan guarantees. To try to guess the 13th time, I was supposed to announce in Kiev that there was another billion-dollar loan guarantee.

    - `We assess that Russia is using a range of measures to primarily denigrate former Vice President Biden and what it sees as an anti-Russia “establishment.” This is consistent with Moscow’s public criticism of him when he was Vice President for his role in the Obama Administration’s policies on Ukraine and its support for the anti-Putin opposition inside Russia. For example, pro-Russia Ukrainian parliamentarian Andriy Derkach is spreading claims about corruption – including through publicizing leaked phone calls – to undermine former Vice President Biden’s candidacy and the Democratic Party.

- On 18 July 2023, Lev Parnas sent a letter to Chairman Comer detailing his extensive contribution to the Giuliani conspiracy creation story and stating he is willing to testify under oath to Congress.
    - `Throughout all these months of work, the extensive campaigns and networking done by Trump allies and Giuliani associates, including the enormously thorough interviews and assignments that I undertook, there has never been any evidence that Hunter or Joe Biden committed any crimes related to Ukrainian politics. Never, during any of my communications with Ukrainian officials or connections to Burisma, did any of them confirm or provide concrete facts linking the Bidens to illegal activities. In fact, they asked me multiple times why our team was so concerned with this idea. The truth is that everyone, from Giuliani and the BLT Team to Devin Nunes and his colleagues, to the people at FOX News, knew that these allegations against the Bidens were false. There has never been any factual evidence, only conspiracy theories spread by people who knew exactly what they were doing.`
      
      `With all due respect, Chairman Comer, the narrative you are seeking for this investigation has been proven false many times over, by a wide array of respected sources. There is simply no merit to investigating this matter any further. I hope my letter has provided you with additional clarity on this point.`
      
      `Please know that in my sharing this information with you, I am not looking for any sympathy for myself. I take full responsibility for my own actions in this matter, and I am extremely remorseful for my participation. In explaining the full context to you here, I can only hope that my truth can be used for the greater good. Please abandon this effort to investigate the Bidens, which is nothing more than a wild goose chase, and let our elected officials return to the issue at hand of uniting our great country to be stronger and better than ever before.`

    - `My firm, Blue Star Strategies, received a letter from you on December 3, 2019, asking us to assist in the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee's investigation into "certain officials within the Obama Administration." We responded immediately and agreed to cooperate. Two weeks later, on December 17, 2019, we submitted answers in writing to the Committee's questions and we provided documents about our meetings with the U.S. Government regarding Burisma.`
      
      `Subsequently, we were asked on March 19, 2020 to provide additional information. Because of the pandemic and the "stay at home" order in Washington, DC our supplemental response was delayed.`
      
      `On May 17, 2020, we provided answers and additional supporting documents to all the Committee's questions outlined in your December 3, 2019, letter. In response to our submission, the Committee expanded its request and asked for more documents from my firm. Yesterday, we provided the information requested and offered, if helpful, to be interviewed by the Committee.`
      
      `At every opportunity we have indicated to the Committee that it is our intention to cooperate. At no time have we ever stated or indicated in any way that we would not cooperate. Therefore, we are puzzled, despite our willingness to cooperate, why the Committee is proceeding to vote on a subpoena.`

# Intelligence Community Report
- On 15 March 2021, The Office of the Director of National Intelligence declassified and released a report on `Foreign Threats to the 2020 US Federal Elections`
    - `We assess that Russia's intelligence services, Ukraine-linked individuals with ties to Russian intelligence and their networks, and Russian state media, trolls, and online proxies engaged in activities targeting the 2020 US presidential election. The primary effort the IC uncovered revolved around a narrative-that Russian actors began spreading as early as 2014-alleging corrupt ties between President Biden, his family, and other US officials and Ukraine. Russian intelligence services relied on Ukraine-linked proxies and these proxies' networks-including their US contacts-to spread this narrative to give Moscow plausible deniability of their involvement. We assess that the goals of this effort went beyond the US presidential campaign to include reducing the Trump administration's support for Ukraine. As the US presidential election neared, Moscow placed increasing emphasis on undermining the candidate it saw as most detrimental to its global interests. We have no evidence suggesting the Ukrainian Government was involved in any of these efforts.`
      
      `A network of Ukraine-linked individuals-including Russian influence agent Konstantin Kilimnik-who were also connected to the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) took steps throughout the election cycle to damage US ties to Ukraine, denigrate President Biden and his candidacy, and benefit former President Trump's prospects for reelection. We assess this network also sought to discredit the Obama administration by emphasizing accusations of corruption by US officials, and to falsely blame Ukraine for interfering in the 2016 US presidential election.`
      
      `Derkach, Kilimnik, and their associates sought to use prominent US persons and media conduits to launder their narratives to US officials and audiences. These Russian proxies met with and provided materials to Trump administration-linked US persons to advocate for formal investigations; hired a US furn to petition US officials; and attempted to make contact with several senior US officials. They also made contact with established US media figures and helped produce a documentary that aired on a US television network in late January 2020.`
      
      `As part of his plan to secure the reelection of former President Trump, Derkach publicly released audio recordings four times in 2020 in attempts to implicate President Biden and other current or former US Government officials in allegedly corrupt activities related to Ukraine. Derkach also worked to initiate legal proceedings in Ukraine and the US related to these allegations. Former Ukrainian officials associated with Derkach sought to promote similar claims throughout late 2019 and 2020, including through direct outreach to senior US Government officials.` - [Foreign Threats to the 2020 US Federal Elections, U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence, 2021](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/20515484/icadeclass16mar21.pdf)

- [link](https://oversight.house.gov/the-bidens-influence-peddling-timeline/) - Majority’s purporting timeline
- The United States House Oversight Committee investigation into the Biden family is an investigation by the United States House of Representatives into whether US President Joe Biden is improperly involved in his family's foreign business practices, with allegations of "international influence peddling schemes", bribery, and a Justice Department cover-up. The investigation was initiated on 11 January 2023, by Republican committee chairman James Comer and includes examination of the foreign business activities of Biden's son, Hunter, and brother, James. The committee is also investigating Twitter's involvement in the Hunter Biden laptop controversy.
## FBI FD-1023 Form
- On 3 May 2023, Chairman Comer’s and Senator Grassley request the FD-1023 from the FBI.
    - `Senate Budget Committee Ranking Member and long-time whistleblower advocate Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and House Committee on Oversight and Accountability Chairman James Comer (R-Ky.) today are demanding the FBI produce an unclassified record alleging a criminal scheme involving then-Vice President Joe Biden and a foreign national. The document, an FBI-generated FD-1023 form, allegedly details an arrangement involving an exchange of money for policy decisions. Comer issued a subpoena today following legally protected disclosures to Grassley’s office.`
      
      `“We believe the FBI possesses an unclassified internal document that includes very serious and detailed allegations implicating the current President of the United States. What we don’t know is what, if anything, the FBI has done to verify these claims or investigate further. The FBI’s recent history of botching politically charged investigations demands close congressional oversight,” Grassley said.` - [link](https://oversight.house.gov/release/grassley-comer-demand-fbi-record-alleging-criminal-scheme-involving-then-vp-biden/)
- On 10 May 2023, Acting Assistant Director of the Office of Congressional Affairs, Christopher Dunham clarified what a FD-1023 actually is.
    - `Your letters and accompanying subpoena seek “an unclassified FD-1023 form” documenting certain allegations. By way of background, sensitive law enforcement materials, like FD-1023 Confidential Human Source Reporting forms (FD-1023) in which you have expressed interest, are critical to FBI’s faithful execution of federal law and protection of U.S. national security. An FD-1023 is one of many forms the FBI uses to collect and catalog information for its law enforcement and national security work. This form is used by FBI agents to record unverified reporting from a confidential human source. Reporting by confidential human sources is one important form of highly sensitive law enforcement information upon which the FBI relies to develop leads, assess the credibility of potential evidence and sources, build investigations, and take action to enforce the criminal law or protect national security. Confidential human sources are therefore critical to the work of FBI as well as other members of the U.S. intelligence and law enforcement communities. FBI’s work with confidential human sources and the handling of information they provide is governed by detailed policies and procedures, including multiple forms of existing oversight.` - [link](https://www.grassley.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/fbi_to_grassley_comer_-_biden_1023_response.pdf)
    - `Information from a confidential human source, including as reported in an FD-1023, certainly warrants such protections. Information from confidential human sources is unverified and, by definition, incomplete. An FD-1023 form documents information as told to a line FBI agent. Recording the information does not validate the information, establish its credibility, or weigh it against other information known or developed by the FBI. The mere existence of such a document would establish little beyond the fact that a confidential human source provided information and the FBI recorded it. Indeed, the FBI regularly receives information from sources with significant potential biases, motivations, and knowledge, including drug traffickers, members of organized crime, or even terrorists.` - [link](https://www.grassley.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/fbi_to_grassley_comer_-_biden_1023_response.pdf)
- On 20 June 2023, Chairman Comer’s and Senator Grassley released the FD-1023 from a Confidential Human Source (CHS) from 30 June 2020, alleging a conversation between Zlochevsky and the CHS that disclosed a figure for payment `to pay one Biden` being $5 million.
    - `Zlochevsky said he/Burisma would likely lose the trial because he could not show that Burisma was innocent; Zlochevsky also laughed at CHS's number of $50,000 (not because of the small amount, but because the number contained a "5") and said that "it costs (million) to pay one Biden, and 5 (million) to another Biden. • CHS noted that at this time, It was unclear to CHS whether these alleged payments were already made.` - [link](https://www.grassley.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/fd_1023_obtained_by_senator_grassley_-_biden.pdf)
    - `Regarding the seemingly open and unsolicited admissions by Pojarskii and Zlochevsky about the purpose for their retention of Hunter Biden, and the "forced0 payments Zlochevsky made to the Bidens, CHS explained it is very common for business men in post-Soviet countries to brag or show-off. Additionally, it is extremely common for businesses in Russia and Ukraine to make "bribe" payments to various government officials. CHS noted that in corporate budgets for other Russian and Ukrainian businesses which CHS has inspected in the past, CHS observed budget-line-items in Russian called "Podmazat" (transliterated by CHS), which literally translates to "oil, lubricate, or make things run smoothly," which companies routinely use to account for anticipated bribe payments. As such, given the pervasive necessity to bribe government officials in Ukraine and Russia, CHS did not perceive Pojarskii's or Zlochevsky's statements to be unusual, self-serving, or pretextual. Additionally, regarding Important business meetings, it is also common in Ukraine and Russia for persons to make covert recordings. However, CHS has only met Zlochevsky in person on one occasion and has spoken to him only twice on the telephone; as such, CHS is not able to provide any further opinion as to the veracity of Zlochevsky's aforementioned statements.` - [link](https://www.grassley.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/fd_1023_obtained_by_senator_grassley_-_biden.pdf)
- On 29 June 2023, Raskin re-released interview questions and answers from the 1st Trump Impeachment inquiry to Zlochevsky, asked by Lev Parnas contradicting the FD-1023.
    - `After receiving Mr. Zlochevsky’s responses, Mr. Parnas forwarded the document via text messages on July 8, 2019, respectively, to Mr. Giuliani and to Victoria Toensing, an attorney working in conjunction with Mr. Giuliani on his Ukrainian efforts to gather damaging information about the Bidens. Mr. Giuliani reportedly was “not satisfied” with Mr. Zlochevsky’s answers, and according to Mr. Parnas, was “furious” that Mr. Zlochevsky did not provide the factual support he wanted. The questions and answers by Mr. Zlochevsky set forth in the document include the following:`
      
      `Please detail any contacts you had with VP Joe Biden and his office from 2013 through 2019. Did Hunter ever facilitate any of those contacts?`
      
      `NO ONE FROM BURISMA EVER HAD ANY CONTACTS WITH VP BIDEN OR PEOPLE WORKING FOR HIM DURING HUNTER BIDEN'S ENGAGEMENT`
      
      `Did VP Biden or his staff assist you or your company in any way with business deals or meetings with world leaders or any other assistance?`
      
      `NO`
      
      `Did you ever become aware of documents suggesting $900k was paid to Hunter Biden for “lobbying” his father?`
      
      `NO` - [link](https://oversightdemocrats.house.gov/sites/democrats.oversight.house.gov/files/2023-06-29.JBR%20to%20Comer%20re%20Form-1023.pdf)
- On 24 July 2023, Raskin confirmed that the allegations in the FD-1023 CHS form didn’t warrant a preliminary or full investigation in August 2020 due to insufficient evidence and that the House committee was briefed on this on 5 June 2023, before Chairman Comer’s and Senator Grassley released the redacted form publicly. Raskin also reveals that the committee were warned about releasing the version of the FD-1023 with the limited redactions for personal safety reason for the CHS, which was ignored as being obstructive conduct from the FBI by Comer and Grassley.
    - `The FBI confirmed to Chairman Comer and Ranking Member Raskin during a June 5, 2023, briefing on the Form FD-1023 that the statements about purported corruption in the FD1023 are substantially the same allegations originally made by Rudy Giuliani. After Mr. Giuliani passed these allegations along to the Trump Department of Justice (DOJ), former President Trump’s Attorney General, William Barr, handpicked Scott Brady, then the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania, to investigate Mr. Giuliani’s allegations. Under U.S. Attorney Brady, the DOJ and FBI thoroughly investigated the allegations as part of an eight-month formal assessment, which included interviewing Mr. Giuliani and the CHS, and reviewing suspicious activity reports (SARs) from banks. The FBI also confirmed to Chairman Comer and Ranking Member Raskin during the June 5, 2023, briefing that Mr. Brady’s assessment was closed in August 2020 because his team found insufficient evidence to warrant escalating the probe from an assessment to a preliminary or full investigation.` - [link](https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000189-89a3-d9b3-abcf-c9aff4a70000) - Chairman Comer and Senator Grassley’s Decision to Publicly Release FBI Form FD-1023
    - `Chairman Comer’s and Senator Grassley’s release of the Form FD-1023 into the public domain revealed the names of several individuals in Ukraine whose identities the FBI had sought to protect. The version of the Form FD-1023 they decided to make public contains the same redactions as the version that the FBI made available to the Committee, except that it discloses the names of the individuals in Ukraine named by the CHS, as well as certain minor additional details such as specific locations, which were redacted in the FBI version. Chairman Comer and Senator Grassley chose to expose those additional details despite repeated cautioning from the FBI about the critical need to protect the safety of its human sources and its ability to conduct investigations effectively.  
          
        To justify the public release of the form, Senator Grassley and Chairman Comer claimed that the DOJ and FBI engaged in “obstructive conduct” by refusing to produce an unredacted version of the FD-1023 in response to Chairman Comer’s subpoena. Chairman Comer’s and Senator Grassley’s accusation ignores that last month the FBI provided a minimally redacted version of the form for in camera review by all Members of the Oversight Committee, following a series of additional accommodations the FBI had made to balance the provision of responsive information to the Committee with protecting its sources and the integrity of its investigations. Even before the FBI made the redacted Form FD-1023 available to the Committee, a whistle-blower had made the document available to Senator Grassley and Chairman Comer and appears to be the source of the version of the document released on Thursday.`

        - `Today, as part of the FBI’s continued accommodation to the Committee’s subpoena, the FBI produced to you, Ranking Member Raskin, and limited staff members an FD-1023 document that is responsive to the Committee’s subpoena. The document’s minimal redactions protect information that could potentially identify the confidential human source. In addition, two FBI senior executives provided a contextual briefing on the document, the importance of protecting the safety of human sources, and the integrity and effectiveness of the FBI’s confidential human source program, as discussed in our May 10, 2023 letter. The safeguards that FBI has placed on the production of this information are important, not only for the integrity of FBI investigations but also the protection and safety of our sources. Moreover, these safeguards—including in camera production and minimal redactions for identifying information—are routinely employed in responses to congressional requests and in court proceedings to protect interests like those the FBI must protect here.`
          
          `To be clear, wider disclosure of information that could potentially identify confidential human sources—whether alone or in conjunction with other information—could eliminate or chill important collection, undermine the FBI’s confidential human source program, jeopardize investigations, and result in significant risk of physical harm to sources based on their historic and ongoing collection. The contextual briefing provided to you, Ranking Member Raskin, and limited staff members with the appropriate security clearances, in confidence in a secure setting, further explained the significant public interest in protecting such information from wider disclosure and our duty to do so. Our confidential human sources put their physical safety at risk by voluntarily agreeing to provide us information, and we take our obligation to safeguard their identity extremely seriously.

Smirnov was scheduled to leave the United States two days later, on February 16, 2024, for a months-long, multi-country trip that, by his own description, involved meetings with officials of foreign intelligence agencies and governments. During his custodial interview on February 14, Smirnov admitted that officials associated with Russian intelligence were involved in passing a story about Businessperson 1.` - [United States of America v. Alexander Smirnov (Memorandum in Support of Detention), United States District Court for the District of Columbia, 2023](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nvd.167064/gov.uscourts.nvd.167064.15.0.pdf)
## Alexander Smirnov, the FD-1023 FBI CHS Indited
- On 14 February 2024, The FBI Confidential Human Source, Alexander Smirnov, who filed the original FD-1023 was charged with giving false statements and creating a false and fictitious record, namely the 2020 FD-1023.
    - `The Defendant’s 2020 story was a fabrication.`
      
      `The Defendant’s claim that “in late 2015/2016 during the Obama/Biden Administration” he first met with Burisma Official 2 and that at that meeting Burisma Official 2 told him that they hired Businessperson 1 to “protect us, through his dad, from all kinds of problems” was false, as he knew.`
      
      `Similarly, the Defendant’s claims that he met with Burisma Official 1 “one or two months later,” around the time “[Public Official 1] made a public statement about [the then-Ukrainian Prosecutor General] being corrupt, and that he should be fired/removed from office,” which occurred on December 9, 2015, and that at that meeting Burisma Official 1 admitted that he had paid Businessperson 1 $5 million and Public Official 1 $5 million each so that “[Businessperson 1] will take care of all those issues through his dad,” referring to the then-Ukrainian Prosecutor General’s investigation into Burisma, and to “deal with [the then-Ukrainian Prosecutor General],” were false, as the Defendant knew.`
      
      `No such statements were made to the Defendant because, in truth and fact, Defendant met with officials from Burisma for the first time in 2017, after Public Official 1 left office in January 2017, and after the then-Ukrainian Prosecutor General had been fired in February 2016. The first meeting the Defendant had with officials from Burisma occurred at a time when Public Official 1 no longer had the ability to influence U.S. policy and after the then-Ukrainian Prosecutor General was out of office. The Defendant’s story to the FBI was a fabrication, an amalgam of otherwise unremarkable business meetings and contacts that had actually occurred but at a later date than he claimed and for the purpose of pitching Burisma on the Defendant’s services and products, not for discussing bribes to Public Official 1 when he was in office.` - [United States of America v. Alexander Smirnov (Indictment), United States District Court for the District of Columbia, 2023](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24429138/govuscourtscacd91506210.pdf)
    - `Associate 1 never spoke to Burisma Official 1 on the phone, or in person. Therefore, the Defendant’s claim that Associate 1 called Burisma Official 1 in 2019 is false for that reason as well.`
      
      `Moreover, at no point when the Defendant was messaging the Handler in May 2020 about Public Official 1 did he mention that he had had two purported meetings when Public Official 1 was in office in the United States where Burisma executives told him that they paid Businessperson 1 to “protect us, through his dad, from all kinds of problems,” and later that they had specifically paid $5 million each to Public Official 1 and Businessperson 1 so that “[Businessperson 1] will take care of all those issues through his dad,” referring to a criminal investigation being conducted by the then-Ukrainian Prosecutor General into Burisma, and to “deal with” the then-Ukrainian Prosecutor General. Nor did he tell the Handler he had two subsequent phone calls where Burisma Official 1 told him that he had been forced to pay Public Official 1 and Businessperson 1 and that it would take investigators 10 years to find records of illicit payments to Public Official 1. This was despite the Defendant’s stated interest in proving to the Handler that the bribe had occurred and his offer to go to Ukraine to “meet with the guys” to obtain incriminating recordings of Businessperson 1 telling Burisma officials that his father would “take care” of the then-Ukrainian Prosecutor General.` - [United States of America v. Alexander Smirnov (Indictment), United States District Court for the District of Columbia, 2023](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24429138/govuscourtscacd91506210.pdf)
    - `On August 29, 2023, FBI investigators spoke with the Handler in reference to the 2020 1023. During that conversation, the Handler indicated that he and the Defendant had reviewed the 2020 1023 following its public release by members of Congress in July 2023, and the Defendant reaffirmed the accuracy of the statements contained in it.`
      
      `The Handler provided investigators with messages he had with the Defendant, including the ones described above. Additionally, the Handler identified and reviewed with the Defendant travel records associated with both Associate 2 and the Defendant. The travel records were inconsistent with what the Defendant had previously told the Handler that was memorialized in the 2020 1023. The Defendant also provided email communications with both Associate 2 and Burisma personnel beginning in 2017 to the Handler, which the Handler reviewed with the Defendant and shared with FBI investigators.` - [United States of America v. Alexander Smirnov (Indictment), United States District Court for the District of Columbia, 2023](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24429138/govuscourtscacd91506210.pdf)
    - `That on or about June 26, 2020, the defendant ALEXANDER SMIRNOV, did willfully and knowingly make a materially false, fictitious, and fraudulent statement and representation in a matter within the jurisdiction of the executive branch of the Government of the United States, to a special agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation at Los Angeles, California, in the Central District of California` - [United States of America v.

    - `Between on or about June 26 and 30, 2020, in the Central District of California, the defendant, ALEXANDER SMIRNOV, did knowingly cause the making of a false entry in an FBI Form 1023, a record and document, with the intent to impede, obstruct, and influence a matter that the Defendant knew and contemplated was within the jurisdiction of the United States Department of Justice, a department and agency of the United States, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1519, and Title 18, United States Code, Section 2.` - [United States of America v.

## IRS Whistle-blowers
- On 25 May 2023, Jim Jordan sends a letter to Garland asking for relevant documents to the removal of the IRS Whistle-blowers and their team.
    - `The Committee on the Judiciary is conducting oversight of the Department of Justice, including serious allegations of whistleblower retaliation. Recently, the Committee learned that the Department requested the removal of an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Criminal Supervisory Special Agent—who is also a whistleblower—and “his entire investigative team” from a “high-profile, controversial” ongoing investigation. The timing of the Department’s removal of the agent and investigative team raises serious concerns given that the investigation was the subject of the agent’s protected whistleblower disclosure. The Committee will not tolerate the Department’s retaliatory conduct against this or any other whistleblower.`
      
      `Whistleblowers play an integral part in identifying and rooting out waste, fraud, abuse, mismanagement, and corruption within federal agencies. Federal law protects whistleblowers from retaliation. The Department’s alleged efforts to remove an IRS whistleblower from an ongoing investigation could be a retaliatory action prohibited under United States law. Accordingly, to inform our ongoing oversight, we ask that please provide the following documentation and information:`
      
      `1. All documents and communications referring or relating to the removal on or around May 15, 2023, of an IRS Criminal Supervisory Special Agent and investigative team from an ongoing investigation;`
      
      `2. All documents and communications between or among the Department of Justice and Internal Revenue Service referring or relating to any investigations involving both the Department of Justice and Internal Revenue Service, from May 1, 2023, to the present;`
      
      `3. All documents and communications between or among the Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Delaware referring or relating to the removal on or around May 15, 2023, of any IRS Criminal Supervisory Special Agent and investigative team from an ongoing investigation.` - [Chairman Jim Jordan letter to United States Attorney David Weiss (25/05/23), House Committee on Oversight and Accountability and Committee on the Judiciary, 2023](https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/republicans-judiciary.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2023-05-25-jdj-to-garland-doj-re-irs-wb-retaliation.pdf)

- On 1 June 2023, Joseph Ziegler, a IRS criminal investigator, testified in a closed session to the House Ways and Means Committee.
    - ` ` [Transcript](https://waysandmeans.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Whistleblower-2-Transcript_Redacted.pdf)
- On 7 June 2023, on behalf of Garland, Weiss sends a letter to Jordan saying the DoJ declines in handing the information over due to an open matter, Weiss also states he has been granted ultimate authority over Hunter Biden matters.
	- `While your letter does not specify by name the ongoing investigation that is the subject of the Committee's oversight, its content suggests your inquiry is related to an investigation in my District. If my assumption is correct, I want to make clear that, as the Attorney General has stated, I have been granted ultimate authority over this matter, including responsibility for deciding where, when, and whether to file charges and for making decisions necessary to preserve the integrity of the prosecution, consistent with federal law, the Principles of Federal Prosecution, and Departmental regulations.`
      
	  `Your letter references recently-announced staffing determinations in the matter and the Committee's concern that those decisions intersect with whistleblower protections. I agree wholeheartedly that whistleblowers play an integral role in promoting both civil servant accountability and good government practices. Federal law protects whistleblowers from retaliation, as well it should.`
      
	  `The information sought by the Committee concerns an open matter about which the Department is not at liberty to respond. As then-Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein wrote in 2018 in response to a request for information from the Honorable Charles Grassley, Chairman of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary:`
      
	  `Congressional inquiries during the pendency of a matter pose an inherent threat to the integrity of the Department's law enforcement and litigation functions. Such inquiries inescapably create the risk that the public and the courts will perceive undue political and Congressional influence over law enforcement and litigation decisions. Such inquiries also often seek records and other information that our responsibilities for these matters preclude us from disclosing.`
      
	  `Accordingly, and consistent with longstanding Department of Justice policy and practice, I must respectfully decline the Committee's request for documents and information at this time to protect confidential law enforcement information from disclosure.` - [United States Attorney David Weiss letter to Chairman Jim Jordan (07/06/23), Department of Justice, 2023](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/23854516/20230607-out-jordan-investigation.pdf)
	- `In February 2021, I was asked to remain as United States Attorney for the District of Delaware to continue my oversight of the matter. Since that time, I have fulfilled my responsibilities, consistent with Department practices and procedures, and will continue to do so. Throughout my tenure as U.S. Attorney my decisions have been made-- and with respect to the matter must be made-- without reference to political considerations.` - [United States Attorney David Weiss letter to Chairman Jim Jordan (07/06/23), Department of Justice, 2023](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/23854516/20230607-out-jordan-investigation.pdf)
- On 10 July 2023, David Weiss said he never asked to be named a special counsel, disputing testimony to a House panel.
	- `David C. Weiss, the federal prosecutor in Delaware who has led the criminal investigation of Hunter Biden, on Monday rebutted a key element of testimony to Congress by an Internal Revenue Service official who said that Mr. Weiss complained about being blocked from pursuing the case the way he wanted.`
      
	  `In a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Mr. Weiss said that he had never asked Justice Department officials to give him special counsel status to pursue the case, contradicting testimony to the House Ways and Means Committee by the I.R.S. official, Gary Shapley, who said Mr. Weiss had sought that status and been turned down.`
      
	  `Mr. Weiss suggested that Mr. Shapley might have misunderstood him during an October 2022 meeting. Mr. Weiss, the U.S. attorney for Delaware, who was appointed to the role under President Donald J. Trump, said in the letter that he had approached a department higher-up about the possibility of requesting status as a special attorney, not as a special counsel.`
      
	  `Deputizing a federal prosecutor as a special attorney is distinct from making one a special counsel. The special attorney provision is, in essence, a workaround that allows an outsider to intervene in cases that span multiple jurisdictions or have special conditions. The special counsel regulations, by contrast, contain internal Justice Department reporting requirements and congressional oversight provisions.` - [David Weiss Rebuts I.R.S.

- On 22 June 2023, Jim Jordan sends a letter to Weiss stating that the denial of the request of documents has no legitimate basis to refuse cooperation.
    - `The Department has no legitimate basis to refuse cooperation with the Committee’s oversight of this matter. The Committee is empowered by the House of Representatives to conduct oversight of the programs and operations of the Department of Justice, and the Supreme Court has made clear that Congress has a “broad and indispensable” power to conduct oversight, which “encompasses inquiries into the administration of existing laws, studies of proposed laws, and surveys in our social, economic or political system for the purpose of enabling Congress to remedy them.”`
      
	  `Finally, the Committee’s May 25 letter was addressed to Attorney General Garland because it sought documents in possession of the broader Department of Justice, not solely the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Delaware. We reiterate those requests to the Department and expect to receive the responsive material promptly. In addition to the requests made in the Committee’s May 25 letter, and in light of the unusual nature of your response on behalf of Attorney General Garland, we ask that you provide the following information:`
      
	  `1. A list of individuals who drafted and assisted in drafting your June 7, 2023, response to the Committee’s May 25 letter;`
      
	  `2. Who instructed you to sign and send your June 7 letter to the Committee;`
      
	  `3. When you first learned or were made aware of the Committee’s May 25 letter to Attorney General Garland;`
      
	  `4. Who at the Department of Justice forwarded you the Committee’s May 25 letter to Attorney General Garland; and`
      
	  `5. Whether you had any discussions with Attorney General Garland or any other individual at the Department about the Committee’s May 25 letter. If so, please provide details of these conversations and/or documents or communications referring or relating to those conversations.` - [Chairman Jim Jordan letter to United States Attorney David Weiss (22/06/23), House Committee on Oversight and Accountability and Committee on the Judiciary, 2023](https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/republicans-judiciary.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2023-06-22-jdj-to-david-weiss-re-irs-whistleblower-retaliation.pdf)
- On 30 June 2023, Weiss sends a letter to Jordan saying he reaffirms the 7 June letter and expands on his ultimate authority stating if he requests Special Counsel, he would be granted it from Garland.
    - `At the outset, I would like to reaffirm the contents of the June 7 letter drafted by my office and reiterate that I am not at liberty to provide the materials you seek. The whistleblowers’ allegations relate to a criminal investigation that is now being prosecuted in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. At this juncture, I am required to protect confidential law enforcement information and deliberative communications related to the case. Thus, I will not provide specific information related to the Hunter Biden investigation at this time. But I will provide some general insight on two issues.`
      
      `First, the Department of Justice did not retaliate against “an Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) Criminal Supervisory Special Agent and whistleblower, as well as his entire investigative team… for making protected disclosures to Congress.”`
      
      `Second, in my June 7 letter I stated, “I have been granted ultimate authority over this matter, including responsibility for deciding where, when and whether to file charges and for making decisions necessary to preserve the integrity of the prosecution, consistent with federal law, the Principles of Federal Prosecution, and Departmental regulations.” I stand by what I wrote and wish to expand on what this means.`
      
      `As the U.S. Attorney for the District of Delaware, my charging authority is geographically limited to my home district. If venue for a case lies elsewhere, common Departmental practice is to contact the United States Attorney’s Office for the district in question and determine whether it wants to partner on the case. If not, I may request Special Attorney status from the Attorney General pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 515. Here, I have been assured that, if necessary after the above process, I would be granted § 515 Authority in the District of Columbia, the Central District of California, or any other district where charges could be brought in this matter.` - [United States Attorney David Weiss letter to Chairman Jim Jordan (30/06/23), Department of Justice, 2023](https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/07/2023.06.30-David-Weiss-1.pdf)
- On 12 September 2023, Thomas Sobocinski, an F.B.I. agent, told House investigators that the prosecutor overseeing the investigation into Hunter Biden never said he did not have full authority to pursue charges.
	- `A high-ranking F.B.I. agent has provided testimony to the House Judiciary Committee that contradicts a key claim made by an I.R.S. agent who said that political interference had hampered the investigation into the taxes of Hunter Biden, the president’s son, dealing a blow to House Republicans’ wide-ranging inquiry into the Biden administration.`
	  
	  `In closed-door testimony last week, Thomas Sobocinski, the special agent in charge of the Baltimore Field Office of the F.B.I., told House investigators that David C. Weiss, the U.S. attorney for Delaware overseeing the Justice Department’s inquiry into Hunter Biden, never said he did not have full authority to pursue charges against the president’s son, according to a transcript obtained by The New York Times.`
	  
	  `The testimony undercut a key claim from Gary Shapley, a veteran I.R.S. agent turned whistle-blower who has accused the Justice Department of giving Mr. Biden preferential treatment. It also buttressed the account of Mr. Weiss himself, who said he had “never been denied the authority to bring charges in any jurisdiction.”`
	  
	  `The news of Mr. Sobocinski’s account, coming on the same day Speaker Kevin McCarthy opened an impeachment inquiry into President Biden, drove home the often shaky nature of the evidence that Republicans are relying on to build a case that the president and his family are part of what Mr. McCarthy called “a culture of corruption.”` - [F.B.I. Agent Undercuts Claims of Political Interference in Hunter Biden Inquiry, The New York Times, 2023](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/12/us/politics/hunter-biden-thomas-sobocinski-testimony.html)
- On 18 September 2023, Hunter Biden files charges against the IRS Whistle-blowers claiming violation of privacy and unlawful disclosure of tax information.
    - `Plaintiff Robert Hunter Biden (“Mr. Biden” or “Plaintiff”), by and through his undersigned counsel, brings this action against the United States Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS” or “Defendant”), to seek redress for the (1) unlawful disclosure of Mr. Biden’s confidential tax return information in violation of 26 U.S.C. § 6103 and 28 U.S.C. § 7431, and (2) willful and intentional failure to establish appropriate administrative, technical, and/or physical safeguards over the IRS’s records system to insure the security and confidentiality of Mr. Biden’s confidential tax return information in violation of the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552a.` [Robert Hunter Biden v.

## Weiss on Possible Testimony
- On 29 June 2023, Jordan and Smith sends a letter to Garland requesting first hand testimony from 11 DoJ employees given to the committee by Shapley & Zielger.
    - `From recent testimony before the Ways and Means Committee, we have identified several Department employees who we believe to possess information concerning allegations of politicization and misconduct with respect to the Department’s investigation of Hunter Biden. Specifically, the Committees seek to examine whistleblower claims that the Department’s investigation of Hunter Biden was purposely slow-walked and subjected to improper and politically motivated interference. The Committees must obtain the first-hand testimony from these individuals to fully assess the serious allegations raised by these brave IRS whistleblowers. Accordingly, we ask that you initially make the following Department employees available for transcribed interviews before the Judiciary Committee promptly:`
      
      `Lesley Wolf, Jack Morgan, Mark Daly, Matthew Graves, E. Martin Estrada, David Weiss, Stuart Goldberg, Shawn Weede, Shannon Hanson, Tom Sobocinski (FBI), Ryeshia Holley (FBI)`
      
      `We anticipate that we may require testimony from additional Department or FBI employees as our oversight continues, and we expect your cooperation in facilitating these future interviews as well. To the extent that the Department attempts to interfere with our oversight by asserting that line-level employees are off-limits to congressional oversight, please be advised that we will not accept that excuse. Congressional committees have regularly received testimony from non Senate-confirmed and line-level Justice Department employees in the past. We expect this past precedent to apply to our oversight in this matter as well.` - [Chairman Jim Jordan and Chairman Jason Smith letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland (29/06/23), House Committee on Oversight and Accountability and Committee on the Judiciary, 2023](https://waysandmeans.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/062923-JDJ-JS-JC-to-Garland-re-TI-requests.pdf)
- On 13 July 2023, Garland sends a letter to Jordan restating that there is an open matter and that Weiss has ultimate authority.
    - `U.S. Attorney Weiss has clearly stated that he has been "granted ultimate authority over this matter, including responsibility for deciding where, when and whether to file charges and for making decisions necessary to preserve the integrity of the prosecution, consistent with federal law, the Principles of Federal Prosecution, and Departmental regulations." He has said he has "never been denied the authority to bring charges in any jurisdiction." U.S. Attorney Weiss has assured that his "decisions have been made—and with respect to the matter must be made without reference to political considerations."` - [Attorney General Merrick Garland letter to Chairman Jim Jordan (13/07/23), Department of Justice, 2023](https://twitter.com/pbump/status/1679618921362599936)
    - `The Office of Legislative Affairs will work with your staff to discuss the appropriate timing and scope for providing further information from U.S. Attorney Weiss. In determining the timing and scope, the Department must consider the integrity of the ongoing criminal investigation and prosecution and the Department's longstanding policy that we seek "whenever possible to provide information about closed, rather than open, matters. Indeed, legal barriers and ethics obligations prevent the Department from discussing the particulars of a criminal prosecution while it remains pending in court.` - [Attorney General Merrick Garland letter to Chairman Jim Jordan (13/07/23), Department of Justice, 2023](https://twitter.com/pbump/status/1679618921362599936)
- On 21 July 2023, Jordan and Smith sends a letter to Garland stating there are contradictions in the authority Weiss has that the Committee would like Weiss to testify.
    - `In other words, in his first letter, Weiss represented to the Judiciary Committee that he had been granted ultimate authority with respect to the filing of charges. But in his second letter, Weiss told the Committee that he had been assured by unnamed officials that he would be granted that authority in the future if necessary after going through a specified process, and he notably provided no explanation of who would make the determination of necessity. These are inconsistent representations, and it is not possible for both of them to be true.`
      
      `Weiss’s shifting statements about his authority to bring charges against Hunter Biden, especially his authority to bring charges outside of Delaware, suggest that improper political considerations factored into the Department’s investigative and prosecutorial function. In addition, at least some of Weiss’s statements to the Judiciary Committee contradict his own statement to line-level investigators in October 2022, in which he indicated that he was not the “deciding official” on bringing charges against Hunter Biden. This statement was memorialized contemporaneously in an email sent by IRS whistleblower Gary Shapley; and none of the other participants in the meeting at which Weiss made this assertion have contradicted Shapley’s account.`
      
      `On a recent teleconference with Judiciary Committee staff, the Department confirmed that Weiss would appear before the Committee. While we look forward to Weiss appearing at a hearing at the appropriate time, we must first conduct our investigative work, including conducting the transcribed interview of witnesses identified in our June 29 letter. As we explained in that letter, the Department has made available non-Senate-confirmed and line-level employees for testimony to Congress in the past, and we expect no deviation from this precedent in this matter. Accordingly, we write to reiterate our outstanding requests for transcribed interviews with the Department and FBI officials listed in our June 29 letter.` - [Chairman Jim Jordan and Chairman Jason Smith letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland (21/07/23), House Committee on Oversight and Accountability and Committee on the Judiciary, 2023](https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/republicans-judiciary.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2023-07-21-jdj-js-jc-to-garland-re-doj-response.pdf)
- On 24 July 2023, Assistant Attorney General Carlos Felipe Uriarte sends a letter to Chairman Comer informing that David Weiss would be available for congressional testimony if requested.
    - `The Department believes it is strongly in the public interest for the American people and for Congress to hear directly from U.S. Attorney Weiss on these assertions and questions about his authority at a public hearing. To address these issues, U.S. Attorney Weiss is available to appear at a public hearing before the Committee, consistent with the law and Department policy, after the House returns from its August district work period. U.S. Attorney Weiss is available on September 27, September 28, October 18, and October 19. To be clear, the most appropriate time for any testimony on these subjects is after the matter is closed, especially under the circumstances where the matter is pending before a court and subject to judicial supervision, not to mention legal and ethical bars that limit what the Department can say while the matter is pending in court. While testimony at this early juncture must be appropriately limited to protect the ongoing matter and important confidentiality interests, the Department acknowledges your stated interest in addressing aspects of this matter in the near term, such as U.S. Attorney Weiss’s authority and jurisdiction to bring charges wherever he deems appropriate.` - [Assistant Attorney General Carlos Felipe Uriarte letter to Chairman James Comer (24/07/23), Department of Justice, 2023](https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000189-8a0b-dda6-a3c9-aa4b83510000)
## Devon Archer Testimony
- On 31 July 2023, the Committee on Oversight and Accountability interviewed Hunter Biden’s business partner Devon Archer.
- Archer testifies that Hunter or Burisma had no influence on Joe Biden and U.S. foreign policy
    - `Q You -- do you have any basis to disagree with the conclusion that "Hunter Biden's presence on the board of the Ukrainian gas company Burisma had no effect on U.S. foreign policy"?`
      
      `A Not directly. You mean like making laws? I don't -- I don't think so.`
      
      `Mr. Goldman. Foreign policy.`
      
      `Mr. Archer. No -- no -- no on foreign policy.`
      
      `Q No basis to disagree with that conclusion.`
      
      `A No.`
      
      `Q Do you have any basis to disagree with the conclusion that "Hunter Biden's role did not influence U.S. foreign policy decisions"?`
      
      `A I have -- yeah, I have no basis.`
      
      `Q Do you have any basis to disagree with the conclusion that "Vice President Biden carried out U.S. foreign policy in the interest of the United States"?`
      
      `A I have no basis to judge.`
      
      `Q Or to disagree with that.`
      
      `A Or disagree.`
      
      `Q You have no knowledge -- nothing based on your knowledge or experience contradicts this conclusion.`
      
      `A No.`
      
      `Q Does anything in your knowledge or experience contradict the conclusion that "there was no corruption, wrongdoing, or impropriety on the part of Vice President Biden"?`
      
      `A I have no basis to know.`
      
      `Q The report also found, quote, "No --"`
      
      `Mr. Goldman. I'm sorry. You have no basis to know or is that a no?`
      
      `Mr. Archer. I have -- I have -- I would have no idea.`
      
      `Mr. Goldman. No basis --`
      
      `Mr. Schwartz. Are you aware of any wrongdoing by Vice President Biden?`
      
      `Mr. Archer. No, I'm not aware of any.`
      
      `Q So based on your knowledge and experience, you have no evidence that would contradict any of these conclusions I just read.`
      
      `A No.`
      
      `Q The report also found, quote, "No evidence that any action of the U.S. Government or any U.S. official was taken to benefit Burisma or Hunter Biden." Do you have any evidence or knowledge that contradicts this conclusion?`
      
      `A No.`
      
      `Q So based on everything you saw, heard, and observed, did you have any knowledge of Joe Biden having any involvement with Burisma?`
      
      `A No -- not direct, no.`
      
      `Q No involvement of Joe --`
      
      `A No.`
      
      `Q -- Biden with Burisma.`
      
      `A No. My only thought is that I think Burisma would have gone out of business if it didn't have the brand attached to it. That's my, like, only honest opinion. But I have no basis for any -- never heard any conversations --`
      
      `Mr. Goldman. But that's different than Joe Biden's action.`
      
      `Mr. Archer. Right.` - [Devon Archer Deposition Transcript, House Committee on Oversight and Accountability and Committee on the Judiciary, 2024](https://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Devon-Archer-Transcript.pdf)
- Archer testifies that he disagree with the FD 1023 report on the alleged bribe to Joe Biden
    - `Q If someone were to conclude from this that this is evidence, this Form 1023 is evidence that Joe Biden was bribed by Mykola Zlochevsky, would you disagree with that conclusion?`
      
      `A Yeah, I would.`
      
      ` Q So in talking about how Zlochevsky and other Ukrainian businessmen brag --`
      
      `A Uh-huh.`
      
      `Q -- exaggerate, tell fibs, is that fair?`
      
      `A Yep, very similar to D.C. operators.`
      
      `Q Similar to D.C. operators. In another sense, you know, is it fair to say that people in D.C. like to give off the impression of access that they don't necessarily actually deliver on?`
      
      `A Yep, correct. And in Ukraine, in Russia they brag about how much -- they brag about bigger bribes than they actually give. So it's pretty kind of similar symbiosis there.`  - [Devon Archer Deposition Transcript, House Committee on Oversight and Accountability and Committee on the Judiciary, 2024](https://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Devon-Archer-Transcript.pdf)
- Archer testifies that he has no knowledge of Hunter ever calling Joe about business.
    - `Mr. Jordan. The request from Mr. -- from Mykola Zlochevsky and Vadym to Mr. Biden and/or if you said it was to you, the request for help from whom to deal with what pressure?`
      
      `Mr. Archer. The request -- you know, basically the request is like, can D.C. help? But there were not -- you know, I'm not going to -- there were not -- it wasn't like -- there weren't specific, you know, can the big guy help? It was -- it's always this amorphous, can we get help in D.C.?`
      
      `Mr. Jordan. The request was help from the United States Government to deal with the pressure they were under from their prosecutor, and that entailed the freezing of assets at the London bank and other things that were going on in Ukraine?`
      
      `Mr. Archer. Correct.`
      
      `Mr. Jordan. Okay.`
      
      `Mr. Biggs. I just -- I think you might have just clarified. I just want to make sure.`
      
      `Mr. Archer. Sure.`
      
      `Mr. Biggs. When you say D.C. help, like they said, we could use some D.C. help, I'm not asking what you think they -- I'm asking what you interpreted that to mean?`
      
      `Mr. Archer. Well, I'm still learning about it, but it seems like -- really a lot like at the end of the day lobbying, you know, soft lobbying help, firm lobbying help. I mean, there was constant, you know, constant pressure on them, and there were various service providers hired and people working on, you know, help in D.C. A lot of power is obviously flexed here. So that was a -- that was a constant, you know, whether it was putting out fires or helping expand.`
      
      `Mr. Biggs. So why do you think they were asking Mr. Biden for D.C. help if they had -- I'm assuming what you're saying is they might have had some kind of lobbying group on retainer, perhaps.`
      
      `Mr. Archer. Yes.`
      
      `Mr. Biggs. So why do you think they were asking Hunter Biden for D.C. help?`
      
      `Mr. Archer. I mean, why?`
      
      `Mr. Biggs. I mean, what did you take away from that?`
      
      `Mr. Archer. Well, I mean, he was a lobbyist and an expert and obviously he carried, you know, a very powerful name. So I think it was -- that's what they were asking for. They had -- they also -- you know, there was a firm, Blue Star Strategies, that was hired to be, you know, kind of the -- I don't know if they were a lobbying firm or just strategic advisory. It's still unclear what the difference is. But, you know, that was part of the mix. But it was -- yeah, it was a high-pressure environment, and there was -- there was constant requests for help.`
      
      `BY MR. MANDOLFO:`
      
      `Q What did Hunter Biden do after he was given that request?`
      
      `A Listen, I did not hear this phone call, but he -- he called his dad.`
      
      `Q How do you know that?`
      
      `A Because he -- because I think Vadym told me. But, again, it's unclear. I just know that there was a call that happened there and I was not privy to it.`
      
      `Q What did Vadym tell you about the call?`
      
      `A Just that -- just that they -- "We called D.C." But he didn't -- you know, again, it's not like the -- there was not a -- there was not, "Oh, we've got all our problems solved" kind of, you know, revelation. I was -- I was not on that side of the equation and kind of working on the lobbying side of the business.`
      
      `Q When Vadym told you this, where were you?`
      
      `A I was -- you know, basically what -- then we drove back to the hotel I was staying at.`
      
      `Q Who's "we"?`
      
      `A Me, Vadym, and Mykola.`
      
      `Q Was it during that drive back that Vadym told you that Hunter Biden had called VP Biden at that time?`
      
      `A It would have been at some point there or after. You know, maybe the next day. Again, we spent -- you know, on a board trip where you travel with people from all over the world, we spent 3 days together. So the exact time I can't say, but that was the -- that was the -- that was -- that's what happened.`
      
      `Mr. Schwartz. He told you expressly he called his father or that he called D.C.?`
      
      `Mr. Archer. D.C., D.C.` - [Devon Archer Deposition Transcript, House Committee on Oversight and Accountability and Committee on the Judiciary, 2024](https://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Devon-Archer-Transcript.pdf)
# Biden Impeachment Inquiry
- On 12 September 2023, McCarthy announced the direction to open an Impeachment inquiry.
    - `Speaker Kevin McCarthy announced Tuesday he is directing the U.S. House to open an impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden over his family’s business dealings, launching historic proceedings ahead of the 2024 election.`
      
      `McCarthy said that House investigations so far “paint a picture of a culture of corruption” around the Biden family as Republicans probe the business dealings of the president’s son, Hunter Biden, from before the Democratic president took office.`
      
      `“These are allegations of abuse of power, obstruction and corruption, and they warrant further investigation by the House of Representatives,” McCarthy, R-Calif., said at the Capitol, announcing he was directing the House led by the Oversight Committee “to open a formal impeachment inquiry.”` - [Speaker McCarthy directs the House to open an impeachment inquiry into President Biden, AP News, 2023](https://apnews.com/article/mccarthy-biden-impeachment-shutdown-house-republicans-b187202be8814f7acbdd6e2e937e23d4)
## Hunter Biden Testimony
- On 28 February 2024, Hunter Biden appeared in front of the Committees representing the impeachment inquiry.
    - `Mr. Biden. Thank you.`
      
      `I am here today to provide the committees with the one uncontestable fact that should end the false premise of this inquiry: I did not involve my father in my business, not while I was a practicing lawyer, not in my investments or transactions, domestic or international, not as a board member, and not as an artist, never.`
      
      `You read this fact in the many letters that have been sent to you over the last year as part of your so-called impeachment investigation. You heard this fact when I said it weeks ago standing outside of this building. You heard this fact from a parade of other witnesses, former colleagues, and business partners of mine, including my uncle, who has testified before you in similar proceedings. And now, today, you hear this fact directly from me.`
      
      `For more than a year, your committees have hunted me in your partisan political pursuit of my dad. You have trafficked in innuendo, distortion, and sensationalism, all the while ignoring the clear and convincing evidence staring you in the face: You do not have evidence to support the baseless and MAGA-motivated conspiracies about my father because there isn't any.` - [Hunter Biden Deposition Transcript, House Committee on Oversight and Accountability and Committee on the Judiciary, 2024](https://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Hunter-Biden-Transcript_Redacted.pdf)

# Criminal Inditements & Charges
## Hunter Biden
### Tax Fraud Indictment
- On 9 December 2020, Hunter Biden announced that he had been under investigation since late 2018 for potential criminal violations of tax and money laundering laws.
    - `The Justice Department is investigating the tax affairs of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s son Hunter, he disclosed in a statement on Wednesday.`
      
      `The investigation is being led by the U.S. attorney’s office in Delaware. It was opened in late 2018 and has included inquiries into potential criminal violations of tax and money laundering laws, according to people familiar with the inquiry. The money laundering aspect of the case failed to gain traction after F.B.I. agents were unable to gather enough evidence for a prosecution, the people said.`
      
      `“I learned yesterday for the first time that the U.S. attorney’s office in Delaware advised my legal counsel, also yesterday, that they are investigating my tax affairs,” Hunter Biden said in a statement. “I take this matter very seriously, but I am confident that a professional and objective review of these matters will demonstrate that I handled my affairs legally and appropriately, including with the benefit of professional tax advisers.”`
      
      `The inquiry was focused on Hunter Biden and some of his associates, not the president-elect or other family members, two people familiar with it said. On Tuesday, prosecutors in Delaware served subpoenas, including at least one that sought information related to Hunter Biden’s taxes, two people familiar with the matter said.` - [Hunter Biden Discloses He Is Focus of Federal Tax Inquiry, The New York Times, 2020](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/09/us/politics/hunter-biden-tax-investigation.html)
- On 12 December 2020, the Wall Street Journal reported that Trump asked Barr for a Special Counsel investigation into Hunter Biden and that Trump was `enraged` that Barr knew for months that Hunter was under investigation without Trumps knowledge, and that Barr didn’t publicly announce the investigation leading to some angry tweets directed at Barr.
    - `Senior White House officials have also discussed the possibility of pursuing a special counsel to investigate Hunter Biden, expressing frustration over Attorney General William Barr’s handling of investigations into Mr. Biden’s business and financial dealings and concern that the incoming administration of Joe Biden could seek to shut down any probes into Mr. Biden’s son, Hunter, an administration official said.`
      
      `The White House declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Mr. Barr declined to comment. A spokesman for the Biden transition team declined to comment. Joe Biden isn’t implicated in the investigations into Hunter Biden, according to people familiar with the matter.` - [Trump Pursues Appointing Special Counsel to Probe Election, Hunter Biden, Wall Street Journal, 2020](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-pursues-appointing-special-counsel-to-probe-election-hunter-biden-11607744814)
    - `According to the report, Barr had known “for months” that Hunter Biden was being investigated but rightly declined to inform the president or the public. Axios followed up on the Journal’s scoop, reporting that President Trump was “enraged” by the news and immediately “began re-exploring options for replacing Barr” and appointing a special counsel to look into the President-elect’s eldest son.`
      
      `Trump on Saturday morning lashed out at Barr in a series of tweets, deriding the nation’s top law enforcement official for not publicly disclosing that the Department of Justice had been investigating his Democratic opponent’s son for possible financial crimes. The president first boosted a conservative radio host’s call for Barr to be “fired by the end of business today” if he was in fact aware of the Hunter Biden investigation since last year, re-tweeting the post with the caption “A big disappointment.”`
      
      `Things continued to spiral downward from there, with Trump blaming Barr for hurting Republicans in the 2020 election by following DOJ protocol regarding ongoing investigations and keeping the probe under wraps.`
      
      `“If Biden gets in, nothing will happen to Hunter or Joe. Barr will do nothing, and the new group of partisan killers coming in will quickly kill it all. Same thing with Durham. We caught them cold, spying, treason & more (the hard part), but “Justice” took too long. Will be DOA!,” Trump tweeted.`
      
      `“Why didn’t Bill Barr reveal the truth to the public, before the Election, about Hunter Biden. Joe was lying on the debate stage that nothing was wrong, or going on – Press confirmed. Big disadvantage for Republicans at the polls!”` - [Trump Looks to Fire Bill Barr, Appoint Special Counsel: Report, Law & Crime, 2020](https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/trump-looks-to-fire-bill-barr-and-appoint-special-counsel-to-pursue-election-fraud-hunter-biden-report/)
- On 12 December 2020, Barr says a Special Counsel was not needed for the Hunter Biden investigation.
    - `Outgoing Attorney General William Barr said Monday that he saw no reason for a special counsel to take over the criminal investigation of Hunter Biden, son of President-elect Joe Biden, undercutting President Donald Trump yet again.`
      
      `Trump has mulled pushing the Justice Department to appoint a special counsel for the probe, which is focused on Hunter Biden’s taxes, and which is currently being handled by the U.S. attorney’s office in Delaware.`
      
      `“To the extent that there’s an investigation, I think that it’s being handled responsibly and professionally within the department,” Barr said at a news conference, two days before his resignation from the Department of Justice takes effect.`
      
      ` “And to this point I have seen no reason to appoint a special counsel, and I see no reason to do so before I leave,” Barr said.`
      
      `“If I thought a special counsel was the right tool, I would name one, but I haven’t.”`
      
      `Barr also said that he hopes the Biden administration will handle the Hunter Biden probe “responsibly.”` - [Attorney General Barr won't name special counsel for Hunter Biden probe, CNBC, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/21/attorney-general-barr-wont-name-special-counsel-for-hunter-biden-probe.html)
