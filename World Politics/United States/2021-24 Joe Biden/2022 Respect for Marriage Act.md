### 2022 Respect for Marriage Act
- On 26 June 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Obergefell v. Hodges that the 14th Amendment requires all U.S. states to recognize same-sex marriages.
    
    > `These considerations lead to the conclusion that the right to marry is a fundamental right inherent in the liberty of the person, and under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment couples of the same-sex may not be deprived of that right and that liberty. The Court now holds that same-sex couples may exercise the fundamental right to marry. No longer may this liberty be denied to them. Baker v. Nelson must be and now is overruled, and the State laws challenged by Petitioners in these cases are now held invalid to the extent they exclude same-sex couples from civil marriage on the same terms and conditions as opposite-sex couples.` [link](https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/crt/legacy/2015/06/26/obergefellhodgesopinion.pdf)
    
- On 24 June 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Dobbs v. Jackson that the Constitution does not confer a right to abortion. The court's decision overruled both Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, giving individual states the power to regulate any aspect of abortion not protected by federal law.
    
    > `The Constitution does not prohibit the citizens of each State from regulating or prohibiting abortion. Roe and Casey arrogated that authority. We now overrule those decisions and return that authority to the people and their elected representatives. The judgment of the Fifth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392_6j37.pdf)
    
- Associate Justice Thomas argued further that the Court should go further in future cases, reconsidering other past Supreme Court cases that granted rights based on substantive due process, one of which included Obergefell v. Hodges.
    
    > `For that reason, in future cases, we should reconsider all of this Court’s substantive due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell. Because any substantive due process decision is “demonstrably erroneous,”, we have a duty to “correct the error” established in those precedents. After overruling these demonstrably erroneous decisions, the question would remain whether other constitutional provisions guarantee the myriad rights that our substantive due process cases have generated.` [link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392_6j37.pdf)
    
- On 13 December 2022, Biden signed the Respect for Marriage Act which requires the U.S. federal government and all U.S. states and territories to recognize the validity of same-sex and interracial civil marriages in the United States, and protects religious liberty.
    
    > `(a) For the purposes of any Federal law, rule, or regulation in which marital status is a factor, an individual shall be considered  
    > married if that individual’s marriage is between 2 individuals and is valid in the State where the marriage was entered into or, in the case of a marriage entered into outside any State, if the marriage is between 2 individuals and is valid in the place where entered into and the marriage could have been entered into in a State.  
    >   
    > (b) In this section, the term ‘State’ means a State, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or any other territory or possession of the United States.  
    >   
    > (c) For purposes of subsection (a), in determining whether a marriage is valid in a State or the place where entered into, if outside of any State, only the law of the jurisdiction applicable at the time the marriage was entered into may be considered.`
