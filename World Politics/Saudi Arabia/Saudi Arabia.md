### 1915-18 Sinai and Palestine Campaign
- On 28 January 1915 - 30 October 1918, The Sinai and Palestine campaign was part of the Middle Eastern theatre of World War I. The British Empire, the French Third Republic, and the Kingdom of Italy fought alongside the [[Israel-Palestine Contents Page]] in opposition to the Ottoman Empire, the German Empire, and the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
### 1915 Raid on the Suez Canal
- On 28 January 1915 - 4 February 1915, The Raid on the Suez Canal, took place when a German-led Ottoman Army force advanced from Southern Palestine to attack the British Empire-protected Suez Canal, marking the beginning of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of World War 1.
- On 28 January 1915, Turkish forces were spotted not far from the stationed British forces along the Suez Canal.
    
    > `On 28 January, British aircraft located a Turkish force of up to 4,000 men some eight miles east of Deversoir (in the central sector), which confirmed the British view that the main Turkish attack would fall in the centre, probably in the area between Serapeum (four miles south of Lake Timsah) and El Ferdan (seven miles north of Ismailia). This warning gave the British time to reinforce the trenches on the key sections of the west bank, drawing on reserves which had been assembled close to the canal. British and French warships entered the canal and took up their stations.` [[link]](https://archive.org/details/lastcrusadepales0000bruc/mode/2up?view=theater) - The Last Crusade: The Palestine Campaign in the First World War, Anthony Bruce
    
- On 1 February 1915, the first shots were fired from the British to the Turkish forces.
    
    > `On 1 February, HMS Clio opened fire on enemy units in the desert east of El Ferdan.  
    >   
    > By the beginning of February, some 15,000 Turkish troops had passed along the central Sinai route and arrived in the Ismailia area. They had been served well by their Bedouin guides and not a single Turkish soldier (or animal) lost his life. As elsewhere on the canal, the great majority of the British defending force was entrenched on the west bank, but defensive positions had also been built on the east side. In the central sector, there were five such posts, each manned by two companies of Indian infantry. On the west bank, between Lake Timsah and the Great Bitter Lake, there were twelve posts, each manned by two platoons. Each platoon was responsible for the defence of about 600 yards of canal frontage. These defensive arrangements were supported by a reserve of three companies, based at Serapeum, and two gun batteries.`

- On 3 February 1915, the raid on the Suez Canal begins.
    
    > `The sandstorm continued into the night and only in the early hours of 3 February could the Turkish assault on the canal begin. British troops at an observation post at Tussum provided the first evidence of the final preparations for an enemy attack. At 3.25 a.m., members of the Turkish 25th Division, an Arab unit, passed southeast of the post in the direction of the canal, apparently in relatively good order at this point. Not long after Turkish troops had been observed at Tussum, the British saw the enemy making its first attempt to cross the canal. In the words of the official historian, ‘dark masses were discerned moving slowly down the gullies on the east bank towards the water. Presently these masses were discovered to be pontoons and rafts carried by squads of men.’` [[link]](https://archive.org/details/lastcrusadepales0000bruc/mode/2up?view=theater) - The Last Crusade: The Palestine Campaign in the First World War, Anthony Bruce
    
- The Ottoman Suez Expeditionary Force suffered the loss of some 1,500 men including 716 prisoners and the British had a low casualty rate due to the Turkish attempts of surprising the British failing by being spotted early by HMS Clio.
    
    > `British inaction gave the Turks time to consider their next move. Although they had suffered the loss of some 1,500 men, including 716 taken prisoner, their 10th Division remained unscathed. However, morale had undoubtedly been damaged by the failure of their first operation to make any impact either on the canal or its defences. Nor was there any sign of a popular response to the invasion within Egypt itself, and it was evident that no assistance from that direction could be expected in the future. Without such popular support, the wider objectives of the invasion could not be achieved, given the marked imbalance in strength of the opposing forces. In his account of the Sinai campaign, Kress claimed that  
    >   
    > 'Djemal Pasha had expected that his appearance on the canal would be followed by a rising of the Egyptian nationalists. In this hope he was deceived. There remained, however, an attainable goal, to force his way suddenly astride the canal, hold the crossing for a few days, and in that time close the canal permanently.'  
    >   
    > However, without the element of surprise, even this more limited objective remained beyond the Turkish army’s grasp.`  
    > [[link]](https://archive.org/details/lastcrusadepales0000bruc/mode/2up?view=theater) - The Last Crusade: The Palestine Campaign in the First World War, Anthony Bruce
    
- On 3 February 1915, The Commander-In-Chief of the Ottoman-Turkish Forces in the Syria and Palestine regions orders a retreat of the forces to prevent further casualties.
    
    > `Djemal Pasha, commander-in-chief in Syria and Palestine, had accompanied the invasion force to the canal and it was he who, on 3 February, decided that an orderly withdrawal was all that could now be achieved. Although he had little talent as a soldier, he was realistic enough to recognize that renewing the attack could result in the complete destruction of the Turkish force and a further heavy blow to Turkish prestige. The only consolation for the Turks was the fact that the invasion force had been able to disengage without difficulty and return to its forward base without any interference by the British.` [[link]](https://archive.org/details/lastcrusadepales0000bruc/mode/2up?view=theater) - The Last Crusade: The Palestine Campaign in the First World War, Anthony Bruce
    
- Attempts to minimize the loss of the raid were attempted by the Turks and Germans by trying to redefine the purpose for the raid on the Suez Canal.
    
    > `Later the Turks and their German allies would try to minimize the stated purpose of the expedition, claiming that it was no more than a reconnaissance or an attempt to destroy part of the fabric of the canal. Even if such rationalizations are accepted, the methods employed were hardly equal to the task. For reasons that are not clear they used their weaker division in the attack and kept the stronger 10th Division in reserve. (This latter division was used at no time during the invasion.) Moreover their diversionary actions to the north and south were weak and unconvincing, and failed to draw British troops away from the main expected area of attack. The Turks were thus obliged to face the full strength of the defending forces when they attacked the British centre. The results, according to Yigal Sheffy, a specialist in the history of military intelligence, were fatal to the Turkish cause:  
    >   
    > ”Had Cemal [Djemal Pasha] implemented the principle of force optimization by bringing in the sizeable force available in the rear, invested his better trained troops in the first wave, and pressed the defenders on the flanks, he would have had a much better prospect for securing the east bank opposite Serapeum and establishing a beachhead on the west bank.”  
    >   
    > Given that the capture of the canal was possibly the most valuable contribution it could have made to the cause of its allies, it seems likely that the Turkish army’s half-hearted attack with insignificant numbers had a wider political explanation.`

### 1917 Tel Aviv & Jaffa Deportation
- In March - April 1917, The Tel Aviv and Jaffa deportation was the evacuation of 10,000 people from Jaffa, including Tel Aviv, by the authorities of the Ottoman Empire in Palestine. This was a reaction to the [[Israel-Palestine Contents Page]] & [[Israel-Palestine Contents Page]] Gaza Battles and the Jewish inhabitants possibly assisting the British forces.
- The Commander-In-Chief of the Ottoman-Turkish Forces in the Syria and Palestine regions was possibly concerned about Jewish inhabitants assisting the British forces. The Yishuv organised a crisis committee to help reduce the possible catastrophe with the deportation and has been attributed to reducing the human toll.
    
    > `At the end of March 1917, on the threshold of the Pesach festival, the Jewish community of Tel Aviv and Jaffa was ordered to evacuate their homes. Fully one-fifth of the evacuees perished, owing to the difficult conditions of the transfer. Djemal Pasha justified the order by the threat of British naval attacks on the community. Since no similar orders were issued to Haifa or Beirut, it is probable that he was concerned with the assistance the Jews would offer the already advancing British troops. The vicious and ruthless manner in which the order was carried out exemplify Djemal Pasha’s attitude towards his subjects.  
    >   
    > When the extent of the economic depression and political oppression was realized, a “‘crisis-relief committee’ was formed in Jaffa headed by Meir Dizengoff, the mayor of Tel Aviv. Various emergency measures were taken to relieve the widespread suffering and hunger. Public kitchens were established, all available land was sown for additional food, and the communities of the Galilee and Samaria — which were relatively mildly affected — were asked to share their produce with their less fortunate brethren.  
    >   
    > The committee was also active in minimizing the anguish of the banished foreign nationals. Often family members became separated at the point of departure, and not even the committee’s good offices, contacts, and bribes could influence sadistic officials to permit their reunion. The evacuation of Jaffa and Tel Aviv would have been even more costly in terms of human lives, were it not for the efforts of Dizengoff and his committee who organized the evacuation in an orderly manner.`  
    > [[link]](https://archive.org/details/inshadowofstrugg0000birn/mode/1up?view=theater) - In the shadow of the struggle, Ervin Birnbaum
    
- New Historian Tom Segev wrote a piece for Haaretz in 2009 on the deportation.
    
    > `In the spring of 1917, roads in the south of the country overflowed with tens of thousands of refugees. The Turks who then ruled the land had expelled them from Gaza. It happened after the British had twice failed in their attempts to conquer Gaza. Moshe Smilansky, a farmer and writer who wandered a good deal among the Arabs, saw the waves of refugees and described them in his journal: "All of them bear the mark of hunger, fear and disaster." The disaster was not theirs alone, he wrote: "A terrible panic befell not only the residents of Gaza, but the entire land." Because, he maintained, the authorities intended to resettle some of the Arab refugees in communities belonging to the Jews: "We were very fearful about these guests, because of the overcrowding, lack of cleanliness, and disruption of the usual order. But still we took comfort in this - better that they expel the Arabs to us than that they should expel us to them," Smilansky observed. Little did he know.  
    >   
    > A few weeks later, the residents of Jaffa and Tel Aviv were also forced to leave their homes; some of them found shelter among Arabs.  
    >   
    > Around 50,000 people lived in Jaffa at that time, including some 10,000 Jews; nearly 2,000 Jews lived in the adjacent garden suburb, Tel Aviv. The authorities claimed they had to vacate Jaffa for their own protection. The military governor of the country was Cemal Pasha, one of the leaders of the Young Turk movement, who is also known as the mastermind behind the Armenian genocide. As with the expulsion of the civilian population from Gaza, the authorities claimed that Jaffa's evacuation was necessary to protect the residents, ahead of the British invasion. "You cannot fight for a city to the sound of women screaming and children crying," Cemal Pasha explained.  
    >   
    > A foreign diplomat stationed in Jerusalem at the time offered the view that the authorities were hostile to the Jews of Jaffa and Tel Aviv, and would take advantage of the evacuation to harm the Zionists. He was right: Only a few Jewish youths were given permission to remain in the city to safeguard the houses. All the rest were forced to get out.  
    >   
    > A deathly silence  
    >   
    > The evacuation took about two weeks. It began in an orderly fashion, but rapidly descended into chaos. A local reporter described a confused mob of people, horses and mules, and piles and piles of belongings. Men, women and children were stretched out over their bundles, waiting outside day and night for their turn, until a cart would arrive to collect them. Wagon after wagon departed, numbering in the hundreds: wagons laden with household wares and carpets, heavy furniture and even pianos; wagons full of Torah scrolls from the synagogues; and wagons carrying wheat and other foodstuffs. They left behind them a long trail of animal excrement. Moshe Smilansky saw a baby carriage hitched to a donkey and driven by two children.`

- The armistice was followed by the occupation of Constantinople (now Istanbul) and the subsequent partitioning of the Ottoman Empire. The Treaty of Sèvres (10 August 1920), which was signed in the aftermath of World War I, imposed harsh terms on the Ottoman Empire, but it was never ratified by the Ottoman Parliament in Istanbul.

- > `From the beginning of the war, the Turks had feared a revolt and fifthcolumn activities by Arab nationalists in Damascus and Beirut. At first they tried to conquer Egypt; failing in this, they tried to ward off British counterthrusts toward Palestine and Syria. In 1915-16 Jamal Pasha, commander of the Ottoman Fourth Army and military governor of the Greater Syria region, instituted a reign of terror in which dozens of Arab nationalists were publicly hanged in Damascus and Beirut and hundreds were arrested. Thousands more Palestinian Arabs (as well as Jews) were deported inland, away from the centers of subversion and from likely axes of Allied invasion (and all this even before any concrete anti-Ottoman subversion had taken place). Additional thousands died of disease and starvation, in part as a result of the Ottoman military requisitioning of crops. These events naturally served to intensify Arab nationalist and separatist aspirations.

    > `Egypt forsook the traditional modus operandi of the Arab League-adopting resolutions on the basis of consensus-and fashioned an anti-Iraqi majority coalition from among the 21 League members which both endorsed the mustering of Western forces in the Saudi desert and gave the green light to Arab military participation in the anti-Saddam international coalition.` [[link]](https://www.cartercenter.org/documents/1223.pdf)
    
- According to the Washington Post, classified U.S. reports indicated that then PLO leader Yasser Arafat pressed then Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein to make his withdrawal from Kuwait conditional on the withdrawal of Israel from the West Bank, Gaza Strip and Golan Heights, and on August 12, Saddam announced his offer to conditionally withdraw.
    
    > `The invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2 caught Arafat by surprise, but for whatever reason, he stuck with Saddam and has been advising him on some aspects of Iraq's public response to the buildup of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia. Highly classified U.S. reports indicate that it was Arafat who pressed Saddam to make his withdrawal from Kuwait conditional on the withdrawal of other Middle East nations from the territories they occupy by force.  
    >   
    > On Aug. 12, Saddam offered to withdraw his forces from Kuwait when "all issues of occupation" were resolved, starting with the unconditional withdrawal of Israel from the West Bank, Gaza Strip and Golan Heights.  
    >   
    > The secret part of Saddam's proposal, which would not ingratiate him with the Palestinians, came in his letter to the White House on Aug. 13. He said he would recognize Israel's right to exist. The message, written by hand, was first sent to Washington from Tunis. It was cleaned up in a more formal fashion by Arab sources in Washington before going to the White House. We have seen a copy of the handwritten message. It said, "Iraq is now offering the implementation of all U.N. Security Council resolutions pertaining to the Middle East."`

# 2017 US-Saudi Arms Deal
- On 20 May 2017, Trump sealed a weapons deal with Saudi Arabia worth $350 billion over 10 years, $110 billion of which took effect immediately [[ussaudiarabiasealweaponsdealworthne]]
- During 2018, Trump made several assertions of how many American jobs the deal would create, including as many as 1,000,000. The Washington Post Wrote `We’ve learned over time that the president does not pay much attention to details. So while he keeps increasing the number of jobs that he says would result from this deal, he might be surprised to learn what the official White House statement said when the deal was signed: “This package demonstrates the United States’ commitment to our partnership with Saudi Arabia, while also expanding opportunities for American companies in the region, potentially supporting tens of thousands of new jobs in the United States.” “Tens of thousands” is much, much lower than 600,000. Even that might be a stretch, though note that the statement uses the phrase “potentially supporting,” rather than “creating,” jobs. That means the White House could have been counting not just new factory workers but also secondary jobs resulting from the “feedback” of employed defense workers. (In theory, each dollar spent by a newly employed person reverberates through the economy, creating jobs for dentists, librarians, bread bakers, farmers, bartenders and so forth.)` [[link]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/10/22/trumps-claim-jobs-saudi-deals-grows-by-leaps-bounds/)
- According to a confidential 2017 document of all of the military sales agreements reviewed by The Fact Checker, most of the items on Trump’s $110 billion list did not have delivery dates or were scheduled for 2022 or beyond. There appeared to be few, if any, signed contracts. Rather, many of the announcements were MOIs — memorandums of intent. There were six specific items, adding up to $28 billion, but all had been previously notified to Congress by the Obama administration. [[link]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/10/11/trumps-billion-arms-sales-saudi-arabia-still-fake/)
- Trump vetoed a bipartisan bill that would have ended American involvement in the Yemeni Civil War. `Trump vetoed a bipartisan resolution on Tuesday that would have forced an end to American military involvement in Saudi Arabia’s civil war in Yemen, rejecting an appeal by lawmakers to his own deeply rooted instincts to withdraw the United States from bloody foreign conflicts.` [[link]](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/16/us/politics/trump-veto-yemen.html)
# 2018 Assassination of Jamal Khashoggi
- On 2 October 2018, Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi dissident, journalist, columnist for The Washington Post, former editor of Al-Watan and former general manager and editor-in-chief of the Al-Arab News Channel, was assassinated by agents of the Saudi government at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey.
- Timeline of events, [[thek]]
    - `October 2: Khashoggi was last seen on security camera footage entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on the afternoon of Oct. 2, where he was picking up documents that would allow him to marry his Turkish fiancee.`
    - `October 6: Saudi Arabia’s consul general says that “talk of his kidnapping was baseless,” according to Reuters. On October 8, the crown prince’s brother and Saudi ambassador to Washington Khalid bin Salman reiterated those words to Axios.`
    - `October 10: Turkish authorities release photographs of a 15-member Saudi “hit squad” which included several security officials known to be close to the crown prince. Turkish officials said that within two hours of entering the consulate, Khashoggi was killed by the Saudi agents, who dismembered his body using a bone saw. Local media reveals that the government has audio recordings of Khashoggi’s killing in the consulate.`
        - `Turkish officials have said they possess evidence that the 15 Saudi agents flew into Istanbul on Oct. 2, assassinated Mr. Khashoggi, dismembered his body with a bone saw they had brought for the purpose, and flew out the same day. Records show that two private jets chartered by a Saudi company with close ties to the Saudi crown prince and Interior Ministry arrived and left Istanbul on the day of Mr. Khashoggi’s disappearance. Turkish officials said Mr. Khashoggi was killed within two hours of his arrival at the consulate. That timeline would not have allowed much time for an interrogation to go awry.` [[link]](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/16/world/middleeast/khashoggi-saudi-prince.html)
        - `Turkish officials and investigations by The New York Times have found that Mr. Khashoggi’s killing was the result of a complex operation that involved at least 15 agents who flew into Turkey specifically for the job, many of them closely connected to Prince Mohammed. They included intelligence agents who had travelled with the crown prince, a physician who specialized in autopsies and brought a bone saw, and a body double who donned Mr. Khashoggi’s clothes and walked around Istanbul seeking to leave a false trail of evidence that he was still alive.` [[]]
    - `October 10: A bipartisan group of more than 20 senators pens a letter to the White House triggering the Global Magnitsky Act, which is designed to penalize governments for human rights abuses. This gives the administration four months to carry out an investigation and determine whether abuses occurred. Numerous individual lawmakers from both parties call for sanctions on Saudi Arabia and a halt in arms sales to the kingdom.`
    - `October 12: A Saudi delegation arrives in Turkish capital Ankara for an investigation into the disappearance.`
    - `October 15: Nearly two weeks after Khashoggi went missing, Turkish investigative teams are allowed to begin searching the Saudi consulate.`
    - `October 16: Trump speaks via phone with Crown Prince Mohammed, and tells media the crown prince “totally denied” any knowledge of Khashoggi’s fate.`
    - `October 19: Major General Ahmed al-Asiri, the Saudi deputy intelligence chief and one of bin Salman’s closest aides, is sacked. Saudi officials later named Al-Asiri as having ordered Khashoggi’s repatriation to the kingdom. Saud al Qahtani, the prince’s top aide, is also removed from his position.`
    - `October 21: A Saudi official tells Reuters that Khashoggi died in a “chokehold” after 15 Saudi operatives, which government authorities said were meant to simply detain Khashoggi and take him to Saudi Arabia for questioning, overstepped their orders.`
    - `October 23: Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announces that Khashoggi’s killing was premeditated and planned at the “highest levels” of the Saudi government, but stops short of directly naming the crown prince.`
    - `October 25: Saudi Arabia’s public prosecutor describes the murder as “premeditated,” reversing earlier statements that the death was an accident.`
    - `November 10: Erdogan says Turkey has given audio recordings taken before and during Khashoggi’s murder to the intelligence agencies of Saudi Arabia, the U.S., the U.K., Germany and France. Saudi Arabia tells the UN that the Khashoggi killers will face justice.`
        - `“We gave the tapes. We gave them to Saudi Arabia, to the United States, Germans, French and British, all of them. They have listened to all the conversations in them. They know,” Erdogan said.` [[link]](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-khashoggi-turkey/turkey-gave-khashoggi-tapes-to-european-nations-erdogan-says-idUSKCN1NF0EQ)
    - `November 15: Saudi Arabia’s deputy public prosecutor announces the kingdom will seek the death penalty for five out of the 11 people charged in the murder. He simultaneously exonerates the crown prince of any involvement.`
    - `November 16: The Washington Post reports that CIA assessments have concluded the Saudi crown prince ordered Khashoggi’s killing, citing a source with access to the intelligence. NBC News and the New York Times later confirmed the reports, while the CIA declined to comment.`
    - `November 19: Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir calls the reported CIA assessment false, telling local media: “We in the kingdom know that such allegations about the crown prince have no basis in truth and we categorically reject them.”`
    - `November 21: In an interview with CNBC, Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al Jubeir avidly rejects the CIA assessment and suggestions that the royal family’s line of succession may be changed to prevent the crown prince becoming king. He calls the reports of potential regime change “outrageous” and “totally unacceptable.”`
- On 30 September 2019, Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman denied any personal involvement in the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi but took full responsibility as the country's leader during a CBS "60 Minutes" interview that aired Sunday night.
    - `Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman (Translation): Absolutely not. This was a heinous crime. But I take full responsibility as a leader in Saudi Arabia, especially since it was committed by individuals working for the Saudi government.  
          
        Norah O'Donnell: What does that mean that you take responsibility?  
          
        Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman (Translation): When a crime is committed against a Saudi citizen by officials, working for the Saudi government, as a leader I must take responsibility. This was a mistake. And I must take all actions to avoid such a thing in the future.`

- On 4 October 2019, a United Nations Human Rights Council report on `Annex to the Report of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions: Investigation into the unlawful death of Mr. Jamal Khashoggi` found that, [[link]](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/HRBodies/HRC/RegularSessions/Session41/Documents/A_HRC_41_CRP.1.pdf)
    - `Mr. Khashoggi’s killing constituted an extrajudicial killing for which the State of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is responsible. His attempted kidnapping would also constitute a violation under international human rights law.`
    - `The killing of Mr. Khashoggi further constituted a violation of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (thereafter VCCR) and of the prohibition against the extra-territorial use of force in time of peace (customary law and UN Charter). In killing a journalist, the State of Saudi Arabia also committed an act inconsistent with a core tenet of the United Nations, the protection of freedom of expression. As such, it can be credibly argued that it used force extra-territorially in a manner “inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.”`
    - `Further, the circumstances of the killing of Mr. Khashoggi may constitute an act of torture under the terms of the Convention Against Torture, ratified by Saudi Arabia`
    - `The Special Rapporteur has determined that there is credible evidence, warranting further investigation of high-level Saudi Officials’ individual liability, including the Crown Prince’s.`
    - `The Special Rapporteur has found that both the investigations conducted by Saudi Arabia and Turkey failed to meet international standards regarding the investigation into unlawful deaths.`
    - `On the basis of credible information at her disposal, the Special Rapporteur has concluded that there is insufficient evidence to suggest that either Turkey or the United States knew, or ought to have known, of a real and imminent or foreseeable threat to Mr. Khashoggi’s life. There was credible evidence to suggest that, had Mr. Khashoggi returned to Saudi Arabia, or been lured there, he would have been detained, possibly disappeared, and harmed. These risks were not linked to his life or presence in his countries of residence, namely the US or Turkey. She did not secure credible evidence that US authorities had intercepted the Saudi Crown prince’s communications or that such intercepts had been assessed before the time of the killing of Mr. Khashoggi.`
    - `This report has shown that the execution of Mr. Khashoggi constituted a violation of his right to life for which the State of Saudi Arabia is responsible. This violation has been compounded by Saudi Arabia’s failure to effectively investigate the execution and fairly prosecute those responsible.`
    - `This report has also demonstrated that the execution of Mr. Kashoggi in the Saudi consulate located on the Turkish territory violated two core rules of the international system: the prohibition on extraterritorial use of force and the requirement that states use consular missions for official purposes.`
- A 2021 report from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence found that, [[link]](https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/Assessment-Saudi-Gov-Role-in-JK-Death-20210226v2.pdf)
    - `We assess that Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman approved an operation in Istanbul, Turkey to capture or kill Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.`
    - `We base this assessment on the Crown Prince's control of decision making in the Kingdom, the direct involvement of a key adviser and members of Muhammad bin Salman's protective detail in the operation, and the Crown Prince's support for using violent measures to silence dissidents abroad, including Khashoggi.`
    - `Since 2017, the Crown Prince has had absolute control of the Kingdom's security and intelligence organizations, making it highly unlikely that Saudi officials would have carried out an operation of this nature without the Crown Prince's authorization.`
    - `At the time of the Khashoggi murder, the Crown Prince probably fostered an environment in which aides were afraid that failure to complete assigned tasks might result in him firing or arresting them. This suggests that the aides were unlikely to question Muhammad bin Salman's orders or undertake sensitive actions without his consent.`
    - `The IS-member Saudi team that arrived in Istanbul on 2 October 2018 included officials who worked for, or were associated with, the Saudi Center for Studies and Media Affairs (CSMARC) at the Royal Court. At the time of the operation, CSMARC was led by Saud al-Qahtani, a close adviser of Muhammad bin Salman, who claimed publicly in mid-2018 that he did not make decisions without the Crown Prince's approval.`
    - `The team also included seven members of Muhammad bin Salman's elite personal protective detail, known as the Rapid Intervention Force (RIF). The RIF-a subset of the Saudi Royal Guard-exists to defend the Crown Prince, answers only to him, and had directly participated in earlier dissident suppression operations in the Kingdom and abroad at the Crown Prince's direction. We judge that members of the RIF would not have participated in the operation against Khashoggi without Muhammad bin Salman's approval.`
    - `The Crown Prince viewed Khashoggi as a threat to the Kingdom and broadly supported using violent measures if necessary to silence him. Although Saudi officials had pre-planned an unspecified operation against Khashoggi we do not know how far in advance Saudi officials decided to harm him.`
