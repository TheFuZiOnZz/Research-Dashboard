[Abqaiqâ€“Khurais attack - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abqaiq%E2%80%93Khurais_attack)

 - On 14 September 2019, drones were used to attack oil processing facilities at Abqaiq in eastern Saudi Arabia. The facilities were operated by Saudi Aramco, the country's state-owned oil company. The Houthis in Yemen claimed responsibility, tying it to events surrounding the Saudi intervention in the Yemeni Civil War and stating they used ten drones in the attack launched from Yemen, south of the facilities. Saudi Arabian officials said that many more drones and cruise missiles were used for the attack and originated from the north and east, and that they were of Iranian manufacture. The United States and Saudi Arabia have stated that Iran was behind the attack while France, Germany, and the United Kingdom jointly stated Iran bears responsibility for it. Iran has denied any involvement. The situation exacerbated the 2019 Persian Gulf crisis.
