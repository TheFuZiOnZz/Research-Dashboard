## Modern Monetary Theory
- MMT doesn't have a testable, falsifiable hypothesis that we can compare to neoclassical economics.
    - `ME/MMT is distinguished by its explicit recognition that the currency itself is a public monopoly, which is the micro foundation of fiat currency. MEMMT then builds the ramifications of that fundamental understanding.` - [link](http://www00.unibg.it/dati/corsi/910003/64338-Warren%20Mosler%20Bergamo%20paper%20March%2010.pdf)
- MMT claims that currency is a tax credit but doesn't explain the format of that tax credit, unlike conventional tax credits which are in dollars, which would make tax credits - currency - tax credits which is circular.
    - `ME/MMT recognizes that with fiat currency, the funds the government spends are best thought of as tax credits. Likewise, the funds the government spends that are not immediately used to pay taxes remain in the economy as ‘monetary savings’ until used to pay taxes in the future. Furthermore, these tax credits outstanding constitute what is called the ‘national debt’.` - [link](http://www00.unibg.it/dati/corsi/910003/64338-Warren%20Mosler%20Bergamo%20paper%20March%2010.pdf)
- MMT has also been explained by its founder very similarly to what the U.S. Federal Reserve already does, making it a subject within Keynesian Economics.
    - `MEMMT presumes the role of government is to establish and sustain public infrastructure for public purpose, and that the currency is a tool of government for the promotion of public purpose. Accordingly, what MEMMT offers are fiscal and monetary proposals that sustain employment opportunities for anyone willing and able to work, and that optimize real terms of trade, all in support of real standards of living.` - [link](http://www00.unibg.it/dati/corsi/910003/64338-Warren%20Mosler%20Bergamo%20paper%20March%2010.pdf)    
- An IGM survey of a panel of 26 economists found that 0% agree with MMT in any degree of agreement. [link](https://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/modern-monetary-theory/)
- MMT has been tried in various Latin American countries and caused runaway inflation, huge currency devaluations, and precipitous real wage declines.
    - `Almost every one of the Latin American experiments with major central bank–financed fiscal expansions took place under populist regimes, and all of them ended up badly, with runaway inflation, huge currency devaluations, and precipitous real wage declines. In most of these episodes — Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Peru, and Venezuela — policymakers used arguments similar to those made by MMTers to justify extensive use of money creation to finance very large increases in public expenditures.` - [link](https://www.cato.org/cato-journal/fall-2019/modern-monetary-theory-cautionary-tales-latin-america)
- In a PBS interview with Paul Krugman on Modern Monetary Theory, he is asked about the claim of `The Government Cannot Go Bankrupt` made by MMTers and replies,
    - `Yeah, this is basically true, but you don't need a new theory for that, we kinda knew that already. To a large extent, they're just doing Keynesian Economics, but they don't know they're doing Keynesian Economics and they've invented their own terminology for it.` - [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gyj1H-gjI8)
